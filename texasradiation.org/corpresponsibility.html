Note: Much of this section discusses the company GNI and their old sites in the Houston area.  As of 2005, 17 workers who were 
involved with GNI have filed a lawsuit charging that they are exhibiting signs of overexposure to radiation from 
working at the sites.  Two of the main news items regarding this have been pasted at the bottom, below the discussion 
of how the company filed for bankruptcy and left a huge mess for taxpayers to cover.

<B>Radioactive Waste and Corporate Responsibility</B>
<BR>
In our overview of uranium sites in Texas, there were some fairly startling examples of 
irresponsible behaviour on the part of corporations, aside from the fact that many of 
those sites were simply abandoned to be cleaned up by state or federal bodies.  One of the big concerns over a 
Texas waste dump have been about title and bankruptcy.  In Texas, the law states that a private company which owns a dump
can make their billions in profits and then file bankruptcy, transfering the ownership of the waste to the
State of Texas.   In previous sessions, the bill actually directly assigned ownership to the State upon waste receipt on-site.
This functions as a back door for licensees to escape liability through, and one 
might have noticed that all of the companies involved in the waste industry have obtained limited liability status 
as well.  The bottom line is that if a waste broker is allowed to build a dump, they can make their profits by accepting waste
and then later file for bankruptcy and walk away leaving the liability to the taxpayers.

<BR><BR>
Under the law, to qualify for licensing a company needs to demonstrate that they have the financial assurance to 
cover decommissioning costs, which allows for some cleanup money in the event that the company goes under.  Below we 
look over the example of Gulf Nuclear, which had two processing/ production facilities, and not a waste dump.
The Houston Chronicle said that the TDH-BRC insisted that the decommissioning money which would have been earmarked for cleanup at GNI sites
 would never have been enough to cover the entire cost. 
 Obviously, this is very serious, and tells us that the law is requiring insufficient financial assurance for 
 these sites.  
 <BR><BR>
 Insufficient decommissioning funds are also a huge issue with nuclear power plants.    During the early 1990's,
 this became the topic of much discussion when it was found that Texas nuclear plant operators
 had hardly contributed a significant funds to the task.   The 
 Price Anderson Act was enacted by the US Congress to provide financial assurance to
nuclear power stations.  The allocated funds, however, are also insufficient to meet the estimated coverage of damages in event of an accident.

<B>Gulf Nuclear's Houston Sites at Webster and Tavenor</B>
<BR>

Gulf Nuclear of Louisiana Inc. (GNI) avoided cleanup responsibility for two sites it
 operated in the Houston area.
In 1992, GNI had filied a Chapter 11
bankruptcy statement and walked away from its properties.  By 2002, it also was granted a request for
 chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Last year, since Gulf Nuclear still had not done anything to clean
the heavily contaminated Webster site, the EPA was called to the task, using
emergency Superfund money. 
 <BR><BR>
A team comprising workers from the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and a private environmental cleanup company established
temporary offices  on site, and assigned 24-hour security.
 
After assessing the sites, the EPA estimated an $8.5 million tab for what the Houston Chronicle 
called a "virtually unprecedented and dangerous nuclear mess." Later, this figure jumped to $9.6 million. 

Some material from the Webster building was so radioactive it could not be
legally be disposed of at any existing facility in the United States.  This material is now stored at WCS,
 and slated for disposal at Yucca Mountain.   The rest of the sites waste, including the rubblized buildings,
has been sent to the LLW disposal sites in Clive, Utah and Barnwell, South Carolina.  Cleanup at the Webster 
location was declared completed on December 13, 2002.

<BR><BR>



Michael Dunn with the Bureau of Radiation Control said there was no indication that any
radiation had escaped the building and threatened the surrounding
communities. 
Greg Fife, an EPA veteran who was the on-site coordinator for the
cleanup, said that when he and other federal officials first entered the
Webster building in January, they expected to find most of the
contamination confined to the "hot room," a sealed, lead-lined area
where the radioactive materials were kept and handled. They also
expected to find the radiation was coming from about 12 sources. 
  Instead, they found more than 360 sources, and contamination so
widespread that workers almost certainly were exposed to very high, very
dangerous levels of radioactivity.  In one area outside the "hot room," Fife said workers would have been
exposed to one year's worth of acceptable radiation in 38 minutes. 
  "Anybody that's been in there would have no reluctance to call the
operation sloppy and unprofessional," Fife said. 
<BR><BR>


Fife said americium-241 contamination in the Webster building was
widespread.  Glove
boxes coated with radioactive powder, raw
materials spilled on the floor, and evidence that workers
used plastic coffee cups to mix radioactive chemicals, which were stored
in plastic ice trays. Investigators even found a sealed room with fake walls in which was
entombed thousands of dollars worth of contaminated equipment.
  Radioactive rats and roaches also have been discovered at the Webster
                                   site. 


<br><br>
"Housekeeping was extremely poor," said Fife in a Jan. 27 memo. "Protective containers were left open,
                                   radium needles are scattered on the floor, and the ventilation system is
                                   highly contaminated. ... Some areas have radiation levels high enough
                                   to provide the yearly permissible dose in a very short period of time."
<BR><BR>

"I've done this for 15 years," Fife said. "I've seen nasty sites where things fell apart because
of a lack of money. I've seen cases where the owners of a facility
couldn't cope with the problem. But I have never seen such total
disregard for the neighbors or the workers." 

<BR><BR>

Gulf Nuclear began operations at the two sites in 1971, initially
supplying radioactive tracers for the oil industry. Over time it began
making devices using Americium-241, beryllium, cesium-137, irridium-192
and other isotopes that were used for a variety of purposes from medical
diagnostic devices, aircraft fuel gauges, to fluid-density gauges. 
<BR><BR>

Virtually all the contamination at both sites occurred between 1971 and
1992- the year that Gulf Nuclear filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
seeking protection from its creditors while it reorganized. The company
then filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000, seeking to liquidate and
close.   During this time, little was done to clean up the Webster facility.  
"Basically they just walked off," he said. "They got their money during
the oil boom and then they just walked off." 
Fife said. 

<BR><BR>


Dunn said department inspectors visited the facilities once or twice a
year. The reason nothing alerted inspectors to problems that according
to Fife were evident, could be that "they weren't told some things,"
Dunn said. The Gulf Nuclear operation is one of only two of its kind in the state
licensed by the health department, Dunn said.  "This is a rare one," he said.






<BR><BR>


 Carl Shaw, president and CEO of The GNI
Group, the parent company of Gulf Nuclear, did not return a phone call
to his home seeking comment. Neither did two attorneys representing him.
But in an affidavit filed in support of his company's 2000 bankruptcy
petition, he states GNI has five wholly owned subsidiaries, including
Gulf Nuclear of Louisiana Inc. 

On Sept. 12, 2000, a year before any regulatory agencies were involved
in the cleanup, Shaw stated under oath, that Gulf Nuclear's properties
are "currently undergoing decontamination" and that once that is
completed they will be "released for sale by the appropriate regulatory
authorities."  The EPA's Fife said nothing of any substance had been done to
decontaminate the Webster facility before the EPA's involvement in
October 2001. 



<BR><BR>

                                   The Houston Chronicle said that Health Department officials had
                                   acknowledged that Gulf
                                   Nuclear's failure to submit a decommissioning and funding plan may
                                   have compromised the state's earlier efforts to get money out of the
                                   bankruptcy to cover the cleanup, but they insist that it would never
                                   have been enough to cover the entire cost. 
<BR><BR>


 In September, state Assistant Attorney General Hal Morris, sent an
e-mail to his clients at the Health Department, whom he represented in
the bankruptcy case. "Having no funds with which to remediate the GNL radiated assets ...
                                   the two facilities will need to be addressed with State Funds. ... It is
                                   indeed a sad day for the taxpayers of this state. We tried our best. I'm
                                   very sorry." 
              
                 <BR><BR>                  
      
                                   A spokesman for the state attorney general's office said the state and
                                   the EPA will be filing a joint administrative claim to recoup some of
                                   the cleanup expenses from GNI.   Cleanup at the two sites was declared 
                                   completed in December.  Most of the waste was sent to 
                                   Barnwell, and Envirocare's site in Utah.

Radiation poisoning claimed in lawsuit
<BR>
City man, 17 others say job in Texas violated federal safety law
<BR>

<BR><BR>
(March 10, 2005) Ñ In the fearful days after the September 2001
terrorist attacks, Texas authorities told their counterparts in
Washington, D.C., about a building in suburban Houston that could be
used as a terrorist's workshop.
<BR><BR>
The abandoned industrial site was filled with radioactive cesium and
americium Ñ just the sort of material that someone bent on terror could
use to make radiological "dirty bombs."
<BR><BR>
In 2002, federal authorities began to clean up and raze the building.
Within a year's time, the radioactive material was shipped off to secure
disposal facilities.
<BR><BR>
Now, however, a Rochester man and 17 other people are claiming that the
problem didn't really end there. In a lawsuit filed in state Supreme
Court here, they say they suffered serious radiation contamination while
cleaning up the site.
<BR><BR>
"They did a lot of work there, but they were put in constant danger
every day," said Linda R. Shaw, the workers' Rochester attorney. "Some
of them have been, we believe, significantly overexposed."
<BR><BR>
She said the working conditions were so unsafe that many workers left
the job because of it.
<BR><BR>
In legal papers filed March 1, the plaintiffs said the company
conducting the cleanup, Shaw Group Inc., failed to provide adequate
protection to workers and allowed them to suffer "excessive external and
internal radiation exposure."
<BR><BR>
The papers accuse Shaw Group of violating federal regulations and
industry standards and of ignoring the workers' complaints about safety.
<BR><BR>
In some cases, the plaintiffs' attorney said, radioactive contamination
was found on workers' clothing and in their vehicles and homes.
<BR><BR>
The lawyer said two workers have records verifying they were exposed to
radiation beyond that allowed by federal guidelines. Shaw Ñ who said she
has no connection to the company despite having the same name Ñ said the
lawsuit was filed after the Shaw Group failed to provide exposure
records for other workers.
<BR><BR>
Chris Sammons, a spokesman for the Shaw Group, based in Baton Rouge,
La., said Wednesday that the company does not comment on pending
litigation.
<BR><BR>
Two of the plaintiffs, including northwest Rochester resident Dominic
Cotroneo, have suffered health problems that may be linked to the
exposure, their attorney said. Among other things, Cotroneo suffered
hair loss, which can by a symptom of acute radiation exposure, Linda
Shaw said.
<BR><BR>
The workers also are concerned that they may have an increased risk of
cancer or other illnesses. The lawsuit is seeking damages plus money
that would be set aside to monitor the workers' health.
<BR><BR>
The 17 plaintiffs, who were employed by subcontractors that supplied
labor to the Shaw Group, are what are known in the nuclear power
industry as "jumpers" Ñ specially trained workers who travel from job to
job, toiling for limited amounts of time in radioactive environments at
each stop. Six plaintiffs live elsewhere in New York; the rest reside in
other states.
<BR><BR>
Richard Ratliff, who heads the radiation control unit at the Texas
Department of State Health Services, said the former Gulf Nuclear site
was a well-known problem spot whose former owner had filed bankruptcy.
<BR><BR>
The abandoned building, in the Houston suburb of Webster, had been used
to manufacture radioactive sensors used in the oil industry. It
contained raw cesium and americium as well as finished sensors.
<BR><BR>
After the terrorist attacks, state health officials worried about the
dirty-bomb potential and notified the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Ratliff said. The concern was grave enough that officials posted
guards around the site before and during the cleanup.
<BR><BR>
Though Texas officials had no formal oversight of the project, Ratliff
said he heard that some cleanup workers had suffered relatively minor
overexposure to radiation. But the exposures he heard about should not
have caused acute health problems, Ratliff said.

Workers claim they suffered radiation poisoning during Texas cleanup
<BR>
Associated Press
<BR><BR>
ROCHESTER, N.Y. - A group of nuclear-industry workers who helped clean
up a contaminated industrial site in Texas in 2002 claim in a federal
lawsuit they suffered serious radiation poisoning because their
Louisiana-based employer failed to provide adequate safeguards.
<BR><BR>
Eighteen people employed by subcontractors allege that Shaw Group Inc.,
based in Baton Rouge, La., created such unsafe working conditions at the
former Gulf Nuclear site in suburban Houston that many workers ended up
walking off the job.
<BR><BR>
Shaw Group failed to provide adequate protection to workers and allowed
them to suffer "excessive external and internal radiation exposure,"
according to the lawsuit filed last week at the federal court in
Rochester.
<BR><BR>
One worker, Dominic Cotroneo of Rochester, suffered health problems that
may be linked to acute radiation exposure, including hair loss, attorney
Linda Shaw said.
<BR><BR>
"They were put in constant danger every day," Shaw said. "Some of them
have been, we believe, significantly overexposed."
<BR><BR>
The workers, six of whom reside in New York state, accuse Shaw Group of
violating federal regulations and industry standards and ignoring their
complaints about safety. The Shaw Group declined to comment on the
lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages.
<BR><BR>
The industrial site in the Houston suburb of Webster, where radioactive
sensors used in the oil industry were once made, was filled with
radioactive cesium and americium - radiological material that federal
authorities feared could potentially be used to make "dirty bombs."
<BR><BR>
The building was cleaned up and razed and the hazardous material was
shipped to secure disposal sites.
