<B><font color="black">Uranium Mining Coming back + Historical Pollution Back in the News</B></font><BR>
<BR>
During the 79th Session, we discussed Rep. "Buddy" West's bill to deregulate mining by giving oversight to the 
non-nuclear Railroad Commission.  Also mentioned was the committee amendment that got attached 
to Sen. Duncan's mostly-otherwise good bill, an amendment which restricts public participation 
in the licensing process for uranium mines.  Several companies with interests in uranium mining have been 
lobbying this session, primarily encouraged by the Bush Administration's renewed nuclear energy program,
its push for opening new plants (as well as grandfathering old ones), and the fuel that will be required 
to power these plants.  Uranium prices have reportedly soared from about $8 a pound to $29 a pound in the
past three years- however,   <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('action-uranium-prices.html')">
this recent article from  WISE Uranium out of the Nuclear Monitor says pricing isn't quite what it sounds
like when you take a closer look.</A>

Simply put, companies new and old to Texas mining are coming to mine more.
Opponents of further mining have refered to the long well-documented history and
legacy pollution of uranium mining in Texas, in the 18 counties in which these activities have occurred.
Primarily what has concerned residents has been thier drinking water, and the proliferation of
health problems in the region. They have fought this issue for decades and continue to persevere.

<B>Uranium Resources Inc. in Kleberg County (mostly edited from AP articles)</B>
<BR>
Kleberg county reached a settlement in December with
Lewisville-based Uranium Resources Inc. (URI), 
regarding their polluted mines near Kingsville.
<BR><BR>
The settlement allows the company to resume mining as
long as it continues cleanup. Under the agreement, the
company must clean up its first old mine before
starting mining on the third, the second mine
before completing the third, then the third mine
before starting on the fourth. 
The company also must pay the
county $20,000 for an expert to monitor their
cleanup.
<BR><BR>
County Judge Pete De La Garza stated it was the best
way to assure that the roughly $5 million in
cleanup would be done. "We had two choices, the way I see it," he said.
"The first choice was just to not allow them to
mine, let them go away and leave our water dirty.
The second I thought was more prudent - to get our
water cleaned up. We're talking about millions of
dollars."

<BR><BR>

URI wants to
restart at a previous site, plus renew permits for two injection
wells.  Hearings before Judge Paul Keeper are expected
to last two weeks in early August. Keeper will then make a
recommendation to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality in the fall.

Residents had been holding fundraising events and raffles to hire the needed groundwater experts.
"We have been fighting this for 20 years. We're not going to stop," former local school principal
Edna Figueroa said. "It's just, please God, keep the pennies coming so we can get to Aug. 1."


<BR><BR>
The company had suspending mining in the 1990s, claiming 
financial problems, and stating that 
it was unable to complete water restoration. The state allowed
URI to use some of its bond money to guarantee
cleanup to begin restoration, and URI says
restoration is proceeding.
<BR><BR>
Melanie Oberlin, an attorney for the citizens'
group South Texas Opposes Pollution, said
residents believe URI broke promises made in the
1980s that it would clean the wells within two
years of completing mining.  


<BR><BR>



As recently as October 2004, contamination of the Goliad Aquifer reached the news
when residents of rural Kleberg County near Kingsville 
were notified by the EPA that uranium and radiation levels as high as eight
times the federal safety standards had been detected in the water wells.  
They were told to not drink the water and advised to see their doctors because of a high risk of
cancer.
<BR><BR>

Among them was the Garcia family, who had been in the area for long enough for the area to be named 
Garcia Hill.  URI well casings stick out of the ground on Garcia
Hill, where they previously had been conducting operations,
yet the company told the Garcias that the contamination is natural
seepage from the vein of the radioactive material
that runs near their well, a well the Garcias had drawn
drinking water from for five generations.  
<BR><BR>

South Texas Opposes Pollution (STOP), a group of locals of the rural county,
had hired an engineer who mapped the underground for them in the
mid-1990s, and accurately predicted that
contamination from the mine field would migrate
first to the Garcia wells.  "The promise was they would take all the uranium
and leave the water clean," said Teo Saenz,
president of STOP. "They
didn't."

<BR><BR>


URI denies having any role in the 
environmental problems nearby, arguing that the "contamination seeped naturally into the wells and
likely had been there for years."  
Mark Pelizza, URI vice president of health, safety
and environmental affairs was quoted saying, "the
only person they could assign blame to is Mother
Nature," and other URI officials were quoted
saying that the waste product injected back
underground "is cleaner than the original."
"The ground water in the mine zone ... is radioactive today, 
(and) was radioactive when Columbus came through," URI
attorney Jep Hill said. "The materials are there ... and URI is doing its best to remove
materials."

<a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('texasmining.html')">Our section on mining</A> details how these operations 
  contaminated aquifers and groundwater in an 18-county region from 1955-1990, from percolation through the topsoil to injecting waste 
  underground back into the aquifer strata.  The process used, called in-situ leech mining, injects an ammonium 
  bicarbonate solution to dissolve the clays neighboring the aquifer, which previously had the uranium 
  and radium locked away safely inside, away from the environment.  This slurry is then pumped to the surface, 
  the uranium is leeched out, and the remaining slurry waste of ammonia and radium 
  is injected back down into the aquifer area as a disposal method.  Not only have they released the uranium, radium, 
  and other toxins such as arsenic from being locked inside the clay into the aquifer, 
  but are now also introducing ammonia, and other chemicals.
<BR><BR>


STOP members hold little hope that they'll stop
what will be URI's third and fourth mines. They
said Kleberg County officials let them down by
signing the settlement agreement.  "The settlement 
basically says they will make a
'good faith effort' to clean up the water,"
one member said. "It was a very big blow to us."
