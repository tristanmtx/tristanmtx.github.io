Dear Mr. Burnett:
<BR><BR>
The Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Radiation Control has received a request from Waste Control
Specialists LLC (WCS) for approval to transfer electric arc furnace dust (United States Environmental
Protection Agency designation KO61) contaminated with cesium-137 (Cs-137) to the WCS hazardous
waste disposal facility (Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Permit No. HW-50358) for
disposal. This request is made under the provisions of  Section (&sect;) 289.202(ff)(2) of Title 25 of the Texas
Administrative Code (25 TAC). A copy of the request is enclosed. The material in question is indicated
to contain 275 millicuries (mCi) of Cs-137.
<BR><BR>
25 TAC &sect; 289.202(ff)(5) requires that our agency consult with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission to determine that the transfer of the material will not result in the hazardous waste disposal
facility exceeding one (1) curie (Ci) of incident-related Cs-137. We request your confirmation, as the
Director of the Industrial and Hazardous Waste Division, that the transfer of this material to the WCS
hazardous waste disposal facility will not result in the facility possessing more than 1 Ci of incident-
related Cs-137.
<BR><BR>
Our records indicate that 377.4 mCi of Cs-137-contaminated KO61 has previously been transferred to
this facility. The additional 275 mCi represented by this request will result in a total of 652.4 mCi being
received under the provisions of 25 TAC &sect; 289.202(ff)(5).
<BR><BR>
If you have any questions regarding this request, Mr. Philip Shaver of my staff will provide you with the
details. Mr. Shaver may be contacted by telephone at (512) 834-6688, extension 2210, or via the Internet
at phil.shaver@tdh.state.tx.us.

Sincerely,
