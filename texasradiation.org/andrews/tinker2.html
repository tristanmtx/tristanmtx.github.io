Dear Mr. Alford:
<BR><BR>
Pursuant to our telephone conservation on February 24, 1998 regarding the
relocation of WS #2 materials currently stored at your Andrews, TX facility, the
foilowing inforrnation is provided for your consideration. I am pleased to inform
you that IT Corporation (IT), acting as a contractor for the U.S. Anny Corp of
Engineers, has monies available to relocate this material in the very unlikely
event that WCS requires such action. IT would request of WCS as much advance
notice as reasonable (3-4 weeks) to facilitate a smooth removal and transition
in relocating these materials.
<BR><BR>
In regard to your letter of February 12, 1998 you will find attached a signed
copy of your Standard Service agreement.
<BR><BR>
In a parallel effort I have forwarded your request for completion of a waste
profile sheet to Mr. Ben Pof of our KnoxviIle, TN office.  Mr. Poff is the
individual who profiled, manifested and shipped the subject material to your
Andrews, TX facility. Should you seek additional information he may be contacted
at 423/690-3211.
<BR><BR>
If you have questions and comments on the enclosed or referenced information
please do not hesitate to contact me at 405/733-1114.
