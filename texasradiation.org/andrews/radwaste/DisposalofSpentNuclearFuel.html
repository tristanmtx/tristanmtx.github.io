DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY


Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-level Radioactive Waste
at Yucca Mountain

AGENCY: Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of
Energy.

ACTION: Notice of availability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing the availability
of

[[Page 36790]]

the ``Summary of Public Scoping Comments Related to the Environmental
Impact Statement for a Geologic Repository for the Disposal of Spent
Nuclear Fuel and High-level Radioactive Waste at Yucca Mountain, Nye
County, Nevada'' (hereafter referred to as the comment summary
document).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Wendy R. Dixon, Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) Project Manager, Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management, U.S. Department of Energy, 1180 Town Center Drive, MS/010,
Las Vegas, Nevada 89134, 1-800-967-3477.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE is preparing an EIS pursuant to the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended (NWPA), for a geologic repository
for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive
waste (HLW) at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada. On August 7, 1995
DOE published a notice of intent (60 FR 40164) encouraging the general
public, Federal agencies, state and local government agencies, Native
American tribal organizations, public interest groups, transportation
interests, and industry and utility organizations to participate in the
scoping process for the EIS. DOE held fifteen public scoping meetings
across the country between August 29 and October 24, 1995 to allow
interested parties the opportunity to present oral and written
comments. As mentioned in the notice of intent, although the 120-day
scoping period closed on December 5, 1995, DOE will consider comments
received after that date to the extent practicable. DOE welcomes such
comments, which may be submitted in writing to Ms. Dixon at the address
above. Alternatively, comments may also be submitted through the
internet and e-mail addresses identified in the ``Availability''
discussion below.
    Shortly after the scoping period closed, funding to continue the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process was discontinued in
accordance with Fiscal Year 1996 budgetary reductions, until October 1,
1996 (the beginning of Fiscal Year 1997). During the interim, on July
9, 1996, to simplify the DOE NEPA process, reduce cost, and save time,
DOE published a final rule (61 FR 36222) eliminating the requirement in
its new regulations to prepare implementation plans. The elimination of
this requirement, however, did not affect the requirement to consider
public scoping comments and factor them into the preparation of the
EIS.
    Although not required to do so, DOE has prepared a comment summary
document to inform the public of the results of the scoping process.
The comment summary document summarizes and categorizes comments
received during the public scoping process into issue areas, and
discusses how these issue areas will be addressed in the EIS.
    As discussed in the Notice of Intent to prepare the EIS (60 FR
40164), the NWPA directs DOE to evaluate the suitability of the Yucca
Mountain site as a potential site for a geologic repository for the
disposal of SNF and HLW. If the Secretary of Energy determines that the
Yucca Mountain site is suitable, the Secretary may then recommend that
the President approve the site for development of a repository. Under
the NWPA, any such recommendation is considered a major Federal action
and must be accompanied by a final EIS. The NWPA states that the EIS
need not consider the need for a repository, alternatives to geologic
disposal, or alternative sites to the Yucca Mountain site. Therefore,
as described in the Notice of Intent, the proposed action would be to
construct, operate, and eventually close a repository at Yucca Mountain
for the geologic disposal of commercial and DOE-owned SNF and HLW.
    SNF and HLW generate heat as a result of radioactive decay. The
amount of heat generated is important because of its potential for
changing the long-term performance characteristics of a repository. The
amount of heat in a repository, or ``thermal load'', can be controlled
by varying how densely SNF or HLW is placed in a repository, as well as
by selective placement of fuels that have different ages. Packing SNF
and HLW packages closely together would generate an upper range of
repository temperatures. In contrast, packing SNF and HLW farther apart
would generate a lower range of repository temperatures. DOE has
identified three implementation alternatives, based on thermal load
objectives, that would implement the proposed action. The EIS will
therefore evaluate three thermal load ranges: High Thermal Load
(emplacement of greater than 80 Metric Tons of Heavy Metal (MTHM) SNF
and HLW per acre); Low Thermal Load (less than 40 MTHM per acre); and
Intermediate Thermal Load (between 40 and 80 MTHM per acre). For each
of these implementation alternatives, DOE will include an evaluation of
different SNF and HLW packaging and transportation options.
    Under the NWPA DOE is prohibited from emplacing more than 70,000
MTHM of SNF and HLW in the first repository until such time as a second
repository is in operation. Many comments received during the scoping
process requested that the EIS evaluate not only the disposal of 70,000
MTHM of SNF and HLW, but also the disposal of all existing and
projected SNF and HLW. In addition, commentors noted that in recent
planning and NEPA documents, DOE has indicated that other waste types,
such as commercial Greater-than-Class C low-level waste, may require
permanent isolation in a geologic repository, and therefore should also
be considered as candidates for disposal in this EIS.
    As discussed in the comment summary document, the EIS will continue
to evaluate the proposed action and three thermal load implementation
alternatives, as well as a no action alternative. The no action
alternative will include the termination of site characterization
activities at Yucca Mountain and the continued accumulation of SNF and
HLW at commercial storage sites and DOE facilities. In addition, based
on the scoping comments received, DOE is also considering including an
analysis of the incremental environmental impacts from the disposal of
all existing and projected SNF and HLW, and other highly radioactive
waste types that may require permanent isolation, even though disposal
at Yucca Mountain of some of these materials is not explicitly
authorized.
