    <h3><!--HEADLINE BETWEEN HERE-->WCS still pursuing napalm contract<!--AND HERE--></h3>
    <p><em><!--BYLINE BETWEEN HERE--></em>By Greg Harman<em><!--AND HERE--><br>
    Odessa American</em></p>
    <p><!--STORY BETWEEN HERE-->EUNICE, N.M. &#151; The Navy&#146;s primary contractor for napalm disposal will review
    a proposal from Waste Control Specialists to build a napalm-burning incinerator on lands
    recently donated by WCS to the Lea County Solid Waste Authority outside Eunice.</p>
    <p>But WCS officials are downplaying the project&#146;s possibility.</p>
    <p>&quot;I would describe this as the backup to a backup to a backup plan, with a very low
    probability of happening,&quot; said Waste Control lawyer John Kyte.</p>
    <p>&quot;If for some reason GNI (a Deer Park, Texas company) can&#146;t handle the napalm,
    we will be available to receive, treat and ship it off for waste-derived fuel.&quot;</p>
    <p>GNI won a contract from Battelle Memorial Institute last July to receive the napalm and
    prepare it for disposal.</p>
    <p>Battelle is the Navy&#146;s contractor for the disposal of 3.3 million gallons of
    napalm stored at Fallbrook Naval Weapons Support Facility.</p>
    <p>WCS officials pitched the idea of accepting some of the napalm several weeks ago, said
    Robin Yocum, a spokesman with Battelle.</p>
    <p>However, Yocum said there is an obstacle: WCS has nowhere to send the material.</p>
    <p>&quot;We are not interested in incinerating this stuff just for the sake of
    incinerating it,&quot; he said. &quot;We have all along intended to have this burned for
    fuel.&quot;</p>
    <p>That could be settled by the construction of a kiln in Eunice.</p>
    <p>A railroad spur already exists that could bring the napalm &#151; a mixture of 46
    percent polystyrene, 33 percent gasoline and 21 percent benzene &#151; into Lea County,
    Kyte said.</p>
    <p>The power generated through burning the napalm by such a kiln could be sold and sent to
    the power grid, he added. Or it could feed the WCS operations across the state line in
    Andrews County.</p>
    <p>Industrial kilns require &quot;very high quality fuel&quot; and burn &quot;extremely
    clean,&quot; Kyte said.</p>
    <p>The napalm is being shipped to GNI for mixing. From there, it is sent to Chem Waste
    Management Facility in Port Arthur for disposal.</p>
    <p>&quot;They are doing a splendid job,&quot; Yocum said of GNI. &quot;We are delighted
    with the work they are doing.&quot;</p>
    <p>But Kyte said GNI has had difficulties.</p>
    <p>&quot;GNI was shipping to Port Arthur, but that option is no longer available and they
    have been unable to find someone else to take it.&quot;</p>
    <p>GNI spokesperson Bill Reeves confirmed there have been holdups.</p>
    <p>Small quantities of the waste are still going to Port Arthur, but the larger user of
    napalm, a sulfuric acid regeneration furnace in Baton Rouge, La., owned by Rhodia, has
    been forced to stop taking the fuel.</p>
    <p>&quot;They are on hold because the governor asked that shipments not occur on a regular
    basis until he has looked the project over,&quot; Reeves said.</p>
    <p>Since then, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has sent the governor a
    written recommendation supporting the project, Reeves added.</p>
    <p>&quot;We should be back up in the next few weeks.&quot;</p>
    <p>But 3.3 million gallons may not disappear so quickly, Yocum conceded, and it may become
    necessary to contract out with other companies.</p>
    <p>That is why Battelle has agreed to hear a proposal from WCS, he said.</p>
    <p>Gayle Garner, general counsel for Camino Real, the environmental engineering group
    hired to run the Lea County landfill, said the solid waste landfill probably would open in
    June.</p>
    <p>But the incinerator proposal is a separate matter from the landfill, he said.</p>
    <p>&quot;We are only interested spectators in this,&quot; he said.</p>
