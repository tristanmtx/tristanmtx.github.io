					<td><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Moments after leaving the gallery, House Speaker Billy Clayton,

						a lobbyist who hasn't presided over the House since 1983 but is

						still regularly referred to as &#147;Mr. Speaker,&#148; confirmed that H.B.

						1171 would be up &#147;in just a few minutes.&#148; And within a few minutes,

						Pasadena Senator Buster Brown made the motion to bring the bill

						up for debate. The Senate doesn't have a calendar, but sometimes

						it works like a clock.<br><br>

						Clayton is one of thirty-seven lobbyists who had worked on the

						radioactive waste disposal bill Brown was carrying in the Senate.

						In fact, so many lobbyists were working the bill as it was being

						debated in the House on May 6, that outside the chamber some lobbyists

						were reduced to lobbying reporters. <br><br>

						Despite the intense armtwisting, the low-level radioactive waste

						bill voted out of the House Environmental Regulation Committee

						in April represented a real victory for the environmental community

						that earlier had prevailed in the fight to keep the rad-waste

						dump out of Sierra Blanca. (Last October, after eight years before

						courts and state agencies, that site was declared unsuitable for

						the burial of radioactive waste.) And the environmentalists had

						won more than a siting fight; they had convinced House Environmental

						Regulation Committee Chairman Warren Chisum that burial of radioactive

						waste is not a safe practice.<br><br>

						Chisum, a Pampa Republican most notorious for his anti-gay legislative

						agenda, is by no stretch of the imagination an environmentalist.

						From the dais in the hearing room where his committee meets, Chisum

						often argues with pro-environmental witnesses. He has said that

						his cattle graze along the fence line of the Pantex <br><br>

						nuclear weapons plant in Amarillo. &#147;I don't see the hair standing

						up on their back,&#148; Chisum said, dismissing an El Paso high school

						teacher's concerns about radioactivity. Chisum openly ridicules

						the state's finding that a fault line under the proposed Sierra

						Blanca radioactive waste site makes the site unsafe, referring

						to &#147;the earthquake 10,000 years ago.&#148; When Fort Worth Representative

						Lon Burnam said he would use a floor amendment to add a pro-environmental

						measure to the waste disposal bill, Chisum warned that the amendment

						&#147;would get a cold, cold reception on the floor of the House.&#148;

						And on one occasion Chisum was both bemused and bothered to find

						himself on the same side of an issue as the Sierra Club's Ken

						Kramer. <br><br>

						But as radioactive waste disposal hearings progressed in his House

						committee, Chisum gradually embraced two fundamental environmental

						positions. One is that radioactive waste should not be buried,

						but instead stored in &#147;above-ground, retrievable&#148; containers,

						in what is commonly referred to as &#147;assured isolation.&#148; The other

						is that the state should hold the license for any private contractor

						that disposes of radioactive waste in Texas. The bill sent out

						of Chisum's committee more than two months ago included measures

						intended to keep the radioactive dump license in the hands of

						the state. It also encouraged above-ground assured isolation.

						<br><br>

						Yet on the House floor on May 6 &#151; despite the angry protest of

						Chisum and the House's small &#147;green caucus&#148; &#151; Panhandle Republican

						Gary Walker passed an amendment he was carrying for Waste Control

						Specialists, one of two companies that had funded the lobby's

						rad-waste feeding frenzy this session. The Walker Amendment permitted

						private companies to hold a nuclear waste disposal license, a

						measure that Chisum warned would allow the Department of Energy

						to dispose of weapons waste in Texas. <br><br>

						The private license opened the door to D.O.E. waste &#151; more hazardous,

						less stable, and far far more voluminous than the electric utility,

						hospital, and industrial waste that Maine and Vermont will add

						to home-grown Texas nuclear waste destined for disposal in a Texas

						site yet to be determined. (Maine and Vermont have signed a federal

						compact, agreeing to dispose of their nuclear waste in Texas.)

						The Department of Energy &#151; known for its contaminated weapons

						testing and production facilities at Rocky Flats, Colorado, and

						Hanford, Washington &#151; is considering turning to the private sector

						to help dispose of waste that has accumulated for decades. And

						under federal law, a state cannot regulate the disposal of D.O.E.

						waste at a private facility opened for that specific purpose.

						After Chisum failed to stop the private license in early May,

						he warned, &#147;We may be in a situation where we're going to get

						D.O.E. waste and there's not anything we can do about it.&#148; <br><br>

						By mid-May in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee, Republican

						committee chair Buster Brown had seized Chisum's bill and made

						it even worse, using an unrelated sunset bill to kill the Low-Level

						Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, and providing additional

						guarantees that a private company will hold the rad-waste disposal

						license. On the floor of the Senate on May 21, as Speaker Clayton

						waited in the lobby, Brown began his presentation with the rad-waste

						lobbyists' mantra: &#147;The state of Texas has spent $53 million in

						a failed attempt to locate a nuclear waste site.&#148; The argument

						that inevitably follows holds that the slow, deliberate siting

						process has failed and it's time to move quickly to license and

						build a dump. <br><br>

						&#147;We're not alone,&#148; Brown continued, noting that Nebraska spent

						$96 million and failed, California spent $93 million and failed,

						and Illinois spent $88 million and failed. &#147;No new, traditional

						low-level radioactive waste disposal site has succeeded in getting

						a permit in the United States over the past twenty-five years,&#148;

						Brown said. <br><br>

						Assisted by a well-intentioned but ineffective challenge from

						Corpus Christi Senator Carlos Truan, Brown made the case for a

						two-track system that would pit the Texas Natural Resources Conservation

						Commission against &#147;a private entity&#148; in competition for a permit,

						or two permits, to dispose of radioactive waste in Texas. Under

						Brown's bill, the Texas Department of Health would probably end

						up holding the state license for the federal compact dump, in

						which electric utilities, industries, and hospitals will dispose

						of radioactive waste by burying it in trenches. The more lucrative

						(and far more hazardous) D.O.E. waste would end up in a dump operated

						by a private entity with a private license &#151; in this case Waste

						Control Specialists, which already operates a hazardous waste

						site in Andrews County, where elected officials from the county,

						city, and school district are working to attract a low-level radioactive

						waste dump.<br><br>

						&#147;All the sites failed,&#148; Brown said, referring to Nebraska, California,

						Illinois and Texas, &#147;because they have one factor in common. They

						were not wanted in that community. Texas has something of a unique

						situation. We have an area in Texas that wants the site. That

						area is Andrews County.&#148; (Brown didn't mention the problems with

						geology and hydrology the T.N.R.C.C. found at Sierra Blanca and

						at another proposed site in Andrews County.)<br><br>

						Brown continued, with what might be considered the public relations

						component of the bill he had reworked on behalf of Waste Control

						Specialists. Before any site can be approved in Texas:<br>

						<DD>- a public hearing must be held in the community designated for

						the dump;<br>

						<DD>- the county commissioners court must pass a resolution endorsing

						the project;<br>

						<DD>- the company must agree to spend 10 percent of its revenue locally;<br>

						<DD>- the company must agree to hire residents from the area in which

						the project is located.<br><br>

						Brown used Truan's clumsy questions about D.O.E waste to his advantage,

						arguing that the D.O.E. waste that a private license is certain

						to attract cannot be kept out of Texas because the Department

						of Energy has the right to dispose of waste in any state, despite

						the objections of state government. Then, in the same breath (and

						unchallenged), Brown volunteered that D.O.E. regulations prohibit

						the agency from disposing of radioactive waste in a state if the

						state government objects. Brown went on to use to his advantage

						an Austin American-Statesman article that Truan had brought in

						to use in an argument against the bill &#151; stopping short of taking

						the paper out of Truan's hand. &#147;Are you sure you read the article,

						Senator, or did someone tell you about it?&#148; Brown asked. <br><br>

						Floor debate in the Senate is most commonly used to make pronouncements

						to the public or establish legislative intent &#151; not to sway votes.

						When twenty-one votes are required to bring a bill to the floor,

						it's likely that the bill has the sixteen votes required to pass.

						In fairness to Truan, the most skilled, well-prepared, and agile

						debater in the Senate could not have stopped a bill being advanced

						by the largest team of lobbyists any private interests have set

						upon one single piece of legislation this session.<br><br>

						Brown's deal was done. Lubbock Republican Robert Duncan added

						an amendment that ensured the dumpsite will be located in Andrews

						County. El Paso Democrat Eliot Shapleigh failed in an attempt

						to keep the license in the state's hands, then succeeded in tossing

						in a stealth amendment that caught Brown by surprise &#151; prohibiting

						any Texas site from accepting D.O.E. waste created by the production

						of nuclear weapons. (Waste from weapons testing is already prohibited.

						In an interview on the floor just after passage of Brown's bill,

						when asked if his seemingly minor amendment might in fact eliminate

						all D.O.E. waste, Shapleigh said, &#147;We'll just have to see.&#148;) With

						only one environmental amendment encumbering its progress, Brown's

						bill easily passed the Senate. <br><br>

						There's a widely recognized distinction between Representative

						Warren Chisum and Senator Buster Brown. Chisum is a Republican

						conservative with great deal of personal integrity. Brown is a

						Republican conservative. When the bill left the House, carrying

						an industry amendment Chisum had denounced and failed to defeat

						on the floor, Chisum said he might prefer a dead bill to a bad

						bill. After Duncan added the Andrews County amendment, Chisum

						argued that the bill was not worth salvaging. <br><br>

						Three days before the session ended, Chisum ended the debate &#151;

						in a conference committee. &#147;I killed it,&#148; he said. &#147;I don't want

						Texas to become the dumping ground for the Department of Energy.&#148;

						Chisum added that Buster Brown's killing of the Low-Level Waste

						Authority was irresponsible: &#147;He did it in retaliation.&#148;<br><br>

						It was a small victory for the environmental lobby, which all

						along argued that the existing process was far better than a process

						that would open the state up to Department of Energy weapons waste.

						And a large victory for Billy Clayton. The Speaker was one of

						twelve lobbyists Envirocare had hired to derail Waste Control

						Specialists' plan to locate a radioactive waste dump in Andrews.

						Envirocare has a Texas site of its own &#151; off I-20 near Monahans.

						<br><br>

						&#147;They'll all be back next session,&#148; Chisum said. &#147;This is not

						over.&#148; </font></td>
