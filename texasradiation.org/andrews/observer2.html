<p><font size="4"><b>NUKE UNDEAD AWAKE.</b></font> Everyone knows you can&#146;t
keep a good man down. More perplexing

is the remarkable resilience of the ungood &#151; like former Texas

Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority executive director,

Rick Jacobi. Last fall, when the T.N.R.C.C. officially killed

the Sierra Blanca dump he had promoted for over a decade, Jacobi

was looking for a personal dump to hide in. But the vampire&#146;s

coffin had a silver lining &#151; Jacobi&#146;s Hudspeth County bungling

had boosted the Andrews County hopes of two private waste companies

(one of which, Envirocare of Texas, has re-incarnated Rick as

its new vice president of operations, effective February 8). Envirocare

head Norm Sunderland told Political Intelligence that Jacobi,

whose duties will include lobbying the Legislature, brings &#147;a

wealth of experience in low-level waste disposal in Texas.&#148; Indeed,

by our accounting, Jacobi&#146;s been at it for seventeen years &#151; and

over fifty million dollars &#151; although he hasn&#146;t disposed of anything

yet (other than the state agency he worked for). </p>

<dd>Jacobi
wasn&#146;t the only nuclear player traded in the legislative

off-season. Roy Coffee, formerly of the Governor&#146;s Office of State

and Federal Relations (where he helped lobby for federal passage

of the Texas-Maine-Vermont Waste Compact last year), has landed

a contract with Envirocare&#146;s competitor, Waste Control Specialists.

Meanwhile, Bruce Darling, the U.T. geology grad who worked on

the ill-fated Sierra Blanca license application, has been retained

as a consulting hydrologist for Envirocare. (Darling&#146;s unpublished

dissertation supported the Sierra Blanca site, which sat over

an aquifer; Western Andrews County, location of both private sites,

also sits above an aquifer formation, so Darling&#146;s dubious hydrology

remains in demand.) On the utility front, Eddie &#147;Munster&#148; Selig,

of the nuke industry front group Advocates for Responsible Disposal

in Texas, has kept his crack lobbying team intact. Formerly boosters

of Sierra Blanca (and therefore <i>de facto</i> opponents of privatization), the
pragmatic Advocates were recently

spotted in Andrews County touring both competing facilities.</p>

<dd>To head its
lobbying team, Envirocare has assembled an all-star

former Speaker squad, with both Billy Clayton and Gib Lewis on

board. The company&#146;s top attorney is Vinson &amp; Elkins&#146; Molly Cagle.

For sheer firepower, however, it&#146;s hard to beat the team put together

by Waste Control Specialist owners Kent Hance, Ken Bigham, and

Harold Simmons. Top flak Bill Miller, of the Austin P.R. firm

Hillco Partners (formerly MEM-Hubble), is the latest addition

to a team that includes former state senators Carl Parker, Bill

Sims, and Bill Haley, and former Bush aides Reggie Bashur and

Cliff Johnson.</p>

<dd>Johnson
actually represents the Andrews County Industrial Foundation,

the group that brought Waste Control Specialists to town four

years ago and has been the company&#146;s biggest booster. Members

of the Foundation recently traveled to Maryland, where they helped

Waste Control woo the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, which is considering

locating a new uranium enrichment facility on Waste Control&#146;s

current site, to be operated by both companies. Envirocare, which

has worked hard in the past to scuttle Waste Control&#146;s plans,

has gotten the cold shoulder from the Industrial Foundation (though

it is pushing ahead with the permitting process, despite being

several years behind W.C.S.).</p>

<dd>In the early
handicapping at the Lege, Waste Control seems to

have the inside track as well. Envirocare lobbyist Billy Clayton

has suggested that Pete Gallego&#146;s waste bill (H.B. 674) unfairly

favors Waste Control. This would come as no surprise, since according

to one insider, Waste Control actually wrote portions of the bill.
