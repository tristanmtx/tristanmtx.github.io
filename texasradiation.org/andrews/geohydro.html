    This JPG(38K) is a photo of a Andrews geologist pointing out a
    major recharge feature visible in the face of the WCS facility's pit wall
     known as a 'sand worm' or 'sand tube'.  This is where percolating, flowing waters
     have removed the organic matter from the clay over millions of years, leaving behind sand in a 
     tube form connecting the aquifers beneath to  the surface water collection 
     forms known as playa lakes.  Also known as 'buffalo wallows,' there are 19,500 playa lakes
     in the southern high plains of Texas that feed the enormous Ogallala aquifer 
     as well as the numerous minor aquifers. (see maps)

Andrews and other sites  in the region is medical wastes, although the graph
on the lower right indicates medical wastes comprise merely 0.3% volume of the wastes
handled by the dump sites in the 1995 report.

   See the WCS's <a href="license.html">license</a> for definitions of these classes.
     Class "A" comprises 96.7% of the waste in storage.

<DT><B><a href="OANewUNSUITABLE.html">Report indicates Andrews site may be unsuitable</a>
<DD> - UT study discloses presence of Ogallala aquifer in proposed nuclear waste site.
<DD> - March 17, 1999, Odessa American, by Greg Harman</b>
       
       
       <DD> - "A study released by the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology shows the
       geology of western Andrews County may be unsuitable for radioactive waste disposal.
       The report, released late last month and made public Tuesday, said the Ogallala aquifer is located
       beneath land owned by Envirocare of Texas and may also lie beneath Waste Control Specialists'
       hazardous and low-level radioactive storage facility.

       Concerned mainly with the possible location of underground water beneath the two sites, the report
       prepared by the bureau's research scientist, Alan Dutton, questions the methodology behind a recent
       report by Texas Tech University scientists, paid for by Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists.
<DD>
 "He states that Ogallala is absent at the WCS site," Dutton's report said. 
 "No scientific description or documentation were included with the text ... to substantiate these
       interpretations."
       
       <DD>
The report also states that "the description of core materials" at the WCS site
resemble those found at Envirocare's 888 acres, located eight miles southeast of
Envirocare's unimproved lands.   Wet core samples taken from the Envirocare of
Texas site reflect the presence of groundwater, the report said.  Core samples
taken from the WCS site for the company's 1993 application for radioactive waste
disposal also were wet."
