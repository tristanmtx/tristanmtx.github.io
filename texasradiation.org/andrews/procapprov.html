<B>Procedures for Approval to Dispose of Exempt Level of Radioactive and
Mixed Waste at the WCS Andrews Facility</B>
<BR>
<BR>
USDOE radioactive and mixed waste containing levels of radioactive material that
are considered exempt under Texas regulations, and that do not have to be shipped
as low-level radioactive waste can be disposed of at the Waste Control
Specialists (WCS) Andrews facility. This disposal is authorized under USDOE
directives that allow reclassification of certain radioactive and mixed waste as
residual material and unique regulatory authorities that exist in Texas.
<BR>
<BR>
USDOE Headquarters has issued two memoranda that address the issue of
reclassifying radioactive waste as residual material and approving disposal at
non-licensed facilities; Jan 7. 1997 re: Establishment and coordination of
authorized limits for release of hazardous waste containing residual radioactive
material; and Nov 17, 1995 re: Application of DOE 5400.5 requirements for release
and control of property containing residual radioactive material. These memoranda
are included as Attachment A.
<BR>
<BR>
Both memos contains similar procedures that allow DOE sites to ship waste
(hazardous and non-hazardous) containing low levels of radioactivity as residual
materials to unlicensed ofgite
disposal facilities after performing an ALARA analysis which shows that the
impacts will be
minimal. These procedures are as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>1. The authorized limits are selected and approved by DOE based on an ALARA
assessment
that insures that individual doses to the public are less than 25 mrem per year
with a goal of a
few millirem per year or less. If it can be shown that the maximum individual
dose is less
than 1 mrem per year with a collective dose of less 10 person-rem per year, then
DOE Field
Office managers can authorize disposal without EH-1 written approval.
<DD>2. The authorized limits ensure that groundwater will be protected consistent
with state
requirements.
<DD>3. The authorized limits are assessed to ensure that release of the disposal
facility property
would not be expected to require remediation under DOE 5400.5 or other applicable
requirements.

<DD> 4. The activities are coordinated with and acceptable to the disposal
facility operator and
appropriate state regulators.

<P>
DOE radioactive and mixed waste which is less than exempt levels and which can be
reclassified as residual material can be disposed of at the WCS Andrews facility
because of the following unique regulatory authority that exists in Texas. The
Texas Health Department (TDH) regulates possession and use of radioactive
material and treatment and storage of radioactive waste, while the Texas Natural
Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) regulates disposal of radioactive
waste. In a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two agencies, if the
Health Department has exempted a radioactive material from licensing requirements
under its regulations, then the waste can be disposed of without regard to its
radioactive properties under TNRCC authority. Since WCS has this authority to
dispose of radioactive material and solid waste under its RCRA permit, a variety
of low activity exempted materials can be disposed of at the Andrews facility. 
See the WCS Waste Acceptance Criteria Section 3.2
(Attachment B)
 for details on these exempt levels.

The WCS Andrews facility can meet each of the above criteria for all DOE mixed
and radioactive waste containing radioactive materials that are below exempt
levels under Texas regulations. A description of how the WCS facility meets each
of these criteria follows. 
<BR><BR>
1. The safety analysis, RESRAD and TSD calculations, included as Attachment D,
demonstrates that the Andrews can meet the 1 mrem/yr criteria for exempt level
waste.

<BR><BR>
2. The facility description (Attachment C) 
provides adequate discussion to show that groundwater at the site will be
protected consistent with state requirements. The fact that the facility has a
RCRA disposal permit issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
(TNRCC) and a TSCA disposal permit issued by USEPA is further evidence that the
facility meets these criteria.

<BR><BR>
3. Since the material would meet exempt levels, it could be disposed of without
regard to its radioactivity. The RCRA closure and post closure requirements under
the RCRA permit would further assure that future remediation would not be
required. The various financial assurance instruments required by the radioactive
material license and RCRA permit will provide additional protection.

<BR><BR>
4. The TDH, Bureau of Radiation Control has indicated that WCS can dispose of
exempt level DOE waste if notification is provided of the quantities received and
certification of DOE reclassification as residual materials. Our RCRA permit
authorizes us to dispose of radioactive materials and TNRCC has provided written
authorization that WCS can dispose of exempt level material.
<BR><BR>
In June 1998, WCS was awarded a significant portion of the DOE Broad Spectrum
Contract. All DOE facilities can utilize this contract vehicle (through
Bechtel-Jacobs at ORNL) to ship the following generic waste streams to the WCS
Andrews facility for treatment, storage and possible disposal. Since WCS has most
of the necessary permits and licenses currently in place, we anticipate that
selected waste streams can be shipped as early as September 1998.
<BR><BR>
- Treatment Category C: Non-TSCA. RCRA hazardous Waste with Metals and
Insignificant Organics Requiring Treatment Primarily for Metals Only.
<BR><BR>
- Treatment Category E: TSCA-Only Waste with Organics WCS is in the process of
negotiating inclusion of additional services, including disposal and treatment of
other categories of waste strearns that will require stabilization (Category C)
and decontamination (Category E). Since WCS can dispose of exempt level materials
after DOE facilities have reclassified the waste as residual materials,
significant quantities of DOE mixed could be disposed at WCS after treatment
under the Broad Spectrum Contract. If disposal cannot be included as part of the
Broad Spectrum Contract, it could be done under a separate contract.
<BR><BR>
It is believed that the attached information and analyses will provide sufficient
justification for DOE site managers to approve the reclassification as residual
material and disposal at WCS of all DOE radioactive and mixed waste that meets
the WCS WAC disposal requirements. You can contact William P. Dornsife, WCS Yice
President-Nuclear Affairs at 717-540-5220 (E-mail: dornsife.william@MCI9000.com)
