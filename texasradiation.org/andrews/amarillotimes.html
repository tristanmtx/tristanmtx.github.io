AUSTIN - A highly criticized measure to establish the permanent management 
of low-level radioactive waste in Texas passed a Senate panel Tuesday with 
an amendment the bill's author says could keep it from becoming law.
<BR><BR>
Senate Bill 1541 from Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, calls upon the state to 
meet its obligation agreement under a federal compact with Maine and Vermont 
to establish such a facility. The original version of the bill made the site 
exclusive to waste generated by the three states, but it included provisions 
to expand the site if deemed necessary by the federal compact commission.
<BR><BR>
Minutes after Duncan offered a substitute to the bill that removed the 
expansion provision, fellow Senate natural resources committee member Teel 
Bivins, R-Amarillo, offered an amendment to create a second site for 
Department of Energy waste, providing a spot for the waste environmental 
activists warned against.
<BR><BR>
Duncan voted against the amendment.
<BR><BR>
Bivins said the compact site alone wouldn't be financially viable, and he 
was representing the interests of his constituents in Andrews County - who 
say they want the facility - when he brought the DOE site amendment to the 
committee.
<BR><BR>
Bivins said the expense to operate the site would be enormous, and the 
amount of waste generated by compact states wouldn't be enough to justify 
the expense. However, he said, the state does need to open a compact site.
<BR><BR>
"The way to, in my mind, make the project economically viable is to allow 
the limited importation of low-level radioactive waste generated by the 
federal government," Bivins said, adding that the project would generate 
compact money to the "host" county, job creation and an improved tax base.
<BR><BR>
Duncan said he is concerned Bivins' amendment does too much too fast.
<BR><BR>
"I think the amendment causes some problems in getting the bill passed. I 
think we need to be very careful and move incrementally in the permanent 
management and disposal of low-level waste," he said. "I don't agree with 
Senator Bivins that it is necessary to take federal waste in order to make a 
compact site economically feasible."
<BR><BR>
Duncan said the rates paid to compact sites are high, and Texas as a state 
could make it work.
<BR><BR>
"The whole purpose for having a compact is to be able to control and limit 
the amount of waste coming into your state," Duncan said. "My sole interest 
in this has been to enact a compact site that is sound and well-regulated, 
and in order to do that, you need to do it incrementally - and this 
amendment, in my view, will not accomplish that."
<BR><BR>
The amendment will subject the bill to criticism that - true or not - could 
affect passage of the bill, Duncan said.
<BR><BR>
Erin Rogers, grass-roots coordinator for the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra 
Club, promises an "all-out war" over the amended version of the bill.
<BR><BR>
She said Bivins' amendment is a blatant attempt to give Waste Control 
Specialists, a company with interests in Andrews, access to the more 
financially lucrative disposal of federal waste.
<BR><BR>
Bivins said Andrews leaders have been working with the company, and he 
anticipates the company will apply for the contract.
<BR><BR>
However, he said, no one else is prohibited from applying for the contract.
<BR><BR>
Duncan's bill for the compact site maintains state holding of the waste and 
the land. The private company contracted to manage the site is paid through 
fees collected from those whose waste is taken - much of which comes from 
medical research in the state.
<BR><BR>
Bivins' proposal site - to be located a quarter-mile from the compact site - 
would take federal waste and the federal government would control the site. 
The waste would pose no more risk to people or the environment than the 
low-level waste at the compact site, he said.
<BR><BR>
"What they just did gives away state control of that site," Rogers said. "I 
think this is extremely dangerous, turns Texas into a national dumping 
ground, voluntarily gives away control that the state would've had over this 
site, and is horrible policy," she said.
