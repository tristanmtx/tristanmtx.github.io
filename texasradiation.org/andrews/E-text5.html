<P><B>HIGH PLAINS AQUIFER</B></P>

<P>INTRODUCTION</P>

<P>The High Plains aquifer in Oklahoma and Texas is part of a regional aquifer
that extends into parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, South
Dakota, and Wyoming (<A HREF="E038-Ogallala1.pdf">fig. 38</A>). Only that part
of the aquifer in Oklahoma and Texas is described in this chapter; descriptions
for other States are in other chapters of this Atlas. The aquifer consists
predominantly of the Ogallala Formation of late Tertiary age; locally, unconsolidated
deposits of Quaternary age are included in the aquifer. In places, the High
Plains aquifer is in hydraulic connection with permeable parts of the underlying
bedrock, which ranges in age from Permian to Cretaceous.</P>

<P>The High Plains geographic area is in the Great Plains Physiographic
Province and consists of an&nbsp;elevated plain that is relatively undissected.
The population of the High Plains geographic area is sparse, but the combination
of level topography, excellent soils, and an abundant supply of ground water
for irrigation makes this an important agricultural region.</P>

<P>Average annual precipitation ranges from about 12 inches in the southwest
to 24 inches in the northeast. Average annual runoff ranges from about 0.2
inch in the west to 0.5 inch in the east. The High Plains aquifer in Segment
4 underlies an area of about 43,000 square miles mostly in the panhandle
parts of Oklahoma and Texas. About 4.5 billion gallons of water per day
was withdrawn from the High Plains aquifer in Oklahoma and Texas during
1985. The aquifer is by far the most intensively developed aquifer in the
two-State area.</P>

<P>HYDROGEOLOGY</P>

<P>The High Plains aquifer described in this chapter has been called the
Ogallala aquifer in many published reports. The age of the Ogallala Formation
is considered to be Miocene in this chapter, but is listed as Pliocene or
Pliocene and Miocene in many published reports.</P>

<P>At the close of deposition of the Ogallala Formation several million
years ago, the Great Plains was a vast, gently sloping plain that extended
from the edge of the Rocky Mountains eastward for hundreds of miles. Regional
uplift and erosion stripped away the plain in many places, but a large central
area was little affected by eroding streams and is preserved. This preserved
remnant of the uplifted Ogallala Formation is known as the High Plains.
Although the surface of the High Plains has been modified little by streams,
it has been pitted by carbonate dissolution and deflation, thus forming
many playas, or shallow depressions, that collect and store water during
periods of precipitation and runoff.</P>

<P>The Canadian River has cut through much of the Ogallala Formation in
the Texas Panhandle. The High Plains south of the Canadian River is referred
to locally and regionally as the Southern High Plains. This area also is
known as the Llano Estacado (Staked Plain).</P>

<P>HYDROGEOLOGIC FRAMEWORK</P>

<P>During Miocene time, the uplifted and tectonically active Rocky Mountains
provided source material for deposition of the Ogallala Formation. Valleys
and basins that developed by erosion on the surface of Permian, Triassic,
Jurassic, and Cretaceous rocks (<A HREF="E039-Ogallala2.pdf">fig. 39</A>) became
filled with Ogallala sediments. In northern Texas, some collapse structures
in Permian rocks are filled with Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, or Cretaceous)
rocks, as well as with Ogallala deposits. Where the Mesozoic rocks have
secondary permeability, they are considered to be part of the High Plains
aquifer; however, they are a very minor component. The Ogallala sediments
were deposited by braided streams that spread across a generally level plain.
The eastward-flowing streams deposited a heterogeneous mixture of gravel,
sand, silt, and clay.</P>

<P>Upwarping and climatic change in Pliocene time caused deposition of alluvium
to cease and erosion to begin. Preservation of the remnant of uplifted Ogallala
Formation that composes most of the High Plains aquifer is due largely to
the presence of resistant caliche cap rock that formed over much of the
surface of the Ogallala. The cap rock consists of zones that are cemented
with calcium carbonate; these zones are resistant to weathering and cause
the formation of ledges and escarpments.</P>

<P>The thickness of the Ogallala Formation is as much as 650 feet. The overlying
Quaternary alluvium and windblown sand, which are locally as much as 150
feet thick, are part of the High Plains aquifer in some places (<A HREF=
"E040-Ogallala3.pdf">fig. 40</A>). The base of the aquifer generally slopes to
the east and southeast. The altitude of the base ranges from about 2,000
to 4,000 feet above sea level (<A HREF="E041-Ogallala4.pdf">fig. 41</A>). The
altitude of the water table before development ranged from about 2,400 to
more than 4,000 feet above sea level (<A HREF="E042--Ogallala5.pdf">fig. 42</A>).
The regional movement of ground water is from west to east toward the cap-rock
escarpment that forms the eastern margin of the High Plains geographic area.</P>



<P>GROUND-WATER HYDRAULICS</P>

<P>The High Plains aquifer is recharged by the infiltration of precipitation
that falls directly on the aquifer. This recharge is estimated to range
from 0.024 inch per year in the Southern High Plains of Texas to 2.2 inches
per year in Texas County, Okla. and is about 0.1 percent and 12 percent
of average annual precipitation, respectively. Additional recharge may occur
when a part of the water that is pumped for irrigation infiltrates the soil
and returns to the water table. As much as 54 percent of irrigation pumpage
might be reentering the aquifer in Castro and Parmer Counties, Tex., whereas
only 20 percent of irrigation water applied in the Oklahoma Panhandle might
be returned to the High Plains aquifer.</P>

<P>Ground water discharges naturally through seeps and springs, primarily
along the eastern escarpment and the Canadian River. Most ground water is
discharged artificially through wells.</P>

<P>Hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the sediments that compose
the High Plains aquifer are important properties that control well yields
and resulting water-level depths and rates of water-level declines. The
areal distribution of hydraulic conductivity, as shown in <A HREF="E043-Ogallala6.pdf">figure
43</A>, was estimated from records collected by water well drillers. Values
range from less than 1 to 200 feet per day, and the range is 25 to 100 feet
per day for most of the aquifer. The average hydraulic conductivity for
the 35,450 square miles of High Plains aquifer in Texas is estimated to
be 65 feet per day; the average for the 7,350 square miles of the aquifer
in Oklahoma is estimated to be 61 feet per day.</P>

<P>Specific yield also was estimated from lithologic descriptions made by
drillers during the construction of water wells. The areal distribution
of specific yield is shown in <A HREF="E044-Ogallala7.pdf">figure 44</A>. Values
range from less than 1 to 30 percent; most of the area is in the 10 to 20
percent range. The estimated average specific yield for the High Plains
aquifer in Texas and Oklahoma is 15.6 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively.</P>

<P>GROUND-WATER QUALITY</P>

<P>Small concentrations of dissolved solids in ground water in the High
Plains aquifer indicate that the water either has had a short residence
time in the aquifer or has been in contact with relatively insoluble minerals,
or both. Larger concentrations indicate longer residence time, contact with
soluble minerals such as gypsum, anhydrite, and halite, or mixing with more
mineralized water from bedrock.</P>

<P>Water from the High Plains aquifer is used mostly for crop irrigation.
If leaching or drainage is adequate, then concentrations of dissolved solids
between 500 and 1,500 milligrams per liter in irrigation water are not likely
to be harmful to crops. Concentrations of individual chemical constituents,
such as sodium, also are important in determining the suitability of the
water for most uses. Excessive sodium concentrations, for example, can cause
chemical imbalances and can interfere with normal plant growth.</P>


<P>Most of the water in the High Plains aquifer has a dissolved-solids concentration
of less than 500 milligrams per liter (<A HREF="E045-Ogallala8.pdf">fig. 45</A>).
Concentrations exceed 500 milligrams per liter in water from a large part
of the Southern High Plains in Texas. In water from the southernmost part
of the aquifer in Texas, concentrations of dissolved solids exceed 1,000
milligrams per liter but are generally less than 3,000 milligrams per liter.
In this area, highly mineralized water in underlying Mesozoic rocks of marine
origin probably moves into the High Plains aquifer in response to hydraulic-head
differences. Locally, the more mineralized water seems to be associated
with several alkali lake basins in areas underlain by Cretaceous rocks in
Lamb, Hockley, Terry, Lynn, eastern Gaines, and Martin Counties. Sodium
and increased dissolved-solids concentrations may increase locally because
of industrial activities and irrigation practices.</P>

<P>GROUND-WATER DEVELOPMENT</P>

<P>Pumpage of ground water for irrigation on the High Plains began in the
early 1900's and increased slowly until the mid-1940's. In Texas, the acreage
irrigated by ground water increased rapidly between the mid-1940's and 1959
but increased little between 1959 and 1980. The irrigated acreage in 1980
on the High Plains of Texas was 3.9 million acres, which was about the 1959
level. This leveling off after 1959 is primarily the result of declining
water availability in the Southern High Plains. Acreage irrigated by ground
water in the Oklahoma part of the High Plains in 1980 was about 389,000
acres. During the 1980 growing season, an estimated 5,169,000 acre-feet
of water was pumped from the High Plains aquifer for irrigation in Texas,
and an estimated 540,000 acre-feet was pumped in Oklahoma.</P>

<P>The density of acreage that was irrigated by ground water from the High
Plains aquifer during 1978 is shown in <A HREF="E046-Ogallala9.pdf">figure 46</A>.
Most of the irrigated acreage was in the northern one-half of the Southern
High Plains of Texas. In Texas alone, the High Plains aquifer supplied water
to about 75,000 irrigation wells.</P>

<P>Because pumpage to satisfy the large demand for crop irrigation has been
considerably in excess of recharge, water levels in the High Plains aquifer
have declined substantially. The altitude of the water table in the High
Plains aquifer in 1980 is shown in <A HREF="E047-Ogallala10.pdf">figure 47</A>.
When compared with the predevelopment water table (<A HREF="E042--Ogallala5.pdf">fig.
42</A>), the general westward shift of the contours indicates water-level
declines.</P>

<P>The change between the predevelopment and the 1980 water tables is shown
in <A HREF="E048-Ogallala11.pdf">figure 48</A>. Water-level declines of 50 to more
than 100 feet have been measured in a large area in the northern part of
the Southern High Plains of Texas where the irrigated acreage is most dense.
Water levels in most areas declined between 10 and 50 feet but rose in some
areas. Water-level rises in Texas probably resulted from the clearing of
native vegetation for cultivation, which increased the rate of recharge
from precipitation by reducing transpiration. Water-level rises in Oklahoma
probably represent a recovery from abnormally low water levels during the
drought of 1933-40. These low water levels were among the earliest data
available in Oklahoma and were used to construct the predevelopment water-table
map.</P>




<P>The general decline of the water table has resulted in a considerable
loss of water from storage and a decreased saturated thickness of the High
Plains aquifer. The total volume of drainable water in storage is a product
of specific yield, saturated thickness, and area. In 1980, the estimated
total volume of drainable water in storage in the High Plains aquifer was
390 million acre-feet in Texas and 114 million acre-feet in Oklahoma. The
saturated thickness of the aquifer ranged from 0 to 600 feet in 1980 (<A
HREF="E049Ogallala12.pdf">fig. 49</A>). The saturated deposits generally thicken
from south to north. Most of the aquifer south of the Canadian River had
a saturated thickness of less than 100 feet.</P>

<P>Changes in saturated thickness and in well yields are directly related.
The saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer in Texas reportedly decreased
by more than 50 percent in large parts of Castro, Crosby, Floyd, Hale, Lubbock,
Parmer, and Swisher Counties, south of the Canadian River. From 1958 to
1980, irrigated land in the seven counties decreased from 2.5 million to
1.9 million acres, while the number of irrigation wells increased from about
21,000 to 30,000. The average number of acres irrigated per well decreased
from 118 in 1958 to 62 in 1980. Decreased well yields are one result of
water-level declines.</P>

<P>Another result of water-level declines and decreased saturated thickness
is an increase in the depth to water. The generalized depth to water in
the High Plains aquifer in 1980 is shown in <A HREF="E050Ogallala13.pdf">figure
50</A>. Depths ranged from 0 to 400 feet and exceeded 100 feet for most
of the area. Greatest depths to water are in the vicinity of the Canadian
River. Increased depths to water equate to increased pumping lifts which,
together with decreased well yields, add substantially to the cost of withdrawing
water from the High Plains aquifer.</P>

<P>FRESH GROUND-WATER WITHDRAWALS</P>

<P>Withdrawals of freshwater from the High Plains aquifer in Texas and Oklahoma
totaled 4,508 million gallons per day during 1985 (<A HREF="E051Ogallala14.pdf">fig.
51</A>). Agricultural purposes, the principal water use, required about
4,343 million gallons per day. About 93 million gallons per day was withdrawn
for public supply and about 9 million gallons per day was pumped for domestic
and commercial uses. Withdrawals for industrial, mining, and thermoelectric-power
uses were 63 million gallons per day.</P>

<P>POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT</P>

<P>The map of potential yields of wells completed in the High Plains aquifer
shown in <A HREF="E052Ogallala15.pdf">figure 52</A> is based on hydraulic conductivity
and the 1980 saturated thickness. In a large part of the area, especially
north of the Canadian River, well yields in excess of 750 gallons per minute
can be expected. One well capable of yielding 750 gallons per minute can
irrigate 160 acres and effectively operate a quarter-section (0.25 square-mile)
center-pivot irrigation system. Irrigation development is less favorable
in areas, such as a large part of the Southern High Plains of Texas, where
well yields are less than 250 gallons per minute. Areas with further declines
in water level (therefore declining well yields) may experience a decline
in irrigated acreage, as noted in the &quot;Ground-Water Development&quot;
section above for the seven-county area in Texas. In some areas, particularly
the southernmost area, irrigation development may be limited because of
large sodium or dissolved-solids concentrations (<A HREF="E045-Ogallala8.pdf">fig.
45</A>).</P>

<P>Because the High Plains aquifer is being pumped far in excess of recharge,
the ground water is a limited resource. Questions of major concern are:
How long will the ground-water resource last?; and How can the remaining
water be managed and used most efficiently? Among the factors that influence
further development of the High Plains aquifer are crop prices, energy and
other farm costs, droughts and surplus precipitation, conservation practices,
regulatory policies, and water-use technology improvements.</P>

<P>The Texas Department of Water Resources projects an increasing shortage
of water from the High Plains aquifer for future irrigation needs. Unless
an effective conservation program is implemented, it is estimated that the
irrigated acreage on the High Plains of Texas will be decreased by slightly
more than one-half of the present acreage by 2030. Water conservation methods
and secondary recovery of capillary water are among some of the alternatives
that are being explored to solve the water-supply problems in the High Plains
of Texas. To assist in that exploration, digital computer simulations have
been used to predict the possible effects of future ground-water pumpage
on the High Plains aquifer under various pumpage estimates and management
strategies.</P>
