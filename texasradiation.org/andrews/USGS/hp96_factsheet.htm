<DD>The High Plains aquifer underlies parts of eight states--Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming--that are one of the major agricultural regions in the world. The number of acres 
irrigated by ground water expanded rapidly after 1940 in this area: 1949--2.1 million acres; 1959--6.1&nbsp;million acres;
1969--9.0&nbsp;million acres; 1978--12.9 million acres; and 1980--13.7 million acres (Gutentag and others, 1984;
Thelin and Heimes, 1987). In 1990, about 95 percent of the water withdrawn from the High 
Plains aquifer, or 15.7 million acre-feet, was used for irrigation (Marilee Horn, U.S.
Geological Survey, written commun., 1996).</DD></P>

<P>
<DD>Water-level declines appeared in the High Plains aquifer soon after extensive ground-water irrigation
development began. By 1980, water levels in the High Plains aquifer in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and 
southwestern Kansas had declined more than 100 feet (Luckey and others, 1981). In response to these 
declines, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with numerous Federal, State, and local water resource 
agencies, began a ground-water monitoring program in 1988 to assess annual water-level change in the 
aquifer using water-level measurements from more than 7,000 wells. The water-level measurements used in this 
report were made in winter or early spring, when water levels generally represent nonpumping conditions.</DD></P>

<BR>
<H3><A NAME="WL8096">WATER-LEVEL CHANGES, 1980 to 1996</H3></A><P>

<DD>The pattern of water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer from 1980 to 1996 (fig. 1) is based on 
measurements from 5,429 wells (table 1). Areas with substantial water-level declines from predevelopment 
to 1980 in southwestern Kansas and northwestern Texas continued to decline from 1980 to 1996. 
Areas that had substantial water-level declines from predevelopment to 1980 in west-central Texas and southwestern
 Nebraska, however, had considerably slower rates of decline, or rising water levels, from 1980 to 1996 (table 2).</DD>

<DD>The water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer from 1980 to 1996 ranged from a decline of 88 
feet for a well in New Mexico to a rise of 48 feet for a well in Texas. The average 
area-weighted water level in the High Plains aquifer declined 2.8 feet from 1980 to 1996 compared 
to a decline of 9.9 feet from predevelopment to 1980 (table 2). Considering 1940 as the time of 
initial irrigation development in the High Plains region, the rate of water-level decline decreased 
from about 0.25 foot per year (1940 to 1980) to 0.18 foot per year (1980 to 1996). Although 
much of the reduction in the rate of water-level decline since 1980 can be attributed to an average 
area-weighted water-level rise of 1.6 feet (or 0.10 foot per year) in Nebraska, water-level changes 
from 1980 to 1996 for measured wells in Nebraska ranged from a decline of 25 feet to a rise of 26 feet.</DD></P>

<p>
<DD>Factors that contributed to the smaller rate of water-level decline since 1980 are: (1) a decrease in 
ground-water withdrawals from the High Plains aquifer for irrigation—fresh ground-
water withdrawals for irrigation were 18.0 million acre-feet in 1980 and 15.7 million 
acre-feet in 1990 (Thelin and Heimes, 1987; Marilee Horn, U.S. Geological Survey, written 
commun., 1996); (2) greater than normal precipitation--average annual precipitation from
1981-95 in the High Plains region was 21.10 inches or 1.29 inches greater than normal (table 3); 
(3) a decrease in irrigated acreage in areas with large potential rates of aquifer depletion, 
such as in the southern part of the High Plains aquifer; (4) use of more efficient irrigation 
technology, such as low pressure nozzles and drop tubes on center pivots (fig. 2); (5) improved 
farm management practices, including irrigation scheduling, reuse of irrigation return flow, and 
the conversion to alternative crops or crop varieties with smaller consumptive irrigation requirements; 
(6) local regulation of ground-water withdrawals for irrigation and development of irrigated land; 
and (7) economic considerations that have forced marginal land out of irrigated production.</DD></p>

<DD>The average area-weighted water level in the High Plains aquifer declined 0.49 foot from 1995 to 1996 
(table 2) based on measurements from 7,467 wells (table 1). The average area-weighted water-level change 
in the High Plains aquifer from 1995 to 1996 by State ranged from a rise of 0.74 foot in South Dakota to 
a decline of 1.44 feet in Texas (table 2).</DD></P> 

<P><DD>Water-level declines of at least 1 foot were common in eastern Nebraska, southwestern Kansas, eastern 
New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and northwestern Texas; water-level declines of more than 3 feet 
were observed in large areas of southwestern Kansas and the western part of the Texas Panhandle (fig. 3). 
Water-level rises of 1 to more than 3 feet commonly occurred in parts of northeastern Colorado, 
south-central Kansas, north-central and northwestern Nebraska, south-central South Dakota, and southeastern 
Wyoming (fig. 3).</DD>

<DD>The water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer result from an imbalance during the period between 
discharge, which is primarily ground-water withdrawals for irrigation, and recharge, which is primarily 
from precipitation. Fresh ground-water withdrawals during 1995 in the High Plains region by county ranged 
from less than 0.02 acre-foot per acre to more than 0.50 acre-foot per acre (fig. 4); more than 95 percent 
of these withdrawals were for irrigation. Ground-water withdrawals for irrigation are affected by climatic 
conditions, particularly precipitation, which can cause large variations in water requirements for a given 
year’s crops.</DD></P>

<DD>Changes in the saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer since predevelopment, calculated

As of 1996, the percentages of remaining predevelopment saturated thickness ranged from 72 percent 
in Texas to about 100 percent in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Water-level declines exceeded 
100 feet from predevelopment to 1980 (Luckey and others, 1981) and 40 feet from 1980 to 1996 (fig. 1) 
in parts of southwestern Kansas and northwestern Texas. The remaining saturated thickness in that
