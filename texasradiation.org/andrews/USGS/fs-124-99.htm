<H3><A NAME="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</H3><P>

<DD>The High Plains aquifer underlies one of the major agricultural regions in the world, including parts of eight States--Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.  In the area underlain by the High Plains aquifer (called the High Plains region in this report), the total number of acres irrigated with ground water expanded rapidly after 1940: 1949--2.1 million acres; 1959--6.1 million acres; 1969--9.0 million acres; and 1980--13.7 million acres (Gutentag and others, 1984; Thelin and Heimes, 1987).  In 1990, about 95 percent of the water withdrawn from the High Plains aquifer (about 15.7 million acre-feet) was used for irrigation (Marilee Horn, U.S.Geological Survey, written commun., 1996).</DD></P>

<P>
<DD>Water-level declines appeared in the High Plains aquifer soon after extensive ground-water irrigation development began. By 1980, water levels in the High Plains aquifer in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and southwestern Kansas had declined more than 100 feet (Luckey and others, 1981). In response to these declines, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with numerous Federal, State, and local water resource agencies, began a ground-water monitoring program in 1988 to assess annual water-level change in the aquifer using water-level measurements from more than 7,000 wells. The purpose of this report is to present (1) water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer from 1980 to 1997 and from 1996 to 1997, (2) the precipitation pattern in the High Plains region during 1996, and (3) estimated saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer in 1996-97.  The water-level measurements used in this report were collected in winter or early spring when irrigation wells were not pumping.  Map scale and density of water-level elevation data preclude showing small areas in the maps of water-level change and saturated thickness where the value may be more or less than indicated.</DD></P>

<BR>
<H3><A NAME="WL8097">WATER-LEVEL CHANGES, 1980 to 1997</H3></A><P>

<DD>The water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer result from an imbalance between discharge, the largest component of which is ground-water withdrawals for irrigation, and recharge, which is primarily from precipitation.  This imbalance began with large-scale development of the aquifer for irrigation.  Ground-water withdrawals for irrigation in a given year can be affected by climatic conditions, particularly precipitation, which can cause large variations in the amount of irrigation water needed to satisfy the water requirements for crops.</DD></p>
<p>
<DD>The pattern of water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer from 1980 to 1997 (fig. 1) is based on measurements from 5,233 wells (table 1).  A large area in the northern part of the southern High Plains in New Mexico and Texas with greater than 100 feet of water-level declines from predevelopment to 1980 (Luckey and other, 1981) has continued to decline, but at slower rates.  The average area-weighted rate of decline in this area from predevelopment to 1980 was 3.7 feet per year; the rate of decline in this area from 1980 to 1997 was 1.6 feet per year.  Areas with substantial water-level decline from predevelopment to 1980 in the southern part of the southern High Plains in Texas and in the southeastern part of the northern High Plains in Nebraska (Luckey and other, 1981) had considerably slower rates of decline, or rising water levels, from 1980 to 1997.</DD>

<DD>Ninety-nine percent of all water-level changes from 1980 to 1997 are within a rise of 32 feet and a decline of 60 feet.  The average area-weighted water level in the High Plains aquifer declined 2.7 feet from 1980 to 1997 compared to a decline of 9.9 feet from predevelopment to 1980 (table 2).  Assuming 1950 as the beginning of irrigation development in the High Plains region, the rate of water-level decline decreased from 0.33 foot per year (1950 to 1980) to 0.16 foot per year (1980 to 1997).</DD></P>

<P>
<DD>Factors that contributed to the smaller rate of water-level decline from 1980 to 1997 as compared to predevelopment to 1980 are: (1) a decrease in ground-water withdrawals from the High Plains aquifer for irrigation, and (2) greater than normal precipitation from 1980 to 1996.  Ground-water withdrawals for irrigation were 18.0 million acre-feet in 1980 and 15.7 million acre-feet in 1990 (Thelin and Heimes, 1987; Marilee Horn, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 1996).  Precipitation from 1981 to 1996 in the High Plains region averaged 21.2 inches per year, 1.4 inches per year more than normal (table 3).</DD></P>

<DD>Factors that may have caused a decrease in ground-water withdrawals, in addition to increased precipitation, include: (1) a decrease in irrigated acreage in areas with water-level declines and in areas with large potential rates of aquifer depletion; (2) use of more efficient irrigation technology, such as low-pressure nozzles and drop tubes on center pivots; (3) improved farm-management practices, including irrigation scheduling, reuse of irrigation return flow, the conversion to alternative crops or crop varieties with smaller consumptive irrigation requirements, and methods to retain soil moisture; (4) local regulation of ground-water withdrawals for irrigation and development of irrigated land; and (5) economic considerations, including declining or stable commodity prices, increased production costs (including energy and fertilizer costs), and various agricultural programs of the Federal government that encourage the transfer of marginal land out of irrigated production.</DD></P>

<H3><A NAME="Sat_thick">SATURATED THICKNESS, 1996-97</A></H3>


<BR><P>
<DD>A saturated-thickness map of the High Plains aquifer (fig. 4) was prepared by superimposing a 1996-97 water-table map over a map of the elevation of the base of the aquifer and contouring the elevation difference.  The 1996-97 water-table map was based on 10,085 measurements-49 stream elevations (March 1997) and 10,036 water-level elevations in wells (1,370 from 1996 and 8,666 from 1997).  A water level was used only if the land-surface elevation of the well had been determined; a 1996 water level was used only if the 1997 water level was not available for a given well.  Within aquifer areas where there were no 1996 or 1997 measurements, such as in the northern High Plains in northeastern Wyoming, parts of western Nebraska, and north of the South Platte River in northeastern Colorado, the 1980 saturated-thickness contours were used (Weeks and Gutentag, 1981).  Around the boundary of the aquifer, the contours were approximated.</DD></P>
<BR>
<P>
<DD>Saturated thickness in 1996-97 ranged from generally 0 at the boundary of the aquifer to more than 1,000 feet in west-central Nebraska.  The percentage of the area of the High Plains aquifer within each saturated thickness interval in 1980 (Gutentag and other, 1984) and in 1996-97 is summarized by state in table 4.  The tabulated results show that the area of the High Plains aquifer with less than 100 feet of saturated thickness increased from 46 percent in 1980 to 49 percent in 1996-97.</DD></P>
