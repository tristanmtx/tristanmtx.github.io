</B><BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>1.0	PURPOSE</B>
<BR><BR>
Waste Control Specialists, LLC (WCS) is the holder of Texas Department of Health,
Bureau of Radiation Control Radioactive Material License Number L04971 issued
November 3, 1997. This license authorizes, in part, the receipt and processing of
radioactive material received as waste and interim storage of radioactive material
received as waste. In anticipation of WCS applying for future amendments to their
radioactive materials license or acquiring other operating permits, additional pre-operational environmental monitoring is planned to establish background information to
accommodate these activities. The purpose of this document is to provide WCS the plan
for conducting this additional pre-operational and operational environmental monitoring.
<BR><BR>
This Plan is being developed in advance of potential 11e(2) and/or Low Level
Radioactive Waste (LLRW) management disposal operations. The protocols contained
in this plan are intended to augment and complement the existing monitoring being
performed by WCS in accordance with their storage and treatment license. Results
obtained from the monitoring contemplated in this plan will be integrated with existing
data to form a pre-operational environmental baseline against which the effectiveness of
future facility operations will be measured.
<BR><BR>
<B>2.0	DISPOSAL FACILITY SETTING</B>
<BR><BR>
The WCS facility is located adjacent to the Texas-New Mexico State line some 30 miles
west of Andrews, Texas in Andrews County. The site is comprised of approximately
1,338 acres on the north side of Highway 176 and is surrounded by another 15,000 acres
also owned and controlled by WCS. The closest community is Eunice, New Mexico, 6
miles to the west of the facility and the nearest residence is a ranch house owned by
WCS. No other residential areas are located within 3 miles of the 1,338-acre facility.
The closest industrial facility is the Wallach gravel and crushing facility approximately
one mile to the west of the WCS facility. The site location is shown on Figure 2.1.
<BR><BR>

The Andrews County setting is extremely arid, receiving less than 14 inches of average
annual rainfall with pan evaporation potential exceeding 63 inches annually.
Temperatures are characterized as hot in the summer and relatively mild to cool in the
winter. The annual mean temperature is 63&deg; F. The prevailing wind direction is from the
south and south east with occasional shifts to the southwest during the winter months.
<BR><BR>
The facility is situated near the southwestern edge of the Southern High Plains, a stable
geomorphic and relatively featureless landscape with very subtle topographic relief.
There are no surface waters, natural drainage features, major aquifers, wetlands, or food
crops within 3 miles of the facility. The WCS facility is underlain by the Triassic
Dockum group, a thick clay formation with large isolated lenses of silt and sand
deposited under alluvial conditions.
<BR><BR>
<B>3.0	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAM</B>
<BR><BR>
The WCS Facility's existing environmental monitoring program for the Andrews County
site consists of collecting samples and measuring concentrations of radionuclides in
groundwater, air, soil, vegetation and fauna, direct radiation, and physical properties of
specific environmental media. This existing program is designed to provide
environmental data to allow WCS staff to demonstrate that it meets effluent release
standards contained in the Facility's Material License No. L04971. This pre-
operational/operational monitoring program is intended to supplement and revise their
existing monitoring program and to establish background levels for the additional
parameters to be added under this plan. The environmental data gathered will be
evaluated for possible seasonal fluctuations and used as a baseline once future disposal
operations are licensed. The critical isotopes, which are to be monitored under the pre-
operational environmental monitoring program, for both 11e(2)/ LLRW monitoring are
shown in Table 3.1. These isotopes are important from an environmental prospective due
to factors such as their radiological half-life, mobility, radiotoxicity, and presence within
LLRW waste streams. The data generated under the pre-operational program will be
used to establish concentration setpoints for monitoring future site performance. The
operational monitoring program will be used to evaluate the potential health and
environmental impacts during operation of an 11e(2)/ LLRW disposal facility and any
possible long-term environmental impacts.

<BR><BR>

Pre-operational monitoring as discussed in the Plan will be initiated prior to submitting
any license application for LLRW disposal and will continue during the remaining pre-operational period. Operational monitoring will begin when waste is disposed, continue
through the operational period and ends when waste is no longer accepted and the facility
is closed. Although monitoring during each phase is related to the performance
objectives mandated by state and federal regulations, the emphasis, scope, and level of
monitoring will vary. The pre-operational monitoring program has been developed using
procedures and methods which will be incorporated into the operational monitoring
program so that data collected during each phase will be compatible.
<BR><BR>
<B>3.1	Environmental Monitoring Program Philosophy</B>
<BR><BR>
WCS presently operates the Andrews County facility in a manner to minimize the
potential for releases from the storage and treatment of radioactive waste. The projected
performance of the Andrews County site has undergone rigorous scrutiny by the State of
Texas in granting the facility's present materials license. Any proposed 1 le(2)/LLRW
disposal facility license amendment designed for radioactive material isolation also must
include a revised performance assessment based upon site characteristics, projected waste
volumes and activity, administrative controls imposed during disposal operations,
disposal cells and covers design, and the buffer zone. Operational monitoring results
allow regulatory agencies and the facility operator to verify disposal system performance.
After waste is disposed, the disposal system must still remain within regulatory
compliance.
<BR><BR>
Since the results of the environmental monitoring program are critical to understanding
the disposal system performance, the monitoring program must be designed to render
usable data upon which informed decision can be made. For example, the quantitative
threshold for facility performance must not be set so low that environmental monitoring
results which represent expected variations in sample media concentrations are viewed as
evidence of unexpected waste constituent migration. Rather, data trend analyses would
be performed and, if necessary, additional or expanded sampling undertaken to better
determine the significance of the monitoring results. Investigative and action levels
agreed to by the Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Radiation Control (TDH) would
guide stepwise response activities including corrective actions, if necessary. This plan
provides the analyses and statistical bases for carrying out these activities.
<BR><BR>
<B>3.2	Objectives of Pre-Operational Monitoring</B>
<BR><BR>
The principal objectives of a radiological pre-operational environmental monitoring
program are as follows:

<BR><BR>
<DD>(a) Obtain background or baseline data - background radiological data is used to
establish baseline data on the natural radiological constituents on the site. These
data are to be used to establish reference levels to measure any impact from future

facility operations. They will also provide the basis to establish levels of
measurement at which further investigations must be undertaken to determine if
radioactive materials have migrated from the site.

<BR><BR>
<DD>(b)	Provide records for regulatory review - the records of environmental data serve as

a regulatory record that may be used to assess the environmental impact and overall performance of the facility throughout its life cycle.
<BR><BR>
WCS and its subcontractors have collected and analyzed environmental monitoring data for both radiological and non-radiological parameters during the licensing (for storage and treatment only) and permitting phases. The WCS RCRA Part B Permit governs the non-radiological monitoring program. The data indicate that the Andrews County site can be successfully monitored, (i.e., Pre-existing radiological and non-radiological conditions at the site will not preclude the licensee from successfully conducting the required monitoring activities during the three phases of 11e(2)/LLRW disposal facility life; pre-operation, active operation and post-operation. The duration of pre-operational monitoring period is a minimum of one year).
<BR><BR>
<B>3.3 Objectives of Operational Monitoring</B>
<BR><BR>
The principal objectives of an operational environmental monitoring program are as follows
<BR><BR>


<DD>(a)	Demonstrate compliance with applicable environmental and radiation protection
standards - Analysis of samples from environmental media provides quantitative
evidence of meeting federal and state environmental and radiation protection standards. The monitoring system must be capable of providing early warning of
releases of radionuclides from the disposal site before they reach the site boundary. WCS will compare results obtained in this phase to levels detected in
the pre-operational phase to identify problems and initiate the appropriate
corrective action.


<BR><BR>


<DD>(b)	Obtain data on critical pathways. Monitoring data obtained from environmental
media provides information to perform calculations of potential doses, if any, to
the public and to evaluate overall facility performance in relation to radiological assessments presented in the license application.  Operational environmental
monitoring is designed to enable comparisons of site impacts to performance
objectives and to ensure environmental impacts are as low as reasonable
achievable (ALARA).

<BR><BR>


<DD>(c)	Provide records for regulatory review - The records of environmental data will
serve as a regulatory record throughout the lifecycle of the facility.

<BR><BR>

During facility operations, WCS staff will collect monitoring data in accordance with the

handled, packaged, and analyzed and results recorded in accordance with approved procedures. The environmental data gathered during the one-year pre-operational period will be evaluated to determine if revisions are necessary to the Investigation Levels (IL) and Action Levels (AL) that have been established for the operational phase. The values are discussed in Appendix A and the preliminary values are tabulated in Procedure EVPD7.
<BR><BR>
<B>4.0	ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM</B>
<BR><BR>
WCS senior management and operating personnel have extensive experience in hazardous and radioactive waste management disciplines. This experience is directly applicable to the safe and efficient operation of an 11e(2)/ LLRW disposal site. WCS will continue to provide and maintain expertise in health physics, environmental monitoring and analysis engineering; geotechnical sciences; regulatory compliance; management, administration, and data base management; quality assurance/ quality control; occupational health and safety; and heavy equipment maintenance and operation.
<BR><BR>
<B>4.1	Staffing and Chain of Authority</B>
<BR><BR>
Programmatic responsibility for pre-operational and operational environrnental
monitoring resides with the Vice President, Operations and General Manager. Vice
President, Operations and General Manager, is responsible for providing training for the
facility staff and implementation of all aspects of the environmental monitoring program.
Responsibility for technical adequacy of the environmental monitoring program resides
with the Vice President, Nuclear Affairs. The facility Radiation Safety Officer (RSO),
 who reports to the Vice President, Facility Manager, is responsible for implementing
sample collection, chain-of-custody to analytical laboratories and subsequent data
acquisition. The RSO will review the data and data trends.
<BR><BR>

The Vice President, Operations and General Manager makes supplemental resources and
assistance available from the corporate staff and contractor organizations as necessary for
quality assurance activities and technical support. For the most part, however, technical
resources necessary to manage and implement the environmental monitoring program are
dedicated to the WCS Andrews County facility. Figure 4.1 depicts the organization for
the WCS facility including the environmental monitoring staff.

<BR><BR>
Click <a href="orgchartpg7.jpg">here</a> for Fig 4.1 Andrews Site Organizational Chart
<BR><BR>


<B>4.2	Facilities and Equipment</B>
<BR><BR>

The Vice President Operations/ Facility Manager will ensure that the facility is equipped with the proper tools and equipment required to perform environmental monitoring, and that it is staffed with properly trained personnel to perform the required maintenance on equipment. Maintenance of facility equipment will be performed by WCS staffwho report to the Operations Manager. Broken or improperly functioning equipment will be returned to the appropriate vendor if timely repairs are beyond the staffs expertise. All
maintenance and repairs will be documented.



<BR><BR>

The purchase and maintenance of the facility's environmental monitoring equipment will
be the responsibility of the RSO, who will ensure that all monitoring equipment conforms
to specified requirements, is maintained and operated in accordance with approved
procedures. Monitoring equipment calibrations or repairs will be performed by qualified
on-site personnel or a vendor approved calibration/repair facility. Any on-site
calibrations will be performed in accordance with written and approved procedures.
<BR><BR>



<B>4.3	Training</B>
<BR><BR>
Key facility personnel, including the Vice President, Operations and General Manager,
Radiation Safety Officer, and Operations Manager have appropriate experience working
at facilities involving industrial hygiene and safety concerns for hazardous materials or
radioactive waste management. Minimum qualifications for these positions are
addressed under the Facility's QA program. Facility personnel receive periodic on-the-job training while performing their duties at the WCS site to guarantee that they are fully
qualified to perform their duties. Training begins as soon as new employees are hired,
and is an ongoing process that continues throughout the operation of the facility.
Training in most cases includes successful completion of tests related to required skills
before employees are allowed to perform a particular task.
<BR><BR>
WCS's basic training program does not differentiate levels of training based on
experience. Each new site employee, who will be involved with radioactive material
handling, undergoes basic radiation worker training. This training assumes that the
employee has no prior knowledge of radioactive waste management. Each employee,
whether a high school or college graduate, undergoes the same training. Beyond this
basic training program, each position at the facility has specific qualification
requirements.
<BR><BR>
The RSO, who reports to the Vice President Nuclear Affairs, is responsible for directing
training for personnel involved in radiological environmental monitoring. The Quality
Assurance Manager is responsible for providing quality assurance training for site
personnel involved in quality-related activities. The Vice President Operations/ Facility
Manager is responsible for ensuring that all facility personnel attain the proper training
specific to their responsibilities.
<BR><BR>
Effectiveness of the training and employees' understanding of theory and application will
be verified by re-qualification examinations administered by the RSO every two years.
Employees must achieve a passing score to continue participation in environmental
monitoring activities. Test scores, quality assurance sweillance, and employee feedback
will be used to gauge the overall effectiveness of the training program. The training
program's effectiveness is also evaluated during both radiological control and safety
audits and during regulatory compliance and management audits.

<BR><BR>


The facility's formal training program for this pre-operational/operational program will
be developed and approved by the RSO. All training will be documented and
incorporated as part of individual employee training files. Training topics will include
license and permit requirements, procedural compliance, quality assurance, and
environmental monitoring protocols.

<BR><BR>
<B>4.4	Quality Assurance Program</B>

<BR><BR>
The organizational structures for the Quality Assurance (QA) program is contained in the
WCS Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP). Functional responsibilities, lines of
communication within the individual organizations, and the interfaces with peer groups
for activities affecting quality are contained in the QAPP. The persons and organizations
performing quality assurance functions have sufficient authority and organizational
freedom to identify potential problems adverse to quality; to initiate, recommend, or
provide solutions; and to verify the implementation of the solutions.

<BR><BR>
The WCS QA Manual, the QA Procedures Manual, and the facility's Operating
Procedures contain the requirements for managing and controlling quality related
activities for the WCS facility. The QA Manual addresses the requirements recommended
by NRC NUREG-1293, Quality Assurance Guidance for Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Facility and follows the 18-criteria format of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B. The
controls provided by the QA program ensure that the systems, structures, components,
and activities meet facility design and performance objectives. The general aspects of
WCS's QA Program are discussed in Appendix B.
<BR><BR>
The QA Program has been developed and implemented to control activities affecting
quality to the extent consistent with their importance. Assurance of quality is typically
verified by checking and reviewing all work and materials (including site characterization
data and design input data) against prescribed quality standards, established scientific
data, and facility performance criteria. Conformance to drawings and specifications is
also verified by inspection of procured activities. The QAPP contains provisions for
planning, reviewing, and verifying that project activities meet applicable criteria and
standards. WCS applies controls to work activities and items based on their relative
importance with regard to public health and safety, environmental protection, reliability,
and project objectives.
<BR><BR>
QA program controls are established and implemented at the earliest time practical
consistent with the schedule for accomplishing the activities. The site management team
determines and identifies the extent to which the QA controls are to be applied to specific
items and activities.
<BR><BR>
For the pre-operational and operational monitoring program each analytical laboratory
utilized is required to submit documentation of its QA program and be audited on-site by
the QA Manager or his designee prior to procurement of services. Included in the QA




specifications are requirements for EPA verification, NIST traceability, and the necessity
to have quality control samples to determine the precision and accuracy of the monitoring
processes.
<BR><BR>
<B>4.5	Audits and Managerial Controls</B>
<BR><BR>
A comprehensive system of planned and periodic QA surveillance of the environmental
monitoring activities is implemented to verify compliance with the QA manual,
applicable QA plans, procedures, standards, policy statements, and instructions. The
WCS QA Manager is responsible for planning and implementing QA audits in
coordination with the Vice President Operations/ Facility Manager and the RSO. These
planned and scheduled audits are performed in accordance with written procedures,
plans, and checklists and continued at intervals appropriate to the importance of the
activity. The audit program includes provisions to determine the effectiveness of the QA
program in controlling the activities in accordance with applicable codes, standards, and
regulations.

<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.2 Sample Preparation</B>
<BR><BR>
<DD>a)	For Gross Alpha and Beta
<BR>
An aliquot of the ample is evaporated to dryness in a pre-weighed stainless steel
planchet. (in the case of soil or vegetation, the sample must be ashed by heat). The
sample now can be counted in a gas flow proportional counter.
<BR><BR>
<DD>b)	For Alpha Spectrometry
<BR>
An aliquot of the sample has chemistry performed on it such that the solution can
be electro-deposited on a small stainless steel planchet. The sample now can be
counted in an alpha spectrometer.
<BR><BR>
<DD>c)	For Gamma Spectrometry
<BR>
A known weight of sample (i.e., soil) is placed into a container (usually a
Marinelli beaker) and then placed into the spectrometer for analysis. For water,
the sample is placed in a one gallon cubitainer and a small quantity of acid is
added. The sample is then placed into the gamma spectrometer
<BR><BR>


<DD>d)	For Low Energy Beta Counting (i.e., H<sup>3</sup> or C<sup>14</sup>)
<BR>
The sample is distilled and a small amount is then mixed with solvents and a
liquid compound that emits light when exposed to radiation. The sample is then
counted in a liquid scintillation counter.
<BR><BR>
<DD>e)	For Uranium Fluorometry
<BR>
An aliquot of sample is placed on a platinum dish, evaporated to dryness, and
ashed at high temperature. After cooling, a pellet of fluorescent material is placed
on the platinum dish and heated until the pellet melts and has no bubbles. Once
the dish has cooled, it is placed into the fluorometer for counting.
<BR><BR>
<B>5.2.3 Sample Measurement Techniques</B>
<BR><BR>
<DD>a)	Gas Flow Proportional Counters
<BR>
Gas flow counters work by flowing a gas over the sample and counting the pulses
collected from the electrode in the counting chamber.
<BR><BR>
<DD>b)	Alpha Spectroscopy Systems
<BR>
Alpha spectrometers work by using a semiconductor material coated with an
extremely thin gold foil. It is biased with a voltage to form a region that will
collect ions created in the semiconductor material. Computer analysis of the
spectral peaks results in the determination of activity.
<BR><BR>
<DD>c)	Gamma Spectroscopy Systems
<BR>
Similar to alpha spectrometers, gamma spectrometers also use a semiconductor
material. However, a thin aluminum sheath covers them since gamma rays can
easily traverse through air and thin materials. Computer analysis of the spectral
peaks results in the determination of the photon energy activity of radionuclide
present.
<BR><BR>
<DD>d)	Liquid Scintillation Counters
<BR>
For low energy beta radiation, liquid scintillation is the best choice. The sample
is physically mixed with a scintillation fluid that will fluoresce when it absorbs
radiation. The fluorescence is counted to determine the activity of the sample.
<BR><BR>
<DD>e)	Fluorometry Systems
<BR>
The sample is illuminated with a high energy light source such that the material in
the sample will fluoresce and the light output is read as a percentage.



<BR><BR>


<B>5.3	Determining Baseline Mean Values</B>
<BR><BR>
During the pre-operational phase of the facility the receipt of timely analytical results is
not as critical as during operations. However, it is appropriate to employ the same
counting methods as for the operational phase of monitoring for determining baseline
mean values for background environmental radioactivity and for excluding components
which are not present at the site. These analyses would include the primary radionuclides
expected to be present within the source term for the 11e(2)/ LLRW disposal facility at
Andrews County. Additionally, analyses will be performed for other radionuclides that
may be part of a future source term.
<BR><BR>
Since existing laboratory analytical methods can generally detect radioactivity below
those levels found in the environment, such methods are appropriate when seeking to
perform pre-operational monitoring for a site. However, the data review will consider the
fact that at low background concentrations, minute variations in background
concentrations have the potential to statistically affect analytical results.
<BR><BR>
Very low concentrations of radioactivity can be analyzed only through rigorously
controlled, delicate, and time-consuming methods. This limits the number of laboratories
able to provide such services.
<BR><BR>
<B>5.3.1 Determining Lower Limit of Detection Values</B>
<BR><BR>
With baseline mean values established using results from the 11e(2)/LLRW pre-operational environmental monitoring program, establishing LLDs for the operational
environmental monitoring phase of the facility is the next task. Considerations for
establishing these LLDs include the timeliness in receiving the results from the
laboratory, relevance of the values to regulatory limits, and the degree to which it is
necessary to track any changes in background radioactivity concentrations.
<BR><BR>
Thus, there must be a judgement as to which method yields the necessary information for
assessing site performance in a timely fashion. Establishing LLDs and the corresponding
investigation levels at levels that are too low presents the problem of frequent
investigations of inconsequential trends. Establishing LLDs that are too high presents the
problem of not having an adequate safety margin between the LLDs and regulatory
limits. LLDs must therefore be set at practical levels to obtain the optimum level of
utility and safety. Appendix A to this Plan contains additional information pertaining to
the task of setting acceptable LLDs for the environmental monitoring programs. The
apriori LLD's are presented in tables included with Procedure EV-PD7.

<BR><BR>
<B>5.4 Description of Pre-operational Program</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>5.4.1 Air Sampling</B>
<BR>Six sampling locations were chosen based on the general wind direction. A
meteorological station is used to verify that the wind rose used to locate the air samplers
is appropriate. Air sampling stations 32-7 and 36-11 to the west of the proposed
11e(2)/ LLRW site will serve as the upwind stations. A sampling location near the city of
Andrews, Texas will serve as the background location.
<BR><BR>
WCS staff will collect particulate samples from air drawn through filter paper mounted
within the six fixed air samplers. The air particulate samples will be taken continuously
to achieve weekly volumes of approximately 571 m<sup>3</sup> and a monthly composite total of
approximately 2447 m<sup>3</sup>. The particulate will be analyzed for the constituents listed in
Procedure EV-PD7. Additionally, Radon-222 will be measured using radon track etch
detectors situated at each of the process area air sampling stations. The background
location in Andrews also will include a track etch detector.
<BR><BR>
<B>5.4.2 Groundwater</B>
<BR>
Wells 6B1, 6B2, 11D, 2G, 7G, and the service water well form the network of upgradient
wells for the proposed 11e(2)/ LLRW disposal trench to be located within the existing
licensed WCS facility. Wells A-16, A-22, and A-24 will be used as downgradient wells.
Sampling will occur at each of these on-site wells at quarterly intervals. <I>Livestock Water
Source as off-site sample within 2 Km of proposed 11(e)2/ LLRW Site.</I> Since the yields of
some of the wells on the WCS facility do not allow sufficient water to be extracted during
a sampling event for a complete analysis or for a duplicate/split sample, the RSO may
specify that a sampling event be extended to allow a well to recover. Samples will be
analyzed for the constituents listed in Procedure EV-PD7.
<BR><BR>
<B>5.4.3 Surface Soil</B><BR>
Samples will be collected monthly near the five air sample stations during the pre-operational phase. Additionally, sarnples will be taken at two locations along the upwind
southern perimeter of the 1,338 acre licensed area and other points designated by the
RSO. These samples will be composited and submitted quarterly for analysis. Archive
samples also will be taken on a quarterly basis for the pre-operational period, which is
expected to last up to two years. Should the pre-operational period be shorter there will
be sufficient sample volume to assure an adequate number of analysis for determining
baseline levels. These archive samples will be held for possible future analysis. Soil
samples will be analyzed for the constituents listed in Procedure EV-PD7.
Also, soil samples will taken one time at 50-meter grid locations on the proposed
11e(2)/ LLRW site.
<BR><BR>


<B>5.4.4 Vegetation</B><BR>
While a human consumption pathway for vegetation has not been identified, monitoring
of site vegetation will continue to be performed to gather additional data concerning the
natural radioactivity in local vegetation. Samples will be collected semi-annually near
the five air sample stations and the two southern site border locations during the
beginning and end of the growing season. Vegetation samples will be analyzed for the
constituents listed in Procedure EV-PD7.
<BR><BR>
<B>5.4.5 Ambient Gamma</B>
<BR>
<DD>a) TLD Measurements Plan
<BR><BR>
Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) will be used to measure ambient gamma
exposure during the 11e(2)/ LLRW pre-operational environmental monitoring
phase. The TLDs will be located at intervals along the site perimeter fence and at
locations specified by the RSO that correspond to TDH TLD locations. A TLD
also will be located in Andrews, Texas for background control. The TLDs will be
collected and processed on a quarterly basis. Comparisons will be made between
the site and the background TLDs to identify any differences in background
during the pre-operational monitoring program.
<BR><BR>
A set of TLDs will also be placed at 50-meter grid intervals over the proposed
11e(2)/ LLRW sites, at one meter above the ground and then removed after 90
days. After these TLDs are removed another set of TLDs will be placed at 150-
meter intervals to 1500 meters in eight directions from the center of the site and
placed one meter above the ground. This group of TLDs will also be removed
and shipped to be read after 90 days.
<BR><BR>
A set of control TLDs will be included whenever badges are shipped to or from
the site. These TLDs will be processed along with the field TLDs in order to
verify that they did not receive an appreciable exposure while in transit. TLD
field exposures will be determined by reducing the calibrated reading from the
field cycle dosimeters by the background, transit dose indicated by the transit
controls, and the TLD background (self-dosing component) as determined from
control TLDs retained in a lead shielded storage cask. In conformance with ANSI
N545-1975, WCS will retain a lead cask at a control station at the WCS facility
for purposes of measuring the self-dosing component.
<BR><BR>
A blind testing QA program will be used. Periodically, per the RSO's
instructions, at least four TLDs will be sent to an offsite irradiation facility and
exposed to known doses of CS-137. The irradiated TLDs will be sent to the
dosimetry processor along with the TLDs exposed in the field.
<BR><BR>


<B>6.0	OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAM</B>
<BR><BR>
The operational environmental monitoring program will monitor site performance and
verify that the facility is in compliance with any license amendment issued for disposal of
11e(2)/ LLRW. The parameters to be monitored during the operational phase are chosen
for their ability to yield timely results. The use of indicator parameters as screening
indicators is an effective means to monitor the radiological impact of facility operations.
These parameters are a more timely and cost-effective means of monitoring facility
performance than full spectrum analyses. However, follow up investigations (including
re-sampling and extensive isotopic analysis) will be performed when required.
<BR><BR>
The sampling program for the operational phase is similar to that used for the pre-
operational phase except that operational monitoring includes a reduced periodicity for
sampling, less complex analysis, and relies on indicator parameters to allow timely
analysis of potential releases.
<BR><BR>
A tabulation of the parametric measurements to be used during the facility's operation
phase is included in Procedure EV-PD7 and a general discussion of the media to be
sampled and frequency of analysis is in the following section:
<BR><BR>
<B>6.1	Description of Operational Program</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>6.1.1 Air Sampling</B><BR>
The sample locations, frequency, and sampling methodology will be similar to those used
in the pre-operationai phase. However, laboratory analyses will be reduced from those
listed in Table 5.1 as follows:

<DD> - Alpha isotopic only if IL exceeded for gross alpha;
<BR>
<DD> - Sr-90 only if IL exceeded for gross beta;
<BR>
<DD> - C-14/ H-3 only after receipt of waste containing these isotopes.
<BR><BR>
<B>6.1.2 Groundwater</B><BR>
The sample locations, frequency, and sampling methodology will be identical to those
used in the pre-operational phase. However, laboratory analyses also will be reduced
from those listed in Table 5.1 as noted in Section 6.1.1.
<BR><BR>
<B>6.1.3 Surface Soil</B><BR>
The surface soil monitoring program will be scaled back to sample quarterly only those
locations used for air monitoring. The sampling methodology will be identical to that
used in the pre-operational phase. However, laboratory analyses also will be reduced
from those listed in Table 5.1 as noted in Section 6.1.1.

<BR><BR>

<B>6.1.4 Vegetation</B><BR>
The sample locations, frequency, and sampling methodology will be identical to those
used in the pre-operational phase. However, laboratory analyses will also be reduced
from those listed in Table 5.1 as noted in Section 6.1.1.
<BR><BR>
<B>6.1.5 Ambient Gamma</B>
<BR><BR>
<DD>a)	TLD Measurements Plan
<BR>
The TLD measurement plan is identical to the pre-operational phase except for
the one time TLD measurements.
<BR><BR>
<DD>b)	Survey Meter Mapping Plan
<BR>
During site operation a micro-R survey will be performed over each trench after it
has been filled and capped. The same general grid system used during the pre-
operational phase will be used to guide the surveyors with the frequency reduced
to an approximate 10 m grid. Each 10 m grid line will be surveyed with a NaI
meter at approximately 1 meter above the ground. The highest exposure rate
measured within a grid (i.e., 10 m in length) will be recorded. Results from this
mapping will be used for evaluating future trench cap stability and for locating the
presence of radionuclides in the operational area.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.0	DATA ANALYSIS AND TWO-TIERED RESPONSE SYSTEM</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>7.1	Routine Data Analysis</B>
<BR><BR>
WCS is committed to reviewing all environmental data and implementing an appropriate
response to the environmental monitoring results. Data reviews and responses are a two-
tiered process. First, data is checked in accordance with QA procedures and if deemed
acceptable entered into the database for incorporation into ongoing trend analyses.
Should results be questioned because of possible errors in the sampling or sample
analysis process then any discrepancies are to be resolved prior to data acceptance.
Secondly, corrective action is taken, if necessary, in response to elevated values of
environmental monitoring data. Trend analyses are begun when sufficient data is
available to support a statistical review. Trends are plotted to provide evidence of a
possible release of constituents from the disposal area. The sample results for each
location will be plotted to observe trends.
<BR><BR>
WCS will verify the validity of all environmental sample results, as they become
available. Verifying sample results is necessary to ensure that the results are accurate as
reported. This verification may include recalculation of results, comparison to results
from replicate samples sent to other laboratories, review of quality control used for
sampling, analysis and calculations, and comparison to other parametric analyses. An evaluation of a sample result's significance will normally take place after verifying its validity. However, in the event such a sample exceeds an action level or approaches a regulatory limit, evaluation and verification may be performed concurrently. In all cases, when a sample result exceeds an action level, TDH will be notified immediately so that a corrective action can be planned should the sample result prove valid.
<BR><BR>
All valid data will be entered into the environmental monitoring database used for the periodic trend analysis performed by WCS. Trend analysis results will be reported to TDH on a routine basis if required by license. Trend analyses will consist of a statistical evaluation of subsets of environmental data for verifying that the samples are (or are not) all within a background population, considering seasonal variability. The evaluation also will include a narrative interpretation of the data and the statistical analyses performed by WCS radiation protection personnel. The pre-operational environmental database will be used as input to the facility's performance assessment that will be completed as part of the license application for disposal of 1 1 e(2)/LLRW waste. Any future revisions to the projected site performance assessment because of changes in the source term will be accomplished only with the full knowledge and consent of TDH. Interpretations and conclusions based on the revised performance assessment will be valid only if agreed upon by TDH.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.2	Corrective Action Plan</B>
<BR>
The corrective action plan is a necessary part of the facility's environmental monitoring program. The plan establishes actions that will be taken by WCS if 11e(2)/ LLRW environrnental monitoring results exceed pre-established levels under the two tiered monitoring response program described in this section. This plan consists of a program for verification of monitoring results as discussed above and evaluation of the data with respect to site performance. The plan also calls for whatever procedural changes, administrative controls or other mitigation activities that may be necessary should this data evaluation indicate that regulatory limits could be exceeded.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.2.1 Setting Investigation and Action Levels</B>
<BR>
Ideally, an environmental monitoring program spans a continuum that extends from the pre-operational LLD to a baseline mean, then to a practical LLD for operational monitoring, then to an IL, thence to an AL, and finally to a regulatory limit. Since radionuclides have different limits and require widely varying analytical techniques, this is not always possible. It is possible for the continuum to be compressed so that the various milestones overlap even to the extreme (though rare) that the LLD could be equal to the regulatory limit. More realistically, however, there is likely to be overlap between the statistically based baseline mean, the investigation levels, the performance based regulatory limit and the action levels.



<BR><BR>


Variances for these different levels could be so large that AL could be less than
statistically based IL. This situation would require a different monitoring strategy. The
proposed action levels are based on concentrations of dosimetric significance relative to
the regulatory dose limits. The action levels are normally set at a higher value than the
investigation levels, so that the causes of increased concentrations can be evaluated prior
to taking any corrective actions. IL's and AL's are further discussed:
<BR><BR>
<DD>(a)	Investigation Levels.  An IL is set at some point above the baseline mean, usually
based on some statistically significant benchmark above the baseline mean. The
question which must be answered during operations is whether the data point
collected belongs to the population which was used to establish the baseline
statistic or to some other unknown population whose statistics are unknown. If the
former is true, there is a high probability that there has been no increase in
concentration due to facility operations. If the latter is true then there is the
probability that there has been an increase due to site operations.
<BR><BR>
If monitoring indicates that regulatory limits may be exceeded at any time in the
future, mitigating action would be required. However, variations in the projected
site performance are not cause for such action if the revised projections remain
within regulatory limits.

<BR><BR>
<DD>(b)	Action Levels.  The AL, or reporting level, is based on some percent of the

regulatory limit. In no cases shall the AL exceed 25 percent of the regulatory
limit. Exceeding an action level requires WCS to notify the TDH and to
investigate the cause since regulatory limits might be in jeopardy of being
exceeded. When the AL's are set at a very small percentage of the regulatory
limit or when background radioactivity levels are a large percentage of the
regulatory limits, reports of exceeding AL's become frequent, and both the
licensee and the regulator must understand the results have little meaning. The
radionuclides associated with l l e(2)/LLRW materials have relatively low
regulatory limits in relation to their natural background levels, resulting in a
"compressed" background-to-regulatory limit continuum.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.2.2 Investigation Level Responses</B><BR><BR>
Investigation level responses are those activities to be undertaken by WCS if; 1) IL's for
environmental samples are exceeded, or 2) trend analyses indicate that IL's could be
exceeded in subsequent samples but in neither case are AL's exceeded or in jeopardy of
being exceeded.
<BR><BR>
If a sample is deemed to be a valid representative of the data, follow-up activities will be
based on whether or not the sample exceeds the AL. If the sample exceeds the IL but not
the AL, the RSO will evaluate the results within the context of the facility performance
assessment to determine whether or not the result was expected. The RSO will evaluate
the potential regulatory significance and submit a report to the Vice President
Operations/ Facility Manager and the Vice President Nuclear Affairs.
<BR><BR>
Whether or not the elevated sample has potential regulatory significance, WCS will
undertake an investigation of its cause and augment feasible operating practices to
eliminate the cause of the elevated results in the sample. Investigation may include
comparisons with regional data, investigations of possible climatic or offsite phenomena,
which could have caused the elevated sample result, re-sampling and/or re-analysis,
increased frequency of sampling and escalated analysis (in the case of Gross Alpha and
Gross Beta results).
<BR><BR>
If results exceed investigation levels, the RSO will attempt to determine the cause to the
extent practicable. Reasons may include but are not limited to: (a) sample collection
quality control problems (b) laboratory quality control during their evaluation process; (c)
the data point is a true outlier; or (d) there has been a true change in population mean,
indicating an increase in constituent concentration has occurred. As a statistically
meaningful number of samples become available during operations monitoring, statistical
tests will be conducted using data subsets (e.g. pre-operations data and operations data or
annual groupings of operations data) to test the null hypothesis that the statistics for each
set of data are the same. This would indicate that the data are part of the same population
(i.e., no change in constituent levels has resulted from facility operations).
<BR><BR>
If the data suggests that there has been a statistically significant change (the null
hypothesis is rejected) the data's significance will be evaluated within the context of
projected facility performance and regulatory limits. Augmentation of operating
practices might be one course of action depending on the specific cause of an elevated
sample. Such augmentation would be proposed and carried out in accordance with
provisions for procedure revision in the license. A permanent record of the evaluation
will be made.
<BR><BR>
Gross alpha and beta are indicator parameters and are therefore assigned investigation
levels only. Exceeding the IL for these parameters requires an appropriate isotopic
analysis as a minimum. An additional investigation may be dictated by the results of the
isotopic analysis.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.2.3 Action Level Responses</B>
<BR><BR>
All environmental sample results exceeding prescribed AL's will be reported to the TDH
immediately (with appropriate caveats if the results have yet to be verified). The AL, as
defined for use at the WCS site, is that concentration of a radionuclide in a specific media
that, if exceeded, requires that a complete report be made to the TDH. The report will be
prepared by the RSO and will include monitoring results, investigations and findings,
significance of the data, possible adverse effects, and proposed mitigating measures. If
the follow up sample results are above the action level supplemental recommendation for
follow-up action will be submitted to TDH for review and approval. The follow-up
the potential regulatory significance and submit a report to the Vice President
Operations/ Facility Manager and the Vice President Nuclear Affairs.
<BR><BR>
Whether or not the elevated sample has potential regulatory significance, WCS will
undertake an investigation of its cause and augment feasible operating practices to
eliminate the cause of the elevated results in the sample. Investigation may include
comparisons with regional data, investigations of possible climatic or offsite phenomena,
which could have caused the elevated sample result, re-sampling and/or re-analysis,
increased frequency of sampling and escalated analysis (in the case of Gross Alpha and
Gross Beta results).
<BR><BR>
If results exceed investigation levels, the RSO will attempt to determine the cause to the
extent practicable. Reasons may include but are not limited to: (a) sample collection
quality control problems; (b) laboratory quality control during their evaluation process; (c)
the data point is a true outlier; or (d) there has been a true change in population mean,
indicating an increase in constituent concentration has occurred. As a statistically
meaningful number of samples become available during operations monitoring, statistical
tests will be conducted using data subsets (e.g. pre-operations data and operations data or
annual groupings of operations data) to test the null hypothesis that the statistics for each
set of data are the same. This would indicate that the data are part of the same population
(i.e., no change in constituent levels has resulted from facility operations).
<BR><BR>
If the data suggests that there has been a statistically significant change (the null
hypothesis is rejected) the data's significance will be evaluated within the context of
projected facility performance and regulatory limits. Augmentation of operating
practices might be one course of action depending on the specific cause of an elevated
sample. Such augmentation would be proposed and carried out in accordance with
provisions for procedure revision in the license. A permanent record of the evaluation
will be made.
<BR><BR>
Gross alpha and beta are indicator parameters and are therefore assigned investigation
levels only. Exceeding the IL for these parameters requires an appropriate isotopic
analysis as a minimum. An additional investigation may be dictated by the results of the
isotopic analysis.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.2.3 Action Level Responses</B><BR>
All environmental sample results exceeding prescribed AL's will be reported to the TDH
immediately (with appropriate caveats if the results have yet to be verified). The AL, as
defined for use at the WCS site, is that concentration of a radionuclide in a specific media
that, if exceeded, requires that a complete report be made to the TDH. The report will be
prepared by the RSO and will include monitoring results, investigations and findings,
significance of the data, possible adverse effects, and proposed mitigating measures. If
the follow up sample results are above the action level supplemental recommendation for
follow-up action will be submitted to TDH for review and approval. The follow-up




recommendations will include an evaluation of the significance of the result within the
context of the facility performance assessment and an evaluation of the regulatory
significance. If the sample is determined to have regulatory significance (by either TDH
or WCS or both), WCS will submit a corrective action plan for approval to the TDH.
Subsequent activities will proceed under the direction of the Vice President
Operations/Facility Manager who will implement the plan upon approval of the TDH.
<BR><BR>

Action level responses may include, separately or in combination, procedural changes
and escalated data evaluations, administrative changes, as well as mitigating activities
involving permanent changes in facility design and engineering as well as structures
emplaced for the sole purpose of mitigation.
<BR><BR>
Procedural changes and evaluations may include increasing the sampling frequency and
the number of radionuclides for which a sample is tested, investigation of the facility
source term to establish the likely cause of the elevated level, recommendations for
modifying operations to minimize potential for future elevated levels. Any such action
will be carried out with the full knowledge and consent of TDH and under their auspices.
<BR><BR>
Examples of mitigating administrative actions include operational modifications limiting
waste storage periods in the event fenceline TLDs show elevated results, to requiring
generators of certain waste types to pre-treat their waste to reduce radionuclide mobility.
<BR><BR>
Examples of structural or engineering mitigating measures include groundwater
extraction or emplacement of grout curtains. Exhumation of waste is generally the least
desirable alternative due to worker radiation exposure considerations. Specific
remediation actions necessarily are based on the precise circumstances present. While
prudent to note the possible use of these extensive measures in a corrective action plan,
the facility's location, design, and proposed operating practices greatly reduce the
likelihood that such measures would be necessary.
<BR><BR>
Response activities undertaken when action levels are exceeded are conducted to reduce
or eliminate elevated concentrations of radioactivity associated with the disposal facility.
Professional staff expertise will be required to evaluate each situation requiring
mitigating action. In certain instances, it may be necessary to employ professionals from
contracted companies to supplement WCS staff. In all cases, TDH will be consulted to
assure that activities are conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirements.
<BR><BR>
<B>7.3	Potential for Modification of Data Analysis and Response</B>
<BR><BR>
WCS will use the data generated by the operational environmental sampling program to
make refinements in predicting site performance. These refinements may prompt
modifications to the facility environmental nnonitoring and corrective action plans.
<BR><BR>
Modifications may include revising investigation or action levels; shifting emphasis from
one media to another; or focusing on other specific radionuclides or geochemical
constituents that may serve as better indicators of site performance. While proposals for
any such modifications to the basic program would be implemented only with the formal
approval of TDH, WCS may elect to augment its program with additional sampling as
recommended by the RSO.
