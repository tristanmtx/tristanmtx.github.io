<span class="text9">These drums are what you see a mile away from Highway 176. 
Note WCS's branding of the locale to "WCS Hill" to <BR>
disassociate the region from the original water-oriented 
"Windmill Hill" name.

This aerial photo is from the northwest.  
Hwy 176 is off to the right out of view.<BR>
The tower at the bottom edge is for power lines along the road and state line.<BR>
This is the main entrance to the site, where the road leads to the chain link fence.

<BR>

<BR><BR>
<img src="aerial1.jpg"><BR>
<span class="text9">This is an close-up aerial view from the southeast.<BR>  
You can see the drums in front as in the first picture,
with a railcar offloading area in front of that (far left).<BR>  
On the right outside of the building, rows of 18-wheeler trailer-boxes can be seen lined up.

<span class="text9">Zooming out a bit, this aerial view is also from the southeast.<BR> 
To the north (top-right edge) the hazardous waste landfill can be seen.
The road at the top of the photo extends toward Baker Spring.

<span class="text9">Zooming out even further and panning to the right, this  photo gives a view of the hazardous waste disposal pit.
<BR>The bottom half on the left has what appears to be an airfield, confirming what we have heard in our investigations.
