<B><font color="black">The Texas Compact: More States Already Trying to Bring Waste In </B></font><BR>
In a deal known as the Texas Compact, Texas was designated to be responsible to dump nuclear waste arriving from power plants in 
Maine and Vermont.  Maine decommissioned its nuclear power plant and removed itself from the deal effective in 2004, 
which virtually admitted that there is not a substantial need for disposal from sources other than nuclear power. [there is also a current effort
to extend the license for Vermont's nuclear power plant so that decommissioning would occur in 2033, and not the scheduled 2013]. 
The Texas Compact was the primary push for 2003 Texas legislation mandating the dumps to be operated by a private company.
The Compact's main selling point was that it would ensure that waste from states other than Maine and Vermont would not be
allowed to be dumped in Texas, yet, ever since the Compact was ratified by US Congress in 1998, it has been criticized for 
containing loopholes which circumvent this guarantee.  It states that the Commission overseeing the Compact can make exceptions
as they please to allow waste from any state in the country.<BR><BR>

Although no dump has been built, and no Commission yet assigned, Texas officials are already being solicited 
to recieve waste from outside of its Compact.   In our <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">section 
discussing Texas Compact</A>, we discuss how Texas is merely one interstate Compact amongst several across the nation, 
for which no dump has yet been built.  One of these Compacts is the Central Compact, comprised of Louisiana, Arkansas, 
Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.  Nebraska, like Texas, was designated as a 'host state' for this compact, meaning it 
is to receive waste from the other states for disposal.  A site in Boyd County, Neb. was considered for the site, 
but was rejected due to a high water table, among other suitability issues.
In 2003, the other states filed a lawsuit against Nebraska 
for not yet building a dumpsite for this purpose, suing the state for $151 million. 

As the case is currently being appealed in US Supreme Court, Nebraska Gov. Mike 
Johanns described that, with accrued interest and the conditions of the litigation, "the worst case 
scenario forces Nebraska to both pay the $202 million judgment and host a 
site that our own generators could be barred from accessing." 

 <BR><BR>
In April 2004, Gov. Johanns asked Tx. Gov. Rick Perry in a memo whether Texas would consider a flat fee of $25 
million to take compact's waste, with an additional $5 million to cover any unforeseen expenses.
Details of this proposal were kept mostly behind closed doors in both Texas and Nebraska Governor's 
offices, and state agencies declined to comment on the proposal.  
Later in August, Nebraska and the other states in the Central Compact had reached a settlement-  
Nebraska would pay $141 million in four annual 
payments of $38.5 million, and would not have to host the dump site.  
Additionally, the amount would be reduced to $130 million if disposal in Texas could be successfully negotiated.
Although there has been light chatter within the Central Compact's Commission that Kansas might host a dump, the 
incentive to send the waste to Texas still remains clear.

On February 28 2005, 
Rep. Mike Villarreal [D-San Antonio] submitted House Bill 1656, which adds a requirement that Texas 
radioactive waste disposal be limited to the compact member State of Vermont.  This bill never was allowed to leave its House Committee
by the end of the Session.

Governor Rick Perry has yet to appoint the Compact's Commissioners, but a preview
is seen in June 2004 appointments to the Texas Radiation Advisory Board, (Mitchell Lucas, TXU Energy; Bradley Bunn, Andrews Industrial Foundation; and Rick Jacobi, 
WCS consultant and ex-director of the TLLRWDA, which attempted to place a dump in Sierra Blanca, Texas)

<font color="black">May Update: The NRC has been considering a proposal from nuclear plant operators in Connecticut and Massachusetts
to import a total of 180 million pounds of decommissioning rubble and debris.  Some of this material may be "exempted" so that WCS would be allowed 
to dispose of it as hazardous, and not radioactive waste.  More details to come on the NRC's decision and more on this topic.
