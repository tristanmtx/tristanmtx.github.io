 LAS VEGAS SUN

 If nuclear power use expands, a proposed
repository at Yucca Mountain could end up with five to 10 times the
amount of radioactive waste that has been set by law, an
Energy Department official said.

 But it would take an act of Congress to increase
the amount, Russ Dyer, DOE Yucca Mountain project manager,
said this week during a tour of the mountain 90 miles northwest
of Las Vegas.

 "That suggestion is the reason that nuclear waste
must never come to Yucca Mountain," said Rep. Shelley
Berkley, D-Nev., who was on the tour and asked Dyer about expansion.

 Yucca Mountain, the lone site chosen to contain
commercial reactor and defense wastes, is under study to
determine whether it can contain up to 77,000 tons of high-level
nuclear waste.

 Congress set the amount of waste in the 1980s,
when it singled out Yucca Mountain from three sites that were
being examined.

 About 7,000 tons would come from weapons-related
activities, including Navy submarine reactors. The other
70,000 tons would be spent nuclear fuel from 103 commercial reactors.
 
 However, nuclear regulators are extending the
operating life of the nation's nuclear reactors, Dyer said.

 Five operating reactors have received 20-year
license extensions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. License
renewals for another five reactors are pending.

 Another 32 reactors are expected to apply for
license renewal by 2005.

 If all of those extensions are granted, about
120,000 tons of waste would have to be buried over the next 40
years just from existing reactors, and Yucca Mountain is the only
repository expected to be open, Dyer said.

 "There's no appetite in Congress to find a second
repository," Dyer said.

 If more reactors are built to meet growing energy
demands, the waste volume could increase to between 500,000
tons and 700,000 tons, he said.

 A repository at Yucca Mountain would have space
to expand, he said. It would require a vote of Congress.

 That might not be so easy, one congressional
watcher said. "I wouldn't say it would be an automatic win in
Congress these days," said Lisa Gue of Public Citizen, an
environmental watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader.

 Spokesmen for the nuclear industry and former
Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., author of the bill that singled
out Yucca Mountain, said they had not heard that the
repository might need to expand.
 
 "I have not heard that, since the amount of
nuclear waste is set by law," said Johnston, now a Washington lobbyist
representing international concerns including energy companies.
The former senator authored an amendment in 1987 known as the
"Screw Nevada" bill, which eliminated any other option for
managing nuclear waste except burying it in a proposed repository
at Yucca Mountain.

 The nuclear industry has never projected such
high numbers for its wastes or expanding a Yucca Mountain
repository, Steve Kerekes, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy
Institute in Washington, said.

 "I have never heard that," Kerekes said. "Right
now it's an open question."

 However, nuclear utilities are hoping that if the
energy crisis spreads from California across the country this
summer, it will revive a demand for nuclear power, he said.

 "While we're very confident there will be some
nuclear reactors built in the coming years, I have not heard of any
numbers of that kind," Kerekes said of the waste amounts
suggested by Dyer.

 Berkley has supported research funds for
alternatives to Yucca Mountain. Scientists are developing new techniques
to reduce the amount of nuclear waste using advanced
accelerators in Los Alamos National Laboratory. UNLV received $3 million of
the $34 million secured for accelerator research this year.

 A million dollars a day is being spent on
research on Yucca Mountain's suitability, and getting more to study
alternatives has been a hard sell in Congress, Steve Frishman,
technology coordinator for the state's Agency for Nuclear
Projects, said.

 DOE officials oppose spending a lot of money on
alternatives such as advanced accelerators, saying that they
would take too long and be cost prohibitive.

 But, Berkley said, more must be done.

 "I am opposed to any attempt to expand nuclear
energy in this country until we figure out what to do with the
nuclear wastes," Berkley said.

      Source: Wall Street Journal
      Published: 28Sep99 Author: Micah Morrison, WSJ Editorial Writer

AUSTIN, Texas--In April, the office of Gov. George W. Bush released a
statement summarizing his 1998 taxable income. Mr. Bush had earned over $18
million, the "vast majority"
from the sale of the Texas Rangers baseball team. The governor's share of
the Rangers sale was $14.9 million, his biggest payday ever.

Mr. Bush played a significant role in putting together the investment group
that purchased the Rangers in 1989; he later was named a general partner of
the franchise. Prior to his career
in baseball, he had struggled for more than a decade in the oil business.
How Mr. Bush parlayed a lackluster tenure in the oil patch into a $15
million home run and a seat in the
governor's mansion is a subtle morality tale about the highways and byways
to contemporary political power. Like Vice President Albert Gore Jr., who
will be the subject of an article on
this page tomorrow, Mr. Bush is the son of an influential politician. Like
Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush has crossed paths with some of the seamier characters
who gravitate toward political power.
And both men--while not without pluck and political skills of their
own--have profited from family connections.

This two-part series is not a tale of smoking guns and indictable offenses.
Yet voters should know the financial connections of candidates, though they
probably will make their decisions
on other grounds. And while the candidates will not appreciate questions
being raised about the murky areas of their finances, the lessons of the
Clinton era suggest that it is better to put
matters on the table early, lest they rise Whitewater-like to haunt a new
administration.

Mr. Bush's career with the Rangers baseball team, for example, is likely to
come under intense scrutiny in the next 12 months. In 1989, when Mr. Bush
brought together his investment
group to buy the Rangers, the seller was Eddie Chiles, a longtime friend
and supporter of President Bush. Mr. Chiles let the president's son and his
group go to the head of the line. But
in a pattern repeated through his business career, Mr. Bush's play did not
quite make the grade. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth stepped in,
brokering a deal that brought Fort
Worth financier Richard Rainwater together with the Bush group. Mr.
Ueberroth's pitch to Mr. Rainwater was that he join the deal partly "out of
respect" for President Bush, a source
close to the negotiations told the New York Times.

Mr. Bush ponied up $500,000 as his personal grubstake in the $86 million
purchase. He later invested another $106,000, bringing his share to 1.8% of
the team. For his organizing
efforts, his new partners rewarded him with an additional 10% interest.
They also named him a managing general partner, a move that assured Mr.
Bush a series of benign cameos in the
limelight as he ramped up a run for Texas governor. Mr. Bush kept a low
profile as his new baseball partners aggressively and successfully lobbied
for a special referendum in which the
voters of Arlington, Texas, approved a sales-tax increase to cover the $135
million cost of a new stadium. Texas conservatives denounced the measure as
"corporate welfare."

Mr. Bush borrowed the $500,000 for his stake in the Rangers from United
Bank of Midland, Texas, where he had served as a director from 1984 to
1986. Karen Hughes, a
spokeswoman for Gov. Bush, declined to detail the terms of the loan. But
she said it was a "fully collateralized, traditional loan, and fully paid
off."

In fact, the loan was paid off through the sale of stock Mr. Bush had been
awarded in his only successful venture in the oil business, as a director
of Texas-based Harken Energy Corp.
Barely afloat in the tough oil market in the early 1980s, Mr. Bush joined
Harken as a director in 1986. He was given 212,000 shares of Harken stock,
worth about $500,000, or $2.50 a
share, at the end of the year--although he had no daily management
responsibilities. He later acquired an additional 133,000 shares through
special offerings to company directors, and he
was paid between $42,000 and $120,000 a year for the next five years as a
consultant.

Prior to joining Harken, Mr. Bush's business record was not good. He
started his first firm, Arbusto Energy, in 1977, the headiest days of the
oil patch, and was buffeted along with all
the others by the high interest rates and collapsing oil prices of the next
few years. Hoping to boost its fortunes, he changed Arbusto's name to Bush
Exploration, then merged it with
Spectrum 7 Energy Corp. in an effort to stay afloat. As the hard times
continued, Spectrum merged with Harken Energy.

Harken viewed Mr. Bush's famous name as an important asset, oil industry
executives close to the deal have said. Harken officials will not comment
about Mr. Bush, but records show
that the company's stock began to climb right after the Spectrum merger was
announced, hitting $6 a share within a year before falling back. Mr. Bush
was philosophical about losing his
management role in the oil business but retaining profit. "I try to talk up
Harken whenever I can," he told Forbes magazine in June 1987, "and I'd feel
a lot worse if the stock hadn't
tripled."

In 1989, Harken's stock was trading at between $4 and $5 a share. That's
when Mr. Bush put up his shares as collateral for the Rangers loan. In
January 1990, with shares trading
around $4.50, Harken announced that it had signed a potentially lucrative
oil-exploration deal with the government of Bahrain. On June 20, 1990, Mr.
Bush sold the bulk of his Harken
stock for $848,000, at $4 a share, and paid off the Rangers loan. Eight
days later, Harken finished the second quarter with losses of $23 million,
and the stock went into a nosedive,
losing nearly 75% of its value, finishing the year at a little over $1 a share.

Critics of Mr. Bush cried foul, charging that as a Harken director he was
in a position to trade illegally on insider information before the stock's
decline. Mr. Bush ultimately was cleared
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But suspicions of Mr. Bush's
lucky timing had heightened at first, when the SEC, discovering that he had
not filed the proper disclosure
form, opened an investigation into the president's son. Mr. Bush claimed
that he did file the correct form, but that it had been lost. He also said
that he had cleared the stock sale with
Harken's general counsel.

"At the time of the sale," explained Ms. Hughes, the Bush spokeswoman, "he
did not know about the losses that would later be posted." Mr. Bush was not
selling ahead of bad news,
Ms. Hughes said, but into the good news that the Bass brothers, Texas
billionaires with deep pockets and overseas drilling experience, were
inking a joint-exploration pact with Harken in
Bahrain. In October 1993, the SEC sent Mr. Bush's attorney a letter stating
that "the investigation has been terminated into the conduct of Mr. Bush,
and that, at this time, no enforcement
action is contemplated with respect to him."

Harken's Bahrain deal was also a piece of exceptional luck. It raised
oil-industry eyebrows when the government of that Persian Gulf state
announced it had chosen tiny Harken to
explore an offshore site for gas and oil. Harken appeared to have little to
offer the Bahrainis. It had no overseas experience and no experience with
offshore drilling. Bahrain officials
have since said they had no idea President Bush's son was associated with
Harken, a claim oil-industry sources ridicule. Former Harken exploration
chief Monte Swetnam told the New
York Times earlier this year that there "was never a question" that
Bahraini officials knew about Mr. Bush and that they "were clearly aware
that he was the President's son."

The Bahrain deal was brokered in part by Arkansas investment banker David
Edwards, one of Bill Clinton's closest friends. Formerly an employee of
Arkansas investment powerhouse
Stephens Inc., Mr. Edwards now runs his own firm in Little Rock and has
wide connections in the Middle East. At the start of President Clinton's
first term, he brokered a $23 million
Saudi contribution for a Middle East studies center at the University of
Arkansas at Fayetteville.

While Mr. Edwards was at Stephens, one of his clients was Saudi financier
Abdullah Taha Bakhsh. In 1987, soon after Mr. Bush joined Harken, Mr.
Edwards brought Mr. Bakhsh
together with the Texas firm. Harken was struggling with debt and in need
of cash. Mr. Bakhsh bought a 17% stake in the company. His American
representative, Chicago businessman
Talat Othman, was given a seat on Harken's board. By August 1990, Mr.
Othman was attending White House meetings with President Bush to discuss
Middle East policy. Mr. Bakhsh
and Mr. Othman did not respond to an interview request. But in 1995 an
attorney representing both men told the Journal that Mr. Othman's visits to
the White House were solely based
on his "longstanding involvement in Arab-American affairs."

Mr. Bakhsh also was a co-investor in Saudi Arabia with Ghaith Pharaon, a
front man for the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which
was shut down in 1991 with
some $10 billion in losses following a global looting spree. Mr. Bakhsh's
banker in Saudi Arabia was Khalid bin Mahfouz, head of the country's
largest bank, National Commercial, and
one of the key players in the BCCI scandal. Stephens Inc. also crossed
paths with BCCI, handling an early, unsuccessful effort by figures later
identified as BCCI front men to acquire
Financial General Bankshares, a Washington, D.C., bank holding company.
Stephens withdrew from the deal, but within a few years the same group of
front men won Federal Reserve
approval to buy Financial General.

In 1992, Mr. bin Mahfouz was charged by Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau and the Federal Reserve Board in separate actions with scheming
to conceal BCCI's role in
U.S. banking. He reached a settlement in which he paid $225 million in
fines and restitution, with the understanding that he would not again seek
a major role in U.S. banking. Mr.
Pharaon has been permanently banned from the U.S. banking industry and
fined $37 million for his role in the BCCI scandal. Mr. Bakhsh was never
charged with any wrongdoing and
his attorney told the Journal that the Saudi financier "was not involved in
any way in any of the matters or transactions that constituted the BCCI
scandal."

It wasn't long after introducing Mr. Bakhsh and his money to Harken Energy
that Mr. Edwards again surfaced with another lucrative deal. In 1988, the
government of Bahrain had
retained Houston oil consultant Michael Ameen, a former head of
governmental relations for Aramco and an old friend of Mr. Bakhsh, to
handle the search for a company to explore a
possible new oil and gas field offshore. Mr. Edwards, who by then had left
Stephens, learned of the Bahrain contract from Mr. Ameen and soon was
representing Harken with the
Bahrainis. Harken quickly beat out the big boys for the oil-exploration
franchise; Bahraini officials have explained that they were looking for a
small company that would devote full
attention to them. Mr. Edwards did not respond to an interview request.

A wide-ranging 1991 team report by Wall Street Journal reporters Thomas
Petzinger Jr., Peter Truell and Jill Abramson revealed many of the BCCI
links to Mr. Bush and Harken, but
found no evidence of improbity by anyone connected to the company. "The
mosaic of BCCI connections surrounding Harken Energy may prove nothing more
than how ubiquitous the
rogue bank's ties were," the article noted. "But the number of
BCCI-connected people who had dealings with Harken--all since George W.
Bush came on board--likewise raises the
question of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presidential son."

Mr. Bush told the Journal in 1994 that he had been "against the Bahrain
deal" and he had "no idea that BCCI figured into" Harken's financial
dealings. Harken officials refuse to release
any documents, such as board minutes, that might support Mr. Bush, though
two company executives have publicly stated he opposed the Bahrain
operation. The Bahrain oil project
resulted in two dry holes and Harken Energy abandoned the project. Mr. Bush
had pretty much cashed out by then, and in November 1993 he resigned from
Harken's board. He was
replaced by the well-connected Mr. Ameen.

The international oil business has produced a rich set of ties between
Saudi Arabia and Texas. To this day, Mr. bin Mafouz of National Commercial
Bank and BCCI maintains a palatial
home in Houston. He has also had a long and varied business association
with James Bath, an aircraft broker and friend of George W. Bush from their
days together in the Texas Air
National Guard. Mr. Bath invested $50,000 in Mr. Bush's first company,
Arbusto Energy. In 1978, Mr. Bath became a director of Houston's Main Bank.
Among his fellow investors
was Mr. bin Mahfouz, the Saudi banker and BCCI principal; Mr. Pharaon, the
BCCI front man; and former Treasury Secretary and Texas Gov. John Connally.
Main Bank was
absorbed into larger banks in a series of industry mergers in the 1980s.

Mr. Bath's interesting connections to Saudi Arabia go back to at least
1976. It was then, according to a report in the Houston Chronicle, that
Salem bin Laden, heir to one of the largest
building companies in the Middle East, signed a trust agreement appointing
Mr. Bath his Houston representative. (Salem bin Laden's half-brother, Osama
bin Laden, has in recent years
gained world-wide notoriety as a funder of fundamentalist terrorism, though
he has reportedly broken with his family in Saudi Arabia). Court documents
show that Mr. Bath purchased
an airfield in south Texas, Houston Gulf Airport, in 1978 on behalf of
Salem bin Laden.

Mr. bin Laden died in a plane crash near San Antonio in 1988, and his
interest in the airfield passed to Mr. bin Mahfouz, according to the
Chronicle. Mr. Bath also founded Southwest
Airport Services to manage Houston Gulf Airport and to provide fueling
service at another Houston-area airport, Ellington Field, where the company
fueled military aircraft.

Mr. Bath was as well the president of Skyway Aircraft Leasing Ltd., a
Cayman Islands-registered company that acted as a supplier of large
passenger and cargo jets. According to a court
document cited by the Houston Chronicle, and to someone familiar with
Skyway's operation who spoke recently to the Journal, the true owner was
Mr. bin Mahfouz. Mr. Bath did not
respond to requests for an interview.

Questioned by the Houston Post in 1990, Mr. Bush said he had "never done
any business" with Mr. Bath, but that Mr. Bath was "a lot of fun." Last
month, Ms. Hughes, the Bush
spokeswoman, said that other than the Arbusto investment, "Gov. Bush did
not have any other financial dealings with Mr. Bath." She said Gov. Bush
has seen Mr. Bath once or twice at
social events over the past six years.

A review of the Bush record as governor finds few traces of the past
financial connections reviewed above. The one exception might be the
January appointment of Kem Thompson
Frost, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Bath, to the Texas 14th Court of
Appeals. Ms. Frost's law firm, Winstead, Sechrest & Minick, has contributed
to Mr. Bush's gubernatorial and
presidential campaigns an amount that "exceeds $50,000," according to
Texans for Public Justice, a campaign-finance monitor. In a brief telephone
interview, Judge Frost said her work
for Mr. Bath "ended in the early 1990s." She added that she had "never met
Gov. Bush, never discussed Mr. Bath with any of his representatives, and
filled out a standard judicial
application."

If he wins the presidency, Mr. Bush would have great direct and indirect
influence over issues of more moment to his past associates--such as
relations with Saudi Arabia. Issues of law
enforcement also are particularly sensitive, as we've seen in the Clinton
administration. Mr. bin Mahfouz has never been explicitly banned from U.S.
banking, for example, and has
vigorously tried to rehabilitate his reputation--at one point enlisting the
aid of Harvard Law Prof. Laurence Tribe to write a 38-page report
denouncing BCCI prosecutors for
"scapegoating" the Saudi banker. More recently, Mr. bin Mahfouz was ousted
as head of National Commercial Bank in a murky power play reportedly
engineered by the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency. A family representative says Mr. bin Mahfouz then confined
himself to a military hospital for treatment of drug abuse; his wife and
sons still maintain a substantial
stake in the bank.

Any president has to balance his public duties with his inevitable private
associations. Mr. Bush has collected a rather rich assortment of
connections in his career as the son of a man
who was president, vice president and director of the Central Intelligence
Agency. His personal financial position seems secure, thanks in no small
way to friends of his father. This is of
course no disqualification from serving as president. Indeed, a charitable
voter might consider it a plus, on the assumption that the experience has
taught him some lessons and he has
learned something aboutwhen to keep a healthy distance.

Houston Biz Journal From the September 6, 1996 print edition 
Small firm sees bonanza in DOE waste 
Stakes are high in government deal to develop radioactive landfill 
Ann De Rouffignac

Waste Control Specialists Inc. of Pasadena is working on a megamillion-dollar deal
that would allow the small company to handle and dispose of federal low-level
radioactive waste at its landfill in far West Texas.

WCS has entered discussions with the U.S. Department of Energy to both process and
dispose of low-level radioactive waste from DOE's 90 sites across the country. If
the DOE agrees to send its waste to the WCS facility in Andrews County, the company
would get rich quick. WCS would have profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars
over the life of the landfill, leapfrogging to the top of a handful of U.S.
radioactive waste processing and disposal companies.

The deal would also place Texas in the league of Nevada, Utah and a few other states
with the largest nuclear waste facilities in the nation.

By focusing exclusively on the federal market, WCS would be able to bypass most
state and federal environmental agencies and capitalize on the eagerness of Andrews
County business leaders to welcome the facility to their area.

For handling and storage of nuclear waste -- even from federal sources -- the
company must be licensed by the Texas Department of Health. The WCS application is
now pending at that agency.

But it is still unclear what agency, if any, has jurisdiction over the disposal of
federal radioactive waste in Texas. The staff of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission is currently researching that question at the request of the
agency's executive director.

The stakes are huge because the DOE has an estimated cleanup bill of about $5
billion for low-level radioactive waste and twice that amount for mixed waste
(radioactive waste mixed with hazardous waste), according to a June 1996 report by
the Environmental Business Journal.

The DOE is still trying to decide whether to "centralize, regionalize or localize"
the disposal process for the low-level radioactive waste and mixed waste waiting for
a permanent home at DOE's 90 sites, says department spokeswoman Jane Brady. She
insists that the DOE "is far from making a decision yet."

The DOE declines to estimate its quantities of low-level and mixed radioactive waste
or costs associated with its disposal. But Kenneth N. Bigham, chief executive
officer and founder of WCS, is willing to estimate.

"You can talk about billions of dollars here. The federal government would go broke
disposing of all of it," he says.

As for WCS, the company's only activity is its hazardous waste storage and disposal
facility currently under construction in Andrews County. Bigham has already invested
$15 million in its development, he says.

The site has the advantage of being isolated, in the desert and on top of a thick
layer of clay that will theoretically prevent any contamination of the Ogallala
Aquifer that runs beneath it.

Although the landfill facility was originally intended for hazardous waste disposal,
that market has grown fiercely competitive as generators have successfully reduced
waste volumes. So after receiving the hazardous waste permit in 1994, Bigham
switched strategies and pursued the more lucrative and robust radioactive waste
market.

WCS then received a new capital infusion from Valhi Inc., a Dallas-based
billion-dollar conglomerate that poured in another $25 million and became a joint
owner of the facility.

Harold Simmons, a Dallas billionaire who is chief executive officer of Valhi, is
also a campaign supporter of Gov. George W. Bush. Both Simmons and Bigham have said
the governor is "aware" of the plans for federal radioactive waste in Andrews
County.

"They (Valhi) will provide whatever money we need. It's an open-ended sort of deal,"
Bigham says.

Bigham is no stranger to the waste business. In 1988, he formed Technical
Environmental Systems Inc. in the Houston area as a hazardous waste services
company. That company transported, stored and arranged for disposal of hazardous
wastes for small generators. But the company did not have a disposal permit of its
own.

Laidlaw Environmental Services bought the firm in 1991, giving Bigham what is
reported to be a handsome profit. Having failed to develop a hazardous waste
landfill in the Houston area, Bigham turned his attentions to West Texas and
radioactive waste.

NO OVERSIGHT?

Radioactive waste disposal in Texas is a sticky question. State law says that only a
state-owned public entity can dispose of nuclear waste in Texas. Texas has already
created a state agency, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, that is
the only entity allowed to dispose of radioactive waste.

The authority is currently developing a site in Hudspeth County -- also in West
Texas, about 150 miles south of the WCS site -- to receive waste from Texas
commercial generators and possibly from Maine and Vermont. But at that site, the
required TNRCC disposal permit is pending the outcome of public hearings and faces
stiff opposition from local residents.

WCS tried to change state law in the 1995 legislative session so it could also
accept commercial radioactive waste for disposal. That effort was soundly defeated
in the House.

"When we failed to change the state law, Ken Bigham got smarter and looked at
federal waste exempt from state law," says Bigham.

By seeking federal waste only, WCS claims that no state environmental agency
disposal permit is required.

"The DOE could issue an order and I could go in business tomorrow," says Bigham.

Still, he says he will only dispose of low-level radioactive waste with the state's
blessing.

WCS and "others" asked the TNRCC to look into what involvement, if any, that agency
would have in the disposal of DOE waste exclusively, says Terry Hadley, spokesman
for the TNRCC. The agency legal staff is preparing a report that is due by
mid-September.

However, state Rep. Robert Talton of Pasadena, a vocal opponent of the Andrews
County dump, insists that any reading of state law says WCS cannot dump radioactive
waste, no matter where it comes from. That law would have to be changed by the
Legislature, he says.

"They're back. I shake my head at this. It's not good as far as I'm concerned; it's
the games they play," Talton says.

By seeking only DOE nuclear waste for disposal, the WCS facility would also escape
regulation by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Environmental
Protection Agency. The DOE is self-regulated.

When the NRC became aware of WCS plans to dispose of federal low-level radioactive
waste, the agency asked its general counsel to look into the issue. The NRC
regulates high-level waste disposal and the nation's nuclear power plants.

"The WCS proposal raises some novel legal issues. The appropriate regulatory
authority for oversight of WCS' proposed activities has not been identified," states
a recent NRC newsletter.

Only if the landfill accepts some low-level radioactive waste from commercial
sources would the EPA have any right to regulate it, under provisions of the Clean
Air Act, says David Bary, spokesman for EPA's Region 6. If the facility goes for DOE
or Department of Defense waste only, then the EPA has no authority, he adds.

Andrews County business leaders have enthusiastically welcomed the disposal site as
a shot in the arm to the county's declining ranching and oil and gas based economy.
The original permit application for hazardous waste went through without resistance
from residents of nearby Andrews, the county seat, which has a population of about
14,000.

Even when Bigham sought in July to amend the hazardous waste permit and add
radioactive waste to his handling and processing plans, the amendment was supported
by the community -- especially the Andrews Industrial Foundation, which sent letters
of support. The TNRCC approved the change.

But disposal is another matter.

HEALTH QUESTIONS

After Bigham applied in March for his license from the Texas Department of Health's
Bureau of Radiation Control, the bureau responded with a five-page letter in May
detailing why the application was "severely deficient."

The company subsequently filed additional material, and the bureau has begun the
review process, says Wesley Dunn, the bureau's deputy director of licensing. A
decision is due this fall.

The health department issues licenses to all facilities in Texas that possess or
store nuclear material, no matter where that material comes from, says Dunn. The two
exceptions are federally owned facilities that have original jurisdiction and
commercial nuclear power plants regulated by the NRC.

Currently, there are only three licenses for processing of nuclear waste in Texas.
Two companies with "Type A" licenses for very small amounts of material are
reportedly closing down, says Dunn.

That leaves NSSI of Houston, which holds a "Type B" license for processing and
storage of low-level and mixed radioactive waste at its facility in northwest
Houston. That type of license allows the company to handle specific levels of
radioactivity in limited quantities.

WCS' "Type C" application, if approved, would make its new facility the largest
nuclear processing and storage facility in Texas -- and among the top in the nation.
This type of application for processing and storing low-level waste, mixed waste and
some transuranic waste, carries with it no specific limits on the amount of material
in each category, says Dunn.

"This is a very major deal -- at least a hundred times that of NSSI. We will look at
it carefully," he says.

With the unrestricted amounts of waste material allowed under a Class C permit,
Bigham says he can't estimate how much waste the company would process or store at
the Andrews facility.

"The market will dictate how much that is," says Bigham.

The DOE has accumulated a staggering amount of mixed waste stored on its sites
throughout the nation. In some facilities that do not have original jurisdiction,
the department is under pressure from the EPA to remove the mixed waste by certain
deadlines. Each facility is different, and the DOE has negotiated separate
agreements with the different states concerning what to do with the waste, says
DOE's Brady.

Clearly, more waste is being generated as the DOE continues its decommissioning of
the old nuclear weapons fuel sites. Observers agree that the federal market for
processing and disposal of low-level and especially mixed waste is huge.

Houston Biz Journal From the October 4, 1996 print edition Utah firm joins rush to
dump radioactive waste in West Texas Ann De Rouffignac

In what appears to be a modern-day land rush to dispose of radioactive waste in West
Texas, a Utah company has purchased acreage in Andrews County virtually next door to
the radioactive dump site proposed by Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists Inc.

Envirocare of Utah bought 880 acres of Andrews County ranchland and filed a
preliminary application last week with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission seeking permission to open a radioactive disposal facility near Waste
Control's complex.

Because Andrews County has enthusiastically welcomed Waste Control's proposal to
process, store and dispose of hazardous and radioactive waste, Envirocare also
decided to set up shop there after a "countrywide search" for an appropriate site.

"We searched around the country and found what we think is the best site -- in
Andrews County, Texas," says Charles Judd, executive vice president of Envirocare of
Utah.

"The key element is public acceptance of a facility. We think we found a place where
there is local support," he says.

Envirocare's proposed facility would be competing for the same business as Waste
Control -- federally generated low-level radioactive and mixed waste from the U.S.
Department of Energy. But some experts say that market is so huge that there's room
for both companies to operate disposal facilities in the far West Texas ranching
area.

"There's tons of market -- enough for both of us," says Judd.

Most of the waste would come from out-of--state DOE facilities -- a market estimated
by industry experts to be in the billions of ollars.

Envirocare's acreage is located 23 miles west of the town of Andrews and south of
Route 176, says Judd. Waste Control's landfill is under construction about 30 miles
west of Andrews at the New Mexico border.

But Waste Control says it is not worried about the competition and dismisses
Envirocare's application to the TNRCC.

"We consider it a publicity ploy. We don't take it seriously," says Bill Miller, a
spokesman for Waste Control. "Either way you look at it, it doesn't matter to us."

Envirocare's announcement brings to three the total planned radioactive disposal
sites for West Texas. So far, none has received all the required permits to operate.

The third facility is a state-sponsored site to be located in Hudspeth County, about
150 miles southwest of the Andrews County sites. The state's Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority is developing the Hudspeth site, which will be officially
authorized to dispose of commercially generated radioactive waste from within Texas
-- and also from Vermont and Maine, if Congress approves.

The Hudspeth disposal permit, however, is being vigorously contested by local
residents. It is in the hearing stage before the TNRCC.

At Clive, Utah, Envirocare operates one of the only privately owned, licensed
facilities for commercial disposal of mixed waste and Class A low-level radioactive
wastes in the country. But the perceived new market is the DOE-generated "hotter"
waste (classified Class B and C) -- the type of waste also sought by Waste Control.

Envirocare sought Utah state permits to accept waste with the higher radioactivity
at its existing facility. But Utah was not receptive to the idea, leading Envirocare
to look elsewhere to expand its business, says Judd.

The Waste Control site has received strong support from business leaders in Andrews
County, who believe it would provide an economic boost, and from at least one area
legislator. But whether local community support will be enough to allow both
Envirocare and Waste Control Specialists to dispose of federal radioactive wastes in
Texas remains to be seen.

Permanent disposal of such waste by private companies in Texas is still under a
jurisdictional cloud that will be cleared up only when state authorities decide
which agency, if any, has oversight.

"We are looking at it to see if the state has any jurisdiction," says Terry Hadley,
spokesman for the TNRCC.

Meanwhile, a legal wrangle may be brewing over whether there can be any privately
owned radioactive dumps in Texas at all.

According to state Rep. Robert Talton of Pasadena, state law prohibits any entity
except the state-designated Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority from
operating a radioactive disposal site in Texas.

Any attempt to operate a privately owned site would require state law to be changed,
he insists.

Talton worries that Texas will be opened up for radioactive waste dumping from
"everyone" if the Envirocare and Waste Control plans go through.

"We should have learned from the Superfunds that privates didn't clean up their
mess. We'll get a super mess," he says. "Who paid for it last time? Taxpayers. I
don't want taxpayers to pay again."

Talton vows he will fight any change in the law or any decision to allow dumping of
radioactive waste in Texas except by the state-designated authority.

"We'll fight this in court if necessary," he says.

Envirocare says it is seeking whatever permits may be required in an open fashion.

"Whatever they (state agencies) require, we'll do it," says Judd. "If the folks in
Texas say no, we won't insist. We'll go away."

From the November 15, 1996 print edition
HL&P opts for early replacement of STP generators
Nuclear plant repair job could cost $230 million
Ann De Rouffignac  

Houston Lighting & Power Co. has decided to replace the steam generators at
Unit 1 of its South Texas Project nuclear power plant six years ahead of
schedule.

The big repair job, estimated by industry sources to cost about $230 million,
will be done in the year 2000 during a scheduled refueling outage instead of
in 2006, utility officials confirm.

The Light Co. presented its steam generator replacement plan last month to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to NRC documents.

"The replacement is caused chiefly by economics," says John Taylor, a
spokesman for the South Texas Project plant at Bay City.

"We will have to replace them anyway. By doing it early, we avoid costly
maintenance time, additional inspections and repairs," Taylor says.

The South Texas Project's reactors are outfitted with Westinghouse steam
generators intended to last 40 years. Unit 1 went on line in 1988.

The heat transfer tubes in these particular steam generators have been
plagued with a tendency to corrode earlier than expected, leading to cracks
or even ruptures. This problem, which has been a source of costly outages and
repairs to utilities across the country, has led to 13 different lawsuits
against Westinghouse over the past several years.

HL&P filed and settled a similar lawsuit against Westinghouse in 1990, but
the terms of the settlement are sealed.

HL&P officials last week declined to say how much the steam generator
replacement will cost or to comment on whether Houston ratepayers and the
other owners of the project -- Central Power & Light Co. of Corpus Christi,
City Public Service of San Antonio and the City of Austin -- will have to pay
for this major surgery to keep the plant alive.

"The cost of the steam generator replacement can't be separated out from the
settlement agreement," says Taylor.

The company's suit against Westinghouse was settled out of court last
December, but at the request of Westinghouse its terms were sealed by court
order. Westinghouse claimed trade secrets could be violated, and the parties
to the HL&P suit agreed to the closed-door settlement.

Steam generators contain thousands of U-shaped tubes that circulate extremely
hot water heated from the core of the reactor. The heat from this radioactive
loop causes water on the non-radioactive side of the tubing to turn to steam,
providing the power to drive the turbines to generate electricity. Corrosion
of the tubes and resulting leaks require expensive downtime and repairs.

Leaks from the "hot" side of the steam generator tubes are particularly
harmful, because radioactive coolant escapes and contaminates the
non-radioactive "cool" side of the power plant. And worse than a leak is a
tube rupture, because radioactive water can flow into the secondary system at
the rate of several hundred gallons per minute, says Jim Riccio, director of
nuclear research for Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.

During the last major outage of the South Texas Project in 1993, when HL&P
did a complete inspection, the utility concluded that steam generator
replacement would not be needed until 2006.

However, new data from subsequent inspections suggests that the "degradation
of the tubes" will accelerate after the year 2000 and require frequent
repairs, says Ron Baker, steam generator engineer at the South Texas Project.

"With the new data, 24 percent to 25 percent of the tubes would be plugged or
sleeved by 2006," says Baker.

The idea is to replace the generators before the problems accelerate, he
explains.

HL&P says that only 5.3 percent of the tubes are forecast to be plugged or
repaired in 2000, the year of replacement. Currently, 1.3 percent are
plugged.

"Most steam generators can still operate at full power with as many as 12
percent to 15 percent of the tubes plugged," says David Schlissel, a nuclear
plant consultant with Schlissel Technical Consulting in Massachusetts. Some
plants even operate with 25 percent plugged, but then the output of the plant
must be reduced, he says.

"If you're having problems, it makes sense to move it (replacement of the
generators) forward. Otherwise, it's an economic decision," says Schlissel.

Other sources suggest that early replacement of the steam generators at South
Texas may be more about the coming of competition to the electricity market
than about degradation of the tubes. Replacing the generators early could
make ratepayers pay for any costs not covered by the settlement, and also
lessen future downtime of the plant when competition will be hitting nuclear
plants hard.

"This is all about competition coming to Texas; they want captive ratepayers
to pay for it," charges Tom Smith, director of Texas Public Citizen in
Austin.

"We think it should have to be approved by the PUC (Public Utility
Commission) to keep them from repairing a plant that is no longer
cost-effective. Study after study indicates the operation and maintenance
costs alone of STP are greater than the cost of replacement power," Smith
says.

Nothing has been filed at the PUC concerning the replacement of the steam
generators yet. But, should HL&P want to recover any of the costs from
ratepayers, the company would have to get PUC approval to do so, says Anne
Roussos, spokeswoman for the commission.

WCS pitches west Texas site to DOE

Nuclear waste pitch. Waste Control Specialists LLC of Pasadena submitted a proposal
to the U.S. Department of Energy seeking authorization to use the company's Andrews
County disposal site for much of the low-level radioactive and mixed waste from
DOE's weapons complex cleanup.

If the federal department agrees to send its waste to Waste Control's facility in
the West Texas desert, the profits realized over the life of the landfill could put
WCS among the top radioactive waste processing and disposal companies in the nation.

The WCS proposal would preserve DOE's legal authority over its radioactive waste,
but an independent oversight board led by Texas Tech University would oversee the
continuing operation of the site. ================== Houston Biz Journal

From the April 11, 1997 print edition Bill would keep radioactive waste site alive
Ann De Rouffignac

An obscure clause in a pending state bill would allow the only low-level radioactive
waste dump in Texas to remain open.

Monsanto Chemical Co. has operated the waste site on the banks of Chocolate Bayou
south of Houston for more than 30 years, the last six years with an expired permit.

In 1981, the Texas Legislature changed state law and created an agency to dispose of
all low-level radioactive waste in Texas. Every waste site closed in subsequent
years except the one operated by Monsanto. But a bill now being considered by the
current Legislature would revise that law.

House Bill 1426, an omnibus act designed to upgrade the state's environmental safety
code relating to radioactive waste, contains a clause that would allow private
parties once again to operate noncommercial waste sites (all commercial sites, those
that accept outside waste, would still be overseen by the state).

Passage of the bill would directly benefit Monsanto, which has been disposing of
waste at the Chocolate Bayou plant without a valid permit since 1991.

A plant official acknowledges that the company discussed the situation with
officials of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

"We started talking to the TNRCC to see how we can continue. They said the wording
(in the state law) had to be changed," says Don Mead, safety and environmental
officer at the Chocolate Bayou plant.

"If forced to adhere to the letter of the law, the TNRCC couldn't allow us to keep
on doing this," adds Mead.

The TNRCC, in cooperation with the Bureau of Radiation Control, drafted a bill that
would alter the Health and Safety Code and bring definitions of radioactive waste
disposal, processing and handling into conformance with federal standards. H.B. 1426
was filed by Rep. Warren Chisum, chairman of the Committee on Environmental
Regulation, in late February. Rep. Chisum did not return phone calls.

The TNRCC claims that Monsanto requested insertion of the clause into the general
definitions bill; the chemical company contends that the language was drafted by the
state commission.

An environmental attorney says the bill could potentially pave the way for a new
wave of private, noncommercial radioactive waste sites in Texas.

"House Bill 1426 could open the door to the big utilities that own nuclear power
plants to dispose of the waste on their land," says David Frederick, with the firm
of Henry, Lowerre, Johnson, Hess, Frederick in Austin. "If Comanche Peak or South
Texas Project decided to dispose of the waste on site, the TNRCC could issue
permits."

Despite these concerns, officials of Houston Lighting & Power Co., operator and part
owner of South Texas Project nuclear plant, say the local utility is in no hurry to
dispose of its waste on site.

"We have no plans to develop our own disposal facility and feel strongly that the
safest method to dispose of low level waste in Texas is at one central monitored
location," says STP spokesman Alan Mikus.

Breck Henderson of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission points out that any new
proposed waste site would still have to comply with federal regulations even if the
state law is changed.

While Monsanto currently operates the only active low-level radioactive waste site
in Texas, three other entities shut down similar facilities.

The permits were issued by the Bureau of Radiation Control of the Department of
Health in the early 1960s and mid-'70s.

Iso-Tex of Friendswood still produces pharmaceuticals but discontinued the practice
of radioactive waste disposal several years ago, says Alice Rogers of the TNRCC.

Textin of Texas City is no longer in operation and is currently being considered by
the Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund site, Rogers says.

Texas A&M University discontinued the practice in 1978, says Chris Meyer, radiation
safety officer at the university.

Permits for these three sites expired between 1991 and 1995, after the state law was
changed in 1989 to eliminate existing private waste sites.

Monsanto's license to dispose of radioactive waste was originally issued in 1963 and
expired in 1991.

TNRCC spokesman Patrick Shaughnessy says Monsanto is eligible for permit renewal
because the chemical company acted in a "timely manner" in seeking approval.

"They (Monsanto) can continue to operate as long as they apply for a renewal in a
timely manner," says Shaughnessy. "Since they applied in a timely manner, they are
operating. We are operating as if their license didn't expire."

Monsanto says it has no place to put the waste.

"It's a right-to-operate issue for us," says Monsanto's Mead. "There's no place in
existence that will take this specific waste."

The TNRCC's Rogers concurs.

"They have concentrations (of radioactivity) not allowed at Envirocare," she says.

Under current law, companies outside of the Pacific Northwest have only two
facilities where they can send low-level radioactive waste for disposal -- the
Envirocare site in Utah and the Chemical Nuclear Systems Inc. site in Barnwell, S.C.

Both Envirocare and Barnwell won't accept the waste generated by Monsanto at the
Chocolate Bayou plant, says Mead.

Radioactive and other hazardous waste is generated at the Chocolate Bayou plant,
which produces acrylonitrile, a primary component of acrylic fibers, plastics and
plastic piping.

The radioactive waste results from a spent uranium catalyst used in the production
process.

"It's a proprietary catalyst that has a radioactive element to it," says Monsanto's
Mead. "We're the only ones that use this one. It gives us a competitive edge."

The TNRCC has given a clean bill of health in the past to the Chocolate Bayou plant
site.

"We used to monitor the site until last year. We quit doing the monitoring because
of a budget cut. And we didn't find anything, anyway," says Rogers.

Monsanto won't disclose how much waste has been disposed of over the years, how much
is placed there annually, or the method of disposal.

"It (a discussion about the site) makes an issue out of a nonissue," Mead contends.
"We've been doing this for 30 years under auspices of the regulatory agencies. We're
not interested in getting into a media debate."

From the June 6, 1997 print edition Firm files lawsuit in dispute over radioactive
waste site Ann De Rouffignac

Waste Control Specialists Inc. has filed a $1 billion lawsuit in Andrews County
against Envirocare of Texas. The suit claims Envirocare interfered with WCS's
request to operate a low-level radioactive waste disposal site in West Texas.

The litigation comes on the heels of the U.S. Department of Energy's rejection of a
proposal from WCS for authorization of a low-level and mixed radioactive waste dump
planned for Andrews County.

Pasadena-based WCS had pinned its hopes for huge profits from the DOE's
multibillion-dollar disposal business. (See "Small firm sees bonanza in DOE waste,"
Sept. 6, 1996.)

The federal agency is in the midst of cleaning up nuclear weapons production sites
around the country, generating as much as 50 million cubic yards of mixed and
low-level waste. WCS formally submitted the dump proposal to DOE late last year.

The suit alleges that Envirocare has committed antitrust violations by taking steps
to maintain its monopoly position in the disposal of mixed waste. Envirocare has the
only mixed waste disposal site in the country, the petition asserts.

WCS alleges that Envirocare interfered with the local company's ability to get a
permit with the Department of Health in Texas to store and treat radioactive wastes.

The application requires that a disposal site be named for any waste treated and
stored. So WCS named Envirocare's site in Utah on the application. But WCS alleges
that Envirocare officials told state officials they would not allow WCS to use the
facility -- thus interfering with the firm's ability to do business as a competitor.

The Texas Department of Health, however, will issue a favorable draft decision to
grant WCS a license next week, says Ruth McBurney of the Bureau of Radiation
Control.

The suit also alleges that Envirocare publicized defamatory statements about WCS to
Texas and federal officials, other businesses and the media. The communications were
intended to "injure the reputation and standing of WCS," and prevented government
officials and business leaders from dealing with WCS, the petition states.

"Envirocare spread false and misleading information about us. We are proceeding with
the lawsuit," says Joseph Egan, attorney for WCS.

Envirocare denies all allegations and will fight the lawsuit, says Charles Judd,
president of Envirocare.

"What we have here is a company that failed to gain approval for low-level and mixed
waste disposal, and now wants to blame another company for its own failures," says
Judd.

At the center of the dispute between the two companies is Envirocare's efforts to
establish its own mixed waste and low-level radioactive treatment and disposal site
for federal wastes.

Envirocare purchased land in Andrews County last fall and submitted applications for
permits and licenses to state authorities.

But Envirocare's application for disposal to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission was not processed and returned. The TNRCC said it had no authority to
authorize or regulate a disposal site that accepted federal wastes. The state agency
also said that such a site "under any scenario or arrangement would not be in the
best interests of the state of Texas," according to a letter to Envirocare from Dan
Pearson, executive director of the TNRCC.

In response to the TNRCC decision, Envirocare dropped the disposal part of its
business plan and proceeded with its other permits required to treat and process
federal waste at its Andrews County site, Judd says.

In its petition, WCS calls the Envirocare facility in West Texas a "sham" expressly
undertaken to impose expense, delay and interference on the business activities of
WCS.

From the November 14, 1997 print edition Waste firm wins round against DOE Federal
ruling aids local company, upsets state legislators, stirs up industry Ann De
Rouffignac   Houston Business Journal

A small Houston waste company is taking on the U.S. Department of Energy in a legal
battle that could have a major impact on the disposal of low-level radioactive waste
throughout the country.

Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists Inc. sued the DOE in August, claiming that
the company was unfairly shut out of the competitive bidding process on lucrative
government contracts.

WCS, operator of a hazardous waste site in West Texas, cleared a big legal hurdle
last month when a federal judge ruled that the DOE has the right under the Atomic
Energy Act to put low-level radioactive waste wherever the agency chooses, without a
license from the state.

In addition to aiding the company's cause, the ruling by Judge Joe Kendall of U.S.
District Court in Wichita Falls has stirred up controversy within the waste industry
and among state politicians.

While the DOE has traditionally worked with states concerning the disposal of waste,
the new ruling reinforces the federal agency's right to bypass state authorities in
setting up new low-level radioactive waste sites.

"As it stands now, states cannot license or refuse to license nuclear disposal
facilities for federal waste, and that could open up the entire country," says
Richard Ratliffe, head of the Bureau of Radiation Control for the Texas Department
of Health.

Texas state legislators are not happy about the ruling that could clear the way for
the disposal of DOE waste at the WCS site in West Texas.

"I would strongly oppose placing DOE waste there," says State Rep. Mike Jackson of
Houston, who is vice chairman of the state's legislative Committee on Environmental
Regulation.

"I think that would set a pitiful example for our federal government to do that,"
says Jackson.

Rep. Robert Talton of Pasadena, also a member of the state's environmental
committee, says the state's welfare should be placed before that of the DOE and an
individual company.

"We don't think a federal judge should be interfering or trying to force a federal
agency to do what it usually doesn't," says Talton. "We, as a state, should make
sure that people don't do things for greed and money. They should do the right thing
for Texas."

The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) is also concerned about
the ramifications of the ruling.

"This does not mean we can't have any influence. We won't just stand idly by
regardless of how it is interpreted. We disagree strongly with that. We don't expect
to be shut out of this process and will not rule out any future legal actions,"
warns TNRCC spokesman Patrick Crimmins.

Reaction from the Governor's office is more mild.

"Texas has no role in any decision that the DOE would make -- it is out of our
hands," says Debbie Head, spokeswoman for Governor George W. Bush.

While the stakes are high for Texas, they could be even higher for WCS.

The local company 50-percent owned by Valhi Inc., a publicly held conglomerate
controlled by Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, has been attempting for years to
get a share of the multibillion-dollar waste disposal business.

In 1995, WCS attempted to push through legislation that would change state law and
allow private companies to dispose of commercial radioactive waste in Texas, which
is currently forbidden under the Health and Safety Code of Texas.

When that effort failed, WCS changed course and began seeking federal radioactive
waste.

"When we failed to change the state law, we got smarter and looked at federal waste
exempt from state law," said Kenneth Bigham, chief executive officer of WCS, in a
previous interview with Houston Business Journal (see "Small firm seeks bonanza in
DOE waste," Sept. 6, 1996).

In December of 1996, the TNRCC rejected a request by WCS to regulate the West Texas
facility for the disposal of federal waste, claiming that Texas statutes prohibit
the agency from licensing or overseeing a private company that disposes of
radioactive waste, no matter what the source.

WCS then shifted gears and went directly to the DOE by submitting an unsolicited
proposal in late December of 1996. The proposal "sought DOE authorization of its
Texas facility as a disposal site for waste from DOE's stalled weapons complex clean
up," according to a company press release.

After rejecting this proposal in May, the DOE refused to consider a bid by WCS to
dispose of low-level radioactive waste from Ohio at the company's West Texas
facility, claiming that WCS did not have a site licensed by the state to handle such
waste.

WCS responded by filing a lawsuit in federal court seeking a preliminary injunction
to prohibit the DOE from awarding any contracts. WCS argued that a state license is
not required for disposal of federal radioactive waste under the Atomic Energy Act.

Judge Kendall agreed and also questioned the federal bidding process in his report,
writing that "the fix is in." Apparently, Envirocare of Utah Inc. (also the target
of a WCS lawsuit; see chronological chart on Page 18) is the only private company
ever to receive a contract from the DOE to dispose of low-level radioactive waste.

A lawyer for WCS says the judge's decision gives the company new life.

"The ruling means that we are back in business for DOE disposal contracts; we have a
site that's well suited for radioactive waste," says attorney John Kyte with Egan &
Associates of Washington D.C. "What we want is competition for those wastes that DOE
ships off-site to commercial facilities."

The ruling has become a matter of debate in the trade media.

Nuclear Waste News ran a story concerning the case on Oct. 17, which was followed by
an article in Hazardous Waste News three days later.

Even Investors Business Daily editorialized on the subject of WCS and the DOE
radioactive waste contracts on Oct. 15. The publication noted that the issue means
big business for the waste industry because "the job of cleaning up Energy
Department facilities used to produce nuclear weapons in the Cold War has been
priced at hundreds of billions of dollars."

In a hearing on the WCS lawsuit, former DOE official Martin Malsch testified that
the total cost of federal radioactive waste disposal could reach $1 trillion over
the next 10 to 15 years.

Environmentalists in and out of Texas have been following the issue closely.

"The ruling says very clearly that the state has little to say about where these
sites are," says Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of Texas Public Citizen, a consumer
and environmental watchdog group.

Even groups in New Mexico have been paying close attention.

"Texans should be concerned about a lot of waste coming in from other parts of the
country," says Don Hancock, director of Southwest Research & Information Center, a
nonprofit environmental research organization in Albuquerque. "This is a growth
industry, and private companies will want to get in on it. Anyone who can will. And
Texas looks pretty good."

So far, the DOE has remained silent on the ruling.

The agency has not appealed or filed anything other than an answer in response to
the WCS suit. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for the end of November.

But government officials say it's now possible that the DOE may change past policy
and wield more power in the future.

"A year ago, they (DOE) would have looked at states where they could seek a path of
least resistance. But now it's possible DOE might seek as yet unknown places and use
its authority under the AEA (Atomic Energy Act) to self-regulate," says Dwayne
Weigel, assistant director of civilian and DOE waste management at the General
Accounting Office.

Whatever the eventual outcome, the small Houston company has succeeded in attracting
national attention.

"A year ago, nobody was talking about the WCS situation," says Weigel. "Now, this
same situation is causing issues to emerge concerning what is the authority of the
DOE under the Atomic Energy Act anyway?"

Warning of Excess Capacity In Nation's Nuclear Dumps. The New York
Times,
December 7,
1997, pA36.
     Some planned nuclear waste disposal sites may be unnecessary and
could
sink the
industry, according to an economist.
     The nation's three current dumps for low-level radiation will
have
excess capacity well
into the next century, said Gregory Hayden, a professor at the
University
of Nebraska.
     A new dump, such as the Ward Valley project in southeastern
California
could  mean the
end for the economically struggling disposal sites, Hayden said.
     "If it's opened, it will break the system that the rest of the
nation
depends on," said
Hayden. "They're already in trouble because of the trickle of waste."
     In a report last month at the National Conference of State
Legislatures, Hayden presented
a report that said that the annual volume of low-level waste shipped
to
disposal sites dropped
from 3.8 million cubic feet in 1980 to 422,000 cubic feet in 1996.
     Hayden attributed the excess capacity to waste reduction via
recycling
and new
compacting technologies.

================== Houston Biz Journal From the April 3, 1998 print edition Attorney
general takes action in radioactive waste dispute State challenges federal court
ruling on DOE disposal process Ann De Rouffignac   Houston Business Journal

The state Attorney General has finally intervened in a two-year-old dispute between
a Houston company and the U.S. Department of Energy over the disposal of radioactive
waste at a site in West Texas.

In a filing last week with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the
Attorney General's office argued that the DOE should not be allowed to evade state
jurisdiction in the disposal of radioactive waste at privately owned sites.

Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists Inc. is seeking a way to dispose of DOE
waste at the company's Andrews County site without a state license or a permit. The
DOE would not allow the company to bid on contracts without a state-licensed
radioactive disposal site.

Waste Control sued the DOE in a federal district court in Wichita Falls last fall,
saying the company was unfairly excluded from the bidding process. The district
court ruled in the company's favor. (See "Waste firm wins round against DOE" Nov.
14, 1997).

DOE appealed the ruling and the case is now pending in federal appeals court.

The stakes are huge for the small waste company. The DOE has billions of dollars of
low-level and mixed radioactive waste at facilities throughout the nation. The
agency is under the gun to clean up these sites and dispose of millions of tons of
waste.

Waste Control already has state and federal permits to dispose of industrial
hazardous waste at the company's West Texas site and has also obtained a state
health permit required to process and treat radioactive waste at its facilities in
Andrews County. The only missing link is authorization to dispose of federal
radioactive waste on a permanent basis.

The federal district court ruling put Waste Control one step closer to obtaining DOE
contracts for disposal of radioactive waste in Texas. The ruling, if upheld, would
allow the company to bypass the state permitting process and compete for federal
contracts to dispose of waste in West Texas.

Until now, state officials have remained neutral in the dispute despite the fact
that the waste would end up in Texas and could allow other private sites to operate
without state permits.

The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the state agency in charge of
protecting the environment, has claimed it has no jurisdiction in granting or
denying any license involving the disposal of federal radioactive waste.

Meanwhile, the lower court ruling in Wichita Falls has attracted considerable
attention in other states.

Congressional delegations from Washington and Oregon wrote to the DOE last month,
citing the Waste Control case and the profound implications that this ruling could
have on national radioactive waste practices. These members of Congress were
unanimous in urging that the ruling be overturned.

Attorney general offices in 16 other states filed briefs in New Orleans circuit
court challenging the ruling before Texas followed suit last week.

In a 21-page document submitted to the court, Texas Attorney general Dan Morales
summed up the state's position by stating:

"Sound public policy dictates that the DOE not be allowed to evade state
jurisdiction under the guise of self-regulation while disposing of its radioactive
waste at privately owned and operated waste disposal facilities. Public policy
requires that all wastes generated by DOE be subject to independent oversight and
enforcement preferably by qualified state regulatory agencies."

From the May 22, 1998 print edition Houson firm loses legal round in federal waste
disposal fight Court reverses earlier decision, WCS will seek rehearing Ann De
Rouffignac   Houston Business Journal

Waste Control Specialists Inc. has lost a legal round in federal appeals court that
could have paved the way for the Pasadena company to dispose of low-level
radioactive waste in West Texas without state approval.

Last week, the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans reversed
and dismissed a federal district court decision handed down in Wichita Falls last
fall that would allow WCS to bid for radioactive waste disposal contracts from the
U.S. Department of Energy without having a state-approved disposal site.

"We will seek a rehearing in the Fifth Circuit within the legal time limit," says
John Kyte, attorney for WCS. "This is not the end by any means. We are in this for
the long haul."

WCS has been battling for more than two years to get the billion-dollar business of
disposing of federal low-level radioactive waste at the company's site in Andrews
County. The existing waste site has state and federal licenses to dispose of
hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The company also received a state permit to treat
and handle huge volumes of radioactive waste at the site, but not to dispose of the
waste.

WCS sued the DOE in federal court seeking to stop the federal agency from granting
waste disposal contracts to other companies without allowing WCS to bid. The company
alleged that the DOE was unfairly denying its right to bid because it didn't have
state approval for disposing of waste in Andrews County.

WCS argued that it didn't need state approval or regulation to accept DOE waste.
Federal law allows the DOE to choose any site it deems appropriate for such disposal
without state involvement. In the past, however, the DOE has always sought state
cooperation in the disposal of low-level radioactive waste.

After the Wichita Falls judge granted the injunction, the DOE appealed the case to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.

State attorney generals from 16 states, including Texas, filed briefs in the New
Orleans court in March challenging the Wichita Falls district court ruling.

Although these briefs were not accepted by the court, the circuit judges reversed
the injunction and and ordered the lawsuit filed by WCS against the DOE dismissed.

Houston Biz Journal From the March 5, 1999 print edition Nuclear plants contract
with WCS to store waste at West Texas site Agreement with STP, Texas Utilities
awaits approval of Legislature Ann De Rouffignac

The South Texas Project and Texas Utilities signed a contract last month with Waste
Control Specialists of Pasadena to dispose of low level radioactive waste at a site
in West Texas.

Waste Control's agreement with the STP and TU, which owns the Comanche Peak nuclear
plant, offers a huge discount to the nuclear plants, which have been sending their
waste to Barnwell in South Carolina, the only other facility that can accept it.
Waste Control will sell disposal services to the nuclear plants for an all-inclusive
price of $40 per cubic foot, says John Kyte, the company's attorney. The facility at
Barnwell now charges about $350 to $400 a cubic foot for disposal, depending on the
type of waste.

Before the contract is effective, the Texas Legislature must pass a bill clearing
the way for Waste Control's dump.

Although Kyte says WCS can make a profit at the $40 price, others say the company
must get more volume of waste from out-of-state to make a decent rate of return on
the $50 million investment in the Andrews County site.

WCS is still trying to import Department of Energy radioactive waste for processing
and disposal at the Andrews County site, and the potential profit in disposing of
that waste is enormous. Industry sources value that agency's disposal costs in the
billions of dollars.

So far, however, WCS has been unable to land any DOE contracts because the company
did not have a disposal permit for low level radioactive waste from the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Under the State Health and Safety Code,
radioactive waste in Texas can only be disposed of in the proposed state-owned site
in Hudspeth County.

Now an effort in the Legislature would turn over the disposal of the waste to
private enterprise. Sponsored by Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine, the bill changes the
code to allow a private company to dispose of the waste and removes Hudspeth County
as the official site.

The bill also calls for the state to take title to the waste and the site. Opponents
of the bill say that gives all the profits to a private company and leaves taxpayers
responsible for any environmental or health problems down the line.
Environmentalists also say the legislation would clear the way for Andrews County to
become a national dumping ground for radioactive waste.

Kyte says WCS is solving a problem for the nuclear plants in Texas.

"It gets the job done and solves a problem. Barnwell is exorbitantly high-priced,"
he says.

U.S. judge opens way for plutonium shipment

REUTERS USA: December 20, 1999

Michigan. - A federal judge cleared the way for the shipment of
plutonium from Los Alamos, New Mexico, to Canada by refusing to grant an
injunction to groups who say the move would break U.S. law.

The order from U.S. District Judge Richard Alan Enslen in the Western
District of Michigan also vacates a temporary restraining order that he
issued on Dec. 7. The restraining order expires on Friday at 5:30 p.m.
(2230 GMT)

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) plans to truck nine fuel rods
containing 119 grams of plutonium some 3,300 miles (5,280 km) through
several states to an experimental reactor in Chalk River, Canada.

The plutonium is at the centre of the Parallex Project, an experimental
programme between the United States and Russia to dispose of fuel from
dismantled nuclear weapons. The U.S. plutonium will be combined with
nine rods from Russia and converted into nuclear reactor fuel.

In a lawsuit filed Dec. 6 in federal court in Kalamazoo, Michigan,
opponents of the effort said the Energy Department's plans violated the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and did not fully consider the
environmental risks.

The programme has also met resistance in Canada, where opponents fear
their country will be turned into a dumping ground for nuclear waste. In
addition to environmentalists, police and firefighters' associations
have protested the shipment and Native American groups have threatened
nonviolent actions to block the route.

Alice Hirt, a Holland, Michigan, resident and one of the plaintiffs in
the Michigan lawsuit, said on Friday that the opponents' attorneys were
reviewing their options following Enslen's ruling.

"For (DOE) to move ahead at this point flies in the face of the
nonproliferation policy in this country, which has been in place for
decades," she said.

In his ruling, Enslen said opponents are likely to win on their NEPA
violation claims.

But he noted that the Parallex Project came out of talks between
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin and that
courts should avoid interfering with U.S. foreign policy.

"In the absence of overwhelming evidence by the plaintiffs demonstrating
that the executive's foreign policy assessment is not credible or
mistaken, the court must conclude that American nonproliferation
interests would be harmed if the court were to issue an injunction,"
Enslen said.

DOE officials said they were pleased by the decision, which will "allow
the Energy Department to proceed with this important nonproliferation
initiative." A spokeswoman said in response to concerns expressed by
lawmakers, the DOE has taken additional safety steps including using
specially designed vehicles.

It was unclear when the plutonium will be transported. Hirt said DOE
officials have said their deadline is Friday for starting the trip. DOE
officials said Friday a date has not been set.

Officials also refused to disclose the exact route for security reasons.
Previous documents from the DOE indicated the shipment could pass
through Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana before reaching
Michigan.

Once in Michigan, the fuel would cross the Mackinac Bridge into
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, then enter Canada at Sault Ste. Marie.

	Alice Stewart Interview: A-Bomb Data Wrongly Interpreted

Alice Stewart, A Pioneering Heroine, discovered that 
low level radiation caused more health damage
than previously thought, and spent a life-time
devoted to clarifying and sharing this critical 
information.....

The Survivor

In the 1950s, Alice Stewart found that exposing
pregnant mothers to X-rays doubled the risk of
cancer in their children. Ever since, the
physician and epidemiologist has argued that low
doses of radiation might be harmful. It's a view
that has put her at odds with governments, the
military and the nuclear industry. This week,
Stewart, who is 93, publishes new research
supporting her claims. Michael Bond spoke to the
maverick of radiation epidemiology and found her
in fighting form.

What new evidence do you have to support your
claims that low-level radiation could be
dangerous?

Radiation safety standards are derived from
studies of the A-bomb survivors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. These studies were food for people
supporting hormesis, the theory that a little bit
of radiation can be good for you--that it
stimulates the immune system. When it was found
that a small number of the A-bomb survivors were
living longer than they ought to, this was seen as
proof that radiation had done them good. But we
have new data that should put paid to that. We
have proof that the A-bomb data have been wrongly
interpreted. (See "Radiation: how safe is safe?")

What does your research show?

It shows that cancer was not the only effect of
the A-bomb radiation. People died from immune
system damage as well. Our paper also shows that
the A-bomb survivors were not a normal, homogenous
population. They were the best athletes--the top
10 per cent--and did not include the young and the
old. This means that we cannot base standards of
radiation safety on such an elite cohort.

Do you think that the authorities will now
reassess the idea that radiation at low doses is
not harmful?

I think this new paper will do it. But I don't
think it will lead to an immediate reaction.

Why do you think your findings always take so long
to be taken seriously? Take your work in the 1950s
showing that a fetus exposed to X-rays has a
higher risk of cancer. Or your findings in the
1970s that workers at the Hanford weapons complex
in the US were getting cancer after supposedly
safe levels of exposure.

The trouble is that I've always had a very small
set-up, with only just enough money to employ
people to do the research. I've never had a
department that's out selling the message to other
people. So it's been a bit slower than usual.

When it came to my work on X-rays, nobody wanted
to believe it. X-rays were a favourite toy of the
medical profession. But much more than that, it
was just the moment when the nuclear industry was
taking off. If we were right, the industry
couldn't develop properly.

Your work has tended to attract a lot of criticism
from scientists, one of whom is the leading
epidemiologist Richard Doll. Why do you think he
doesn't like your work?

I moved to Birmingham University for that reason.
I knew that if I stayed at Oxford I would always
be under the thumb of Doll. But that is the
extraordinary thing. I can have reason to be angry
with him because he was powerful and I was weak.
He can have no reason at all to be angry at me,
and yet he must resent me for some reason.
Something irks him about me, and I'm conceited
enough to think he suspects I'm a better
epidemiologist than him. Now, he will tell you he
has never had any quarrel with me at all.

Doll has criticised your methodology on the
Hanford Studies. Why?

He's criticised my methodology from the word go. I
don't know why. He's even criticised the
mathematics of George Kneale, my statistician. But
Doll doesn't know a fraction of the mathematics
that George knows. I don't know what he means when
he says our method is wrong, but he should be
called to account.

The main objections to my X-rays study was that
the mothers were lay informants --that they
weren't scientists, and they could have made up
stories. We always knew there were weaknesses in
our story. But we'd done our best to check this
through the hospitals where they had their X-rays.

You've been described as "an avowed opponent of
the nuclear industry". Are you?

Well, I've never avowed it to anybody. But if by
the nuclear industry you mean the war and energy
industries, then yes I'm against it. If you mean,
do I think we should stop using X-rays, then no,
but you must use them knowing they are a dangerous
toy. I think the medical profession has quite a
lot of uses for it. Take, for example, irradiated
food. If this was going to prolong the life of
food that you could send to a country to save it
from starving, it would be excellent. But what
you've got to be careful of is not to allow
industry to indiscriminately use this radiation
and to find it's going down your back drains.

I'm automatically against it for war, and you have
to remember that the nuclear military and energy
industries have always been far more intimately
connected than most people realise.

The discovery that made your name in 1956 was that
a fetus exposed to an X-ray is twice as likely to
develop cancer within 10 years as one that is not.
Did this finding come as a complete surprise to
you?

Yes. We weren't particularly looking for a link
between cancer and X-rays. We were comparing the
medical records of children who had died from
leukaemia with those of healthy children from the
same regions. And in the questionnaire, we had
asked mothers if they'd been X-rayed. It looked to
me as if there had been something before birth
that produced a little epidemic at a certain age
group that never repeated itself. But the risk was
so small that if we'd tackled it any other way
we'd never have discovered it.

We were lucky, but it wouldn't have been thought
of by someone who hadn't had some experience of
medicine, and it might have been wrongly
interpreted.  So if you hadn't found the link it
might have been another 20 years before someone
else did?

No, not 20 years. To this day we would be thinking
X-rays were safe. This is because, as I've
indicated, the A-bomb survivor studies from
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was the only other
study on this, was saying it was safe, and this
would have been considered satisfactory to the
point where everybody would have been quite happy
about X-rays.

How much do you think being a woman helped or
hindered your career? When you first walked into
the lecture hall as a medical student at Cambridge
in 1925 you were met with 200 male students
stamping their feet at you.

I'm sure my sex made a tremendous difference. But
thanks to my family--my mother was a doctor--and
thanks to the war, rather than being a crippling
difficulty it actually proved to be rather a
helpful one. I found I was constantly thinking of
things in an unusual way. I didn't expect to be
allowed to get to the top rung, which is something
a man would expect, and so perhaps that made it
easier to stay with a subject that wasn't very
popular.

Has that bothered you?

Not at the time, but in retrospect I think it's
the one thing I rather regret . . . that I should
have pressed for something more. But I was stuck,
I could only do one or other of two things: I
could either be fighting the battle for women or I
could be getting on with my job. I couldn't win
both. And I chose to go on with my job. But I
think a braver person might have done something
about it.

Were you ever bitter about being sidelined?

No, I think I personally had everything to gain by
it. It's always worked in my favour. An element of
uncertainty is always a good thing. It's been a
constant help. You need some resistance and
criticism to bring out the good work. One of the
reasons it's been so interesting for me is that no
one has ever lost interest in what I've said about
radiation. They may despise me, they may hate me,
but the problem is there and will stay there if
nobody's solved it.

Most people think about cutting back on work when
they reach seventy. Did you miss out on anything
by carrying on in your nineties?

I stayed working because I was enjoying it, and it
was all voluntary. It became obvious early on that
we had hit on something that was going to take
more than a lifetime to resolve. It wasn't just
the radiation thing that interested me. I was
really interested in where the other cancers were
coming from. You need to follow it for a long
time.

Who will carry on your fight in the radiation
debate?

I've got a voice in the next generation in Steve
Wing and his department at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Mind you, they're going
to make life difficult for them, with grants and
everything. People in the nuclear industry will do
their very best to stop it. But I'm a great
believer that in the end, they'll get caught up in
their own machinations and the truth will emerge
from an unexpected quarter.

Radiation: how safe is safe?

The A-bomb database--a record of the health and
mortality of the survivors of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki atomic bombs--is considered the gold
standard when assessing the health risks of
radiation. Alice Stewart, however, has spent much
of her career arguing that it cannot be trusted.
Her latest research, published this week in the
International Journal of Epidemiology (vol 29, no
4), strengthens that argument.

 The database is used to compare the mortality
rates of A-bomb survivors with other Japanese
citizens born at the same time. The results have
always been the same: people exposed to low doses
do not have a higher than average risk of cancer.
Stewart says these conclusions are unreliable
because the bomb survivors are not truly
representative of Japanese society.

In her latest paper, she focuses on the 2600
people who suffered severeradiation injuries even
though most received only a small radiation dose.
In particular, she wanted to compare their
incidence of cancers and other diseases with that
of around 60 000 low-dose survivors who did not
suffer from serious injuries.

Stewart found the minority group had a much higher
incidence of cancer and heart disease. She says
these findings were reported to the European
Parliament two years ago (see New Scientist, 28
February 1998, p 12) but that the assembly,
curiously, decided not to make them public.

Stewart's detractors have pointed to a series of
studies showing that certain survivors of the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs lived slightly longer
than people who had not been exposed.

But research published in The Lancet (vol 356, p
303) at the end of last month casts doubt on these
results. Researchers from the Radiation Effects
Research Foundation in Hiroshima examined the
effects of radiation on the 120 000 A-bomb
survivors and found that people who received low
doses did not live longer than average.

Low-level nuke waste storage - an idea not dead in Ohio
Appalachian Focus Environmental News

Low-level nuke waste storage - an idea not dead in Ohio
By Randall Edwards

Private companies might be given the chance to do what politicians couldn't
manage -- find a place to store Ohio's low-level radioactive trash from nuclear
power plants, hospitals and research labs.

The Ohio Department of Health is preparing regulations that anticipate the sort
of proposal that already has been floated in Texas -- a "temporary" storage
depot where radioactive waste could be stored for up to 100 years. The
regulations are being prepared in Ohio by the health department's Radiation
Advisory Council and will be ready for public review by this autumn, said Roger
Suppes, chief of the health department's Bureau of Radiation Protection.

Suppes stressed that no company has come looking for permission to store the
low-level waste. And environmental activists predict that the regulations will
face statewide political opposition. But industry experts believe that these
depots, known as "assured isolation facilities," will be necessary if the two
existing low-level waste dumps in the U.S. shut down or stop accepting
out-of-state wastes. "What this discussion is about is having a facility that
would store, for an extended period of time, low-level radioactive waste,"
Suppes said. "We're looking at developing standards so that if a commercial
organization wanted to propose one, we'd know what to do."

Low-level waste comes from nuclear power plants, hospitals, research
laboratories and factories, and is made up of solid waste that has been
contaminated. This includes clothing and equipment, such as booties, gloves and
syringes from hospitals, or tools used in power plants. It also includes resin
filters used in power plants, but it does not include spent nuclear fuel rods
or other highly radioactive waste.

The debate over what to do with this material is quiet now, but it was raging
less than a decade ago, when one of the few available disposal sites, in
Barnwell, S.C., was threatening to close its doors to out-of-state wastes.

Ohio joined with six other states to develop a large waste repository that
would be financed by fees on waste generators. It was called the Midwest
Compact, one of several similar compacts throughout the country. And, like the
rest of the compacts, it failed to overcome political opposition to nuclear
waste.

Plans called for Michigan to accept the compact's waste for 20 years, and then
pass on the responsibility to another state. But Michigan bowed to opposition
and backed out. The compact then spent more than $5 million trying to identify
a site in Ohio, but abandoned the project in 1997, despite support from Ohio's
political leadership.

At the time, Ohio's waste generators said there was no need to panic. But last
year, South Carolina reached a long-term agreement with New Jersey and
Connecticut, and announced that after 2008, Barnwell would no longer accept
wastes from other states. The nation's only other low-level disposal site is
Envirocare's site in Utah and it cannot accept some radioactive wastes.

"Low-level radioactive waste disposal is a moving target," Suppes said. "If
Envirocare were to shut down, and Barnwell has already cut its capacity by 50
percent, we'd need something else."

The proposed new rules assume that this facility would be privately operated,
possibly by a consortium of waste generators. Suppes compared it to a
"rent-a-warehouse" for radioactive waste. He said most of the waste would
likely go to regular landfills after leaving the site: most of the waste that
would have gone to the previously proposed waste dump has short-lived
radioactivity and would decay to the point of natural background radiation
within 100 years. He did not rule out the possibility that such a site could
take waste from out-of-state generators.

There may not be much demand for this kind of depot from the atomic energy
industry, said Todd Schneider of First Energy, which operates three nuclear
power plants, including Davis-Besse in Port Clinton and the Perry plant in
Perry, Ohio.

"There was some talk about this a couple of years ago but since then we haven't
heard much," he said. Most of the company's waste ends up in Utah after waste
minimization in Tennessee, he said. The waste that has a high level of
radioactivity but is still classified as low-level waste must go to Barnwell
because it is not accepted in Utah.

Power plants have greatly reduced their waste to save disposal costs, Schneider
said. In 1991 First Energy plants produced 16,000 cubic feet of waste. Last
year, less than 2,500 cubic feet were produced.

But if Utah and South Carolina stop accepting waste, the proposal may take on
more urgency, said Craig Jensen, the radiation safety officer at Battelle, a
Columbus-based research lab.

Jensen said assured isolation facilities is an idea catching on throughout the
country, and added that Ohio's regulatory effort was triggered by "a few
nibbles from companies" a couple of years ago.

"The idea is, rather than have small amounts of waste in many different
locations with different controls, we'd have a central place to store it," he
said.

Harvey Wasserman, an anti-nuclear activist with Greenpeace who led the charge
against the Midwest Compact effort, said a proposal to privatize low-level
radioactive waste storage or disposal would lead to public outcry. "I think
people are going to be pretty angry about this," Wasserman said. "It seems like
a way to circumvent public opinion and backdoor the waste dump that people all
across the state were opposed to. I think it's pretty cynical."

A similar proposal has led to controversy this year in the Texas state
legislature, which failed, in the waning days of the session just ended, to
approve a law that would allow assured isolation facilities. The law passed the
Senate over noisy protest by demonstrators, but failed when it could not be
brought to a final House floor vote. The bill was inspired by a request by a
west Texas company, which operates a licensed hazardous waste site and wanted
to become a repository for low-level radioactive waste.

Despite the bill's failure, Texas remains headed toward an assured isolation
depot, said Kenneth Peddicord, a professor of Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M
University. "I think we're moving in that direction," he said. "There has been
some statewide opposition, but generally I think there is greater public
acceptance of a monitored site that leaves future options open."

STP nuclear plant ups security measures
Monica Perin   Houston Business Journal

The South Texas Project nuclear power plant near Bay City was on a "heightened
state of awareness" and took "necessary precautions as required by our
procedures," according to plant manager Alan Mikus.

Those security procedures are confidential but do not require closing down the
plant, which was operating at 100 percent capacity, he said.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent security advisories to all 103
nuclear power plants in the U.S. Tuesday directing them to activate their
highest security procedures, although a NRC spokesman said the agency knew of
no specific threats to any nuclear facilities.

Such "heightened awareness" and security procedures previously were initiated
at the nuclear facility during the 1990-91 Gulf War and following the Oklahoma
City bombing in 1996.

The concrete containment buildings in which nuclear reactions take place in
U.S. nuclear power plants are designed to withstand direct impact of a 747 jet
plane, the NRC spokesman said.

The NRC adopted more stringent security measures for nuclear power plants
following the first bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 1993. The
measures require that the plants protect against trucks and four-wheel drive
vehicles carrying bombs.

STP is owned jointly by Reliant HL&P, City Public Service, the city of Austin
and Central Power & Light in Corpus Christi.

Fitch Places Valhi And NL Debt Rtgs On Rating Watch Negative.
Author/s:
Issue: Sept 25, 2001
Business Editors & Analysts
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 25, 2001
Fitch has placed Valhi's senior unsecured and senior secured debt rating
of 'BB-' and NL Industries' (NL) 'BB' senior secured rating on Rating
Watch Negative pending further developments in the transaction proposed
Sept. 19, 2001 to exchange NL shares of common stock for newly issued
shares of common stock and debt securities of Titanium Metals
Corporation (TIMET).

The Rating Watch Negative status is based on concerns relating to NL
being burdened by the relatively weak financial condition of potential
parent company TIMET, the potential for the issuance of additional debt
securities at the TIMET level and the potential structural subordination
of Valhi to NL through TIMET. If the proposed transaction is approved,
the ratings of Valhi and NL could potentially be downgraded by more than
one notch.

Valhi announced Sept. 21, 2001 they will not approve any transaction
that may be negotiated with an independent committee of TIMET's Board of
Directors and its advisors without the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares voting that are held by persons other than Valhi, Tremont and
their affiliates.

Valhi Inc. is a holding company with ownership stakes in NL Industries;
a producer of titanium dioxide pigments, CompX; a producer of locks and
ball bearing slides serving the office furniture industry, TIMET; a
producer of titanium metals products, and Waste Control Specialists; a
provider of hazardous waste disposal services.

Civilian nuclear plants might get military role
U.S. plan for making bomb material tritium reverses earlier policies

The United States, which for decades has urged other countries not to
use commercial nuclear power plants as factories for nuclear bomb
materials, is taking steps to do just that.

The Bush administration - continuing a project begun under President
Bill Clinton - in recent weeks has advanced a plan to use one or more
commercial nuclear plant reactors in Tennessee to produce tritium, a
radioactive substance that boosts the power of nuclear weapons.

It would be the first time that the United States, the world's first and
strongest nuclear power, has made civilian nuclear plants part of the
vast complex that produces and maintains the nuclear arsenal.

U.S. officials have said they need new tritium, which the government has
not produced since an outmoded federal facility closed in 1988, to
restore old weapons and make new ones. They say that security at the
first nuclear power plant designated for the project - the Tennessee
Valley Authority's Watts Bar plant, 10 miles south of Spring City, Tenn.
- will keep the material safe.

But critics say abandoning the long-standing separation of commercial
and military nuclear programs could encourage other countries to do the
same - putting weapons in more hands, increasing the risk of nuclear
theft and terrorism, and destroying international confidence in
nuclear-weapons treaties.

Security concerns have increased since the Sept. 11 attacks in New York
and Washington, with nuclear facilities on heightened alert against
possible terrorist assaults.

"Pakistan has nuclear weapons now, and North Korea, Iraq and Iran are on
the edge of that decision," said physicist Kenneth Bergeron, who spent
25 years at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.,
researching reactor safety and tritium production for the federal
laboratory that researches national security.

"They might just say that if the United States is doing this, then the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty is history," said Dr. Bergeron, who
retired in 1999.

Officials with the National Nuclear Security Administration, a
semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that
produces and maintains nuclear weapons, did not respond to interview
requests over the past several days. A spokesman left a message after
the close of business Monday, saying he would not be available to
discuss the project until later in the week.

Federal officials have maintained that folding commercial nuclear power
plants into the nuclear weapons business would not threaten world
stability. In a 1998 report to Congress, the Energy Department said that
concerns about whether the tritium proposal would spread nuclear weapons
technology abroad were "manageable."

Starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" program
to promote nonmilitary nuclear technology, eight successive presidents
said that blurring the line between civilian and military nuclear uses
was a bad idea because it might hasten the global spread of nuclear
weapons.

The United States encouraged other countries to follow the American
example and not combine civilian nuclear energy and nuclear weapons
programs.

In late 1998, however, the Clinton administration reversed that policy,
announcing that the supply of new tritium for U.S. nuclear weapons would
come from commercial nuclear reactors in Tennessee. The other option,
which Energy Secretary Bill Richardson rejected as too expensive, was to
build a new facility for defense use only.

Since then, federal agencies have worked to implement that decision,
issuing bid requests and breaking ground on a new facility to extract
the tritium at the Energy Department's Savannah River Site in South
Carolina. Most recently, the TVA, a federally owned commercial utility,
asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Aug. 20 for a license
amendment that would let the Watts Bar plant start producing tritium for
bombs along with power for its customers.

The TVA's two-reactor Sequoyah plant, nine miles northeast of
Chattanooga, also could become a tritium factory.

Rejected plan

Under the plan that the government rejected, the tritium would have been
produced at a new facility in South Carolina designed just for that
purpose, with state-of-the-art safety features.

Tritium is necessary to boost a conventional nuclear bomb into a much
more powerful hydrogen bomb. Every nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal
uses tritium. But because the gas decays at a rate of 5.5 percent per
year, older weapons eventually must have new supplies added. New weapons
also require tritium.

Recent Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety reviews of TVA's Watts Bar
and Sequoyah nuclear plants have given them generally good marks, but
critics say the unusual design of the TVA reactors makes them inherently
inferior.

Dr. Bergeron said he worries that national security and Energy
Department budgetary priorities, not reactor safety, will become
paramount at Watts Bar and Sequoyah.

"We're adding a mission to these TVA plants," he said. "It's a conflict
of interest. I worry about people looking the other way. I worry about
the [Energy Department] cutting corners."

TVA officials did not respond to interview requests.

Mark Padovan, project manager for the NRC's review of the plan, said
nuclear regulators will ask only narrow technical questions. Under an
agreement with the Energy Department, the NRC will not raise any
questions about the broader policy questions involving dual-use
technology.

But opponents say such questions are crucial. They say that the spread
of technology for producing tritium in nuclear power plants could help
fledgling nuclear powers build more dangerous bombs.

"We know that Pakistan is trying to boost its weapons," Dr. Bergeron
said. "India is probably doing it, too. This accelerates that process."

A "boosted" bomb can be lighter and smaller, he said, making it easier
to transport and deliver - or steal.

It's also true that terrorists might steal an old, poorly guarded weapon
and obtain tritium and boost it," Dr. Bergeron said.

Missing Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods Declared Mistakenly Shipped and Disposed
   (source: AP; 16 January 2002) 
   Inspectors from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced on 15 January
   that two radioactive fuel rods that have been missing for some 20 years from the
   Millstone Nuclear Complex located in Waterford, Connecticut were likely mistaken for
   other radioactive waste and disposed. The NRC stated that fuel rods have never before
   gone missing in the history of US commercial nuclear power plants and it is
   considering whether to sanction or fine Dominion, Inc., which owns the Millstone One
   nuclear power plant for lapses in record-keeping and mishandling of highly
   radioactive spent nuclear fuel. The investigation regarding the missing fuel rods
   began in December 2000 after Northeast Utilities (NU), the owner of plant until last
   year, conducted an inventory of the plant's spent nuclear fuel. Neither NU or
   Dominion, Inc. could determine conclusively where the rods were.

   The NRC and Dominion insist that rods could not have been stolen because anyone
   removing them would have had to use proper equipment and would have had to get past
   numerous radiation monitors and security measures. Both agreed that the rods were
   most likely shipped to and stored at Barnwell, South Carolina or Hanford, Washington.
   Officials at the Barnwell site are upset that the spent fuel rods may have been
   shipped to them and stored in violation of their license without their knowledge.
   Barnwell is refusing to accept any further radioactive waste from Millstone One until
   the spent fuel rods are found.

   Millstone One is in the process of being decommissioned and has not operated since
   1995. Two other reactors at the Millstone Nuclear Complex are still in operation.
   Dominion inherited the missing fuel rod problem when it purchased the Millstone
   Nuclear Complex last year from the Berlin-based NU for $1.3 billion. NU advised
   Dominion before the sale of the missing rods and paid more than $9 million to
   investigate. According to Joe Besade, an anti-nuclear activist, NU has paid $10
   million in penalties in the past for violating nuclear and clean-water regulations.

Fitch Ratings Affirms Valhi & NL Industries' Debt Ratings.
Author/s:
Issue: March 26, 2002
Business Editors
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 26, 2002
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Valhi's senior unsecured and senior secured
debt rating of 'BB-' and NL Industries' (NL) senior secured rating of
'BB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Valhi and NL credit statistics were strong for the rating level again in
2001 and are expected to remain strong near-term given modest debt
levels and the outlook for titanium dioxide profitability in the coming
year. Net debt levels at the Valhi level have remained low in 2001 and
so far in 2002. At Dec. 31, 2001, Valhi cash and securities exceeded
$200 million, while gross debt was $608 million. Valhi's $250 million
Snake River bonds, included in gross debt, are offset by an equity
interest in, and a note receivable from, the Snake River Sugar Company.
Valhi's EBITDA for 2001 was $309 million (2001 EBITDA $262 net of a
securities gains) against gross interest of about $62 million.

While Valhi and NL's current credit statistics are fairly strong for the
rating, Fitch expects that at some point Valhi might pursue an
acquisition or a restructuring transaction that could significantly
change the credit profile of Valhi and/or NL. For example Valhi recently
pursued a transaction that would have exchanged a portion of its stake
in NL for a stake in Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET), in the process
structurally subordinating Valhi to TIMET.

Titanium dioxide industry profitability is related to capacity
utilization rates. Titanium dioxide prices were on a positive trend in
2000 before declining in 2001 as cyclically sensitive demand declined.
Fitch's 2002 outlook is for demand to stabilize and to start to trend
back upwards, possibly leading to increasing prices by the end of the
year. Overall operating income for NL should be flat to slightly down in
2002.

NL is named in a variety of lead paint related lawsuits initiated by the
State of Rhode Island, the City of Milwaukee and other cities. Several
other former lead pigment producers are also named in the lawsuits. Lead
paint litigation of this nature has been ongoing since the 1980's with
limited success. The ratings do not anticipate significant net cash
outflows in the near-term for NL, although it is difficult to rule this
possibility out.

Valhi Inc. is a holding company with ownership stakes in NL Industries;
a producer of titanium dioxide pigments, CompX; a producer of locks and
ball bearing slides serving the office furniture industry, TIMET; a
producer of titanium metals products, and Waste Control Specialists; a
provider of hazardous waste disposal services.

Security Breach on Nuclear Waste Train
Inmates Jump Wrong Train, Revealing Vulnerability
of CP&L Shipments

DURHAM, NC - A train carrying high-level nuclear waste between plants owned by
CP&L/Progress Energy was recently boarded illegally by one or more inmates in Richmond
County, NC. The incident, which occurred last month, has serious implications for a
long-running battle over shipments of the "spent" nuclear fuel in the Carolinas, as well
as the growing national debate over the safety of sending thousands of similar
transports to a dumpsite in Nevada in future years.

Evidence of the security breach was discovered by David Lochbaum of the Union of
Concerned Scientists, who found an NRC cover letter for a classified report on the
mishap and forwarded it to North Carolina environmental group NC WARN. The Associated
Press was later told by CP&L that two or more "escapees" or "inmates on work release"
had jumped the train by mistake, and shortly afterward left the train after seeing a
number of armed guards on board. The NC Highway patrol later said only one inmate from a
nearby probation camp was involved. The train was en route from CP&L's Robinson plant in
South Carolina, carrying waste to be stored at the Shearon Harris plant in central North
Carolina. CP&L also ships waste to Harris from its two reactors near Wilmington, NC.

A CP&L spokesperson indicated to AP that the event proved its security methods are
sound. However, NC WARN said today that the breach is more evidence that waste trains
are not protected from terrorists. "If these people had been intending to cause serious
harm, they were in perfect position to do so," said Nora Wilson, an organizer with the
group. "Being scared off by armed guards after they were already on the train? That's
too late."

Lochbaum commented, "Terrorists would not have boarded the train unarmed. The defenders
didn't succeed in denying access, which could have led to a real problem if these had
been attackers carrying explosives." An attack situation could also involve people
willing to sacrifice their lives, which would make them even more dangerous.

High-level waste fuel is among the deadliest materials on Earth, and a number of federal
and private studies have shown transport casks to be vulnerable to attack by various
weapons - some from very long distances. An attack could release radioactive particles
into the air, potentially exposing thousands of people in a populated area to levels
causing serious injuries, latent cancers, and possibly immediate deaths. Also, a release
could cause property damage in the tens of millions of dollars over dozens of square
miles. CP&L's shipments sometimes exceed one million curies of radioactivity.

CP&L also told AP that its waste trains were a closely guarded secret, but Wilson
countered that the shipments have been coming to the Harris plant for 13 years - and
arrive each month. CP&L/Progress is the only U.S. utility shipping the waste fuel, and
does so to avoid buying casks for storage at each generating reactor, as is done at
nearly a third of the nation's reactors. For three years, the corporation has been under
intense pressure from citizen groups and local officials to halt the transports, which
they see as an unnecessary risk.

Recently, the Bush Administration and a number of state politicians have joined the
nuclear industry in pressing for approval of the Nevada site. Scientists and
environmental groups argue that politics is trumping scientific problems at Yucca, and
groups such as NC WARN are demanding measures to protect the waste onsite without delay.
Wilson added, "This waste is too dangerous to now be moving through Carolina communities
- and too dangerous to send thousands of nuclear trucks and trains to Nevada in order to
bail out the nuclear industry."

South Carolina Battles U.S. on
Plutonium

By DAVID FIRESTONE

ATLANTA, April 11 -  Unable to reach agreement on the future of plutonium shipments to
South Carolina, the governor and the federal Department of Energy threatened each other
today with a showdown over the processing of nuclear waste that the government says is
vital to national security.

Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy, sent a letter to the governor, Jim Hodges,
offering a written agreement and new legislation ensuring that the plutonium would not
be permanently stored in South Carolina after it was processed at the Savannah River
Site in the southern corner of the state.

If the governor cannot accept those promises, Mr. Abraham wrote, the Energy Department
will revoke them on Monday and begin shipping the waste into South Carolina.

But Governor Hodges said the government had failed to make a legally binding promise not
to store the plutonium in his state, and he demanded that the two sides get a court
order enforcing the promise. Without an agreement that the promise was enforceable in
court, he said at a news conference today, he will physically prevent the Energy
Department's trucks from rolling over the state line.

"We want to make sure South Carolina has the legal tools available to make sure the
government keeps its promises," Mr. Hodges told reporters today. "There will be no
plutonium shipments until they do so."

The 34 metric tons of plutonium under debate was left from the production of nuclear
weapons, and much of it is stored at the defunct Rocky Flats Arsenal in Colorado, which
is scheduled to be dismantled by 2006.

In 1996, in an effort to prevent the plutonium from falling into the wrong hands, the
United States and Russia agreed to take equal amounts of plutonium out of their nuclear
stockpiles, and the government plans to convert the material to fuel for nuclear power
plants at the South Carolina site and then distribute it to nuclear plants around the
country. (The fuel cannot be used for weapons.)

In his letter, Mr. Abraham committed the federal government to processing and removing
the fuel, or removing the plutonium if for any reason it could not be processed. He
offered to submit legislation to Congress that would guarantee such a removal, and said
the government would stop shipping plutonium if the legislation was not passed by Oct.
15.

"I believe we have gone to extraordinary lengths to endeavor to accommodate your
concerns on every point," the secretary said in his letter. Any further delay, he said,
would undermine the disposal agreement with Russia and would jeopardize other cleanup
efforts around the nation, including the timely closure of Rocky Flats.

The governor responded that he would accept Mr. Abraham's terms only if they were
entered into an order in Federal District Court. Otherwise, he said, a new
administration or a new Congress could change its mind down the road and leave South
Carolina holding the nuclear waste that no other state wants. But the Energy Department
said that a matter of national policy could not be left up to the courts.

Clearly political considerations are part of the dispute.

Mr. Hodges is a Democrat and will win points in his state for standing up to Washington,
while Republicans in South Carolina are backing the Bush administration and saying it
has made a good-faith offer.

But underlying the politics is a familiar issue of national policy regarding which state
will have to accept nuclear waste. Colorado wants to see Rocky Flats dismantled, and
Senator Wayne Allard, a Republican from the state, accused Governor Hodges this week of
endangering national security by playing politics with the shipments. Nevada officials
are bitterly fighting the Bush administration's plan to store wastes in Yucca Mountain.

Turning the plutonium into nuclear fuel will solve part of the disposal problem, but Mr.
Hodges made it clear this week that he was not willing to put his trust in the promise
of such technology. Officials predicted today that the situation would be resolved short
of a border confrontation, but both sides remember that Idaho stopped incoming shipments
of waste in 1988 using the state police.

Plutonium suit dismissed
Ruling against Hodges clears way for shipments to S.C.
By SAMMY FRETWELL
Staff Writer

AIKEN - A federal judge says plutonium can be shipped from Colorado to South
Carolina, where some leaders fear it will be left forever.

Judge Cameron McGowan Currie on Thursday dismissed Gov. Jim Hodges' lawsuit
that challenged federal shipments to the Savannah River Site near Aiken.

Trucks could leave for SRS as soon as Saturday, although it was unclear
whether the U.S. Department of Energy would move that quickly.

Hodges said he will appeal the judge's decision to the U.S. Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals to try to keep the plutonium out of South Carolina.

The ruling comes amid increasing fears that nuclear material might fall into
the hands of terrorists, who could use small amounts of the material to create
so-called "dirty bombs."

Concerned that the weapons-grade material will be left in South Carolina
indefinitely, Hodges wants the DOE to study the environmental impact of
storing plutonium in the state more closely.

Currie said the DOE has studied the issue thoroughly within the past six
years.

Hodges, citing the dangers of plutonium, has pledged to have state troopers
stop shipments at the South Carolina border. He's even vowed to lie in the
road to turn back plutonium trucks. His lawyers say just 10 pounds of
plutonium can be fashioned into an atomic bomb.

Hodges would not specifically say Thursday if he still planned to use state
troopers as a roadblock.

But Hodges' attorney Billy Want told Currie the governor "does not plan to
break any state or federal law." Currie, in denying a DOE request to prevent
Hodges from trying to block the plutonium, said she believed he would obey the
law.

Hodges' spokesman, Morton Brilliant, said the governor was considering an
executive order effectively closing the roads to plutonium shipments.

Currie ordered Hodges to notify the court if he planned to try to stop the
shipments.

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham did not say when the shipments would begin,
but U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said he would press for them to start
immediately.

Hodges sued the Energy Department on May 1 to block the plutonium shipments.
He has questioned the federal commitment to remove plutonium. And he argued
the environmental impact of storing the material at SRS has not been properly
studied.

"If we lose, then the nation's weapons grade plutonium comes to South Carolina
for long-term storage, and that's simply unacceptable," Hodges said of his
appeal. "I will continue to use every legal power that I have to make sure
South Carolinians are taken care of and that our health and safety is
protected."

Lawyers familiar with the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said it's unlikely to
overturn Currie's decision. The court, in Richmond, Va., is one of the
country's most conservative appeals courts, Columbia environmental lawyer Bob
Guild said.

Abraham said Thursday's ruling will allow the DOE to continue with its plan to
ship the material from Rocky Flats, Colo., where workers are scrambling to
cleanse the site of nuclear waste and unused plutonium.

"We are very pleased with the court's ruling, which protects our national
security as well as the people of South Carolina," Abraham said in a
statement.

Abraham also said the judge's decision helps preserve a treaty with Russia to
render 34 metric tons of weapons grade plutonium in each country into a form
useless for atomic bombs.

Currie's ruling follows months of wrangling between the DOE and Hodges over
long-term plans for plutonium in South Carolina.

Hodges wants assurances the Energy Department won't leave the material at SRS
forever. He says the government is trying to renege on a commitment to turn
plutonium into mixed oxide fuel for use in nuclear power plants over the next
two decades.

The DOE says it has committed $3.8 billion to the MOX fuel program. The
federal government says Hodges' opposition threatens national security,
international arms treaties, and the cleanup of atomic material at Rocky
Flats.

Currie clearly sided with the DOE on Thursday.

She dismissed Hodges' attempt to temporarily block the shipments until the
environmental impacts of plutonium could be studied. And she surprised nuclear
activists and state attorneys by throwing out the governor's entire case.

In her ruling, Currie said the federal government had adequately examined the
risks of keeping plutonium in an old SRS reactor for up to 50 years. The issue
was examined in a 1996 environmental impact study and two follow-up reports,
she said.

Currie said the plutonium coming from Rocky Flats was less dangerous than
plutonium already at SRS. Plutonium at SRS has not been stabilized or
packaged, as opposed to the material from Rocky Flats, she said.

About 650 of nearly 2,000 cans of plutonium to be shipped from Rocky Flats are
already packaged said Paul Golan, chief operating officer for the DOE's
environmental management program.

In addition, Currie agreed with federal lawyers that postponing the shipments
would delay completion of the Rocky Flats cleanup. An extended delay could
cost taxpayers millions of dollars, the government says.

Thursday's court hearing was closely watched by anti-nuclear activists, about
30 of whom pitched tents, carried signs and handed out brochures supporting
Hodges. They also oppose plans to process all the plutonium into MOX fuel,
rather than turning some of it into glass.

U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the ruling is appropriate. He
challenged Hodges to back away from his opposition and support a bill in
Congress that Graham says ensures the plutonium doesn't stay in South Carolina
forever.

S.C. Gov. Hodges orders state troopers to bar federal plutonium shipments

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -  Gov. Jim Hodges ordered state troopers and other authorities to
South Carolina's borders Friday to stop federal shipments of plutonium that could
begin arriving from Colorado as early as this weekend.

"I order that the transportation of plutonium on South Carolina roads and highways is
prohibited," Hodges said. "I order that any persons transporting plutonium shall not
enter the state of South Carolina."

Hodges, who has vehemently opposed the shipments, read a statement declaring a state
of emergency but refused to answer any questions about specific plans for roadblocks
or other barricades at South Carolina's River Site, a nuclear weapons complex
near Aiken.

On Thursday, a federal judge refused to block the shipments of weapons-grade
plutonium. Hodges appealed the ruling and asked for a delay until the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals could hear the case.

The Energy Department plans to move the material from the Rocky Flats weapons
installation in Colorado, which is being cleaned up and closed, to the Savannah River
Site, where the material would be converted into nuclear reactor fuel over the next
two decades.

But Hodges has said he fears the government will end up leaving the plutonium
permanently in South Carolina, making the state a tempting target for terrorists.

"The Department of Energy has broken promises, offered no assurances and left few
options. Once plutonium arrives, it will never leave," Hodges said. "They want South
Carolina to quietly become the nation's plutonium dumping ground."

The shipments legally could begin as early as this weekend, but U.S. Attorney Strom
Thurmond Jr. said Energy Department officials told him they would not start before
June 22.

A message left for an Energy Department spokesman was not immediately returned Friday
afternoon.

Vice President Dick Cheney, in South Carolina on Friday for a fund-raiser, said the
fuel-conversion program is important to ensure that plutonium "never falls into the

U.S. Will Resume Production of Nuclear Warhead Triggers
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON, June 1 -  The federal government has announced plans to resume
production of plutonium "pits," which are used to trigger nuclear warheads, the
Energy Department has announced.

The department halted production of the softball-size plutonium triggers in
1989.

"We need to have the capacity to manufacture certified pits to maintain the
safety, security and reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent into the
future," Secretary Spencer Abraham of the Energy Department said on Friday.

Design work is beginning for the manufacturing plant, which is expected to cost
$2.2 billion to $4.4 billion, depending on its production capacity, said a
statement from the National Nuclear Security Administration, which is part of
the Energy Department.

The plant, to be built at a weapons facility, would start production by 2020.
The announcement from the Energy Department said the site-selection process
would begin in September.

The department relies on refurbishing triggers, as they are needed, from
disassembled warheads. That limited production, done at the Pantex facility
near Amarillo, Tex., cannot meet long-term needs, officials said.

A recent study by the Bush administration urged construction of a
pit-production plant, and some members of both the House and Senate have
expressed concern that the lack of a such plant could jeopardize future
readiness of the country's nuclear weapons stockpile.

Plutonium triggers were last produced at the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado.
That plant is being cleaned of radioactive waste.

RALEIGH, NC, USA, Jun. 3 -/E-Wire/-- The States of Alabama, Florida,
Tennessee, 
and Virginia and the Southeast Compact Commission for Low-Level
Radioactive 
Waste Management today (June 3) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme
Court to enforce $90 million in sanctions against the State of North Carolina. 
The suit
accuses North Carolina of failing to comply with the provisions of North
Carolina and the Southeast Compact laws and of not meeting its obligations as a
member of the Compact.

"North Carolina did not live up to its promise to Alabama, Florida, Tennessee,
Virginia, and the other two states in the Compact," said James Setser, Chairman
of the Commission.  "The member states and the Compact
Commission have a moral and a legal responsibility to ensure that North
Carolina fulfills its obligations to all of the members of the Southeast
Compact and the citizens of our region."

Today's filing with the U.S. Supreme Court represents the next step to
enforce sanctions imposed against North Carolina by the Compact Commission in
December 1999.

Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor stated, "North Carolina must be held
accountable for its failure to provide a site for disposal of low-level
radioactive waste for the Southeast.  Alabama is committed to live up to its
obligations and we expect nothing less from North Carolina."

In July 2000, the Commission, on behalf of its member states, requested
the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce the sanctions against North Carolina. The
Commission asked the Court to exercise its powers of original jurisdiction,
which would allow the suit to bypass the lower courts and go directly to the
Supreme Court.

In June 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Commission's motion for leave
to file a bill of complaint, saying only that a state and not solely the
Commission acting on behalf of a state or states, could invoke the Court's
original jurisdiction.  The Court did not address the merits of the complaint
against North Carolina.  The Court's ruling left the door open for Alabama,
Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia, as members of the Compact, to file today's
joint complaint with the Compact Commission

"The decision to file a lawsuit against another State is not one to be
made lightly," said Virginia Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore.  "But, the
circumstances here have left us no choice.  The size of the sum involved, the
refusal of North Carolina to make payment and the need for an environmentally
safe, long-term answer to the problem of low-level radioactive waste, make this
dispute appropriate for a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court."

The Southeast Compact for Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management is an
agreement among seven states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia -- to provide for the responsible management
of the region's low-level radioactive
waste (LLRW).  The Compact Commission oversees administration of the Compact.

"There is a growing national crisis in LLRW management.  North Carolina,
Nebraska, and California have all failed to build a waste site," said Mr.
Setser.  "People want the benefits of radioactive materials, such as medical
procedures and smoke detectors, but politicians lack the will to put
the needed facilities in their states."

LLRW is commonly found in industrial and research by-products that have
been exposed to radioactivity.  Sources include such items as discarded
containers, tools, and uniforms used in the operation of nuclear power plants,
the medical industry, hospitals, and universities.  All LLRW can be safely and
responsibly managed and disposed.

Editor's Note: A Chronology of Events with additional information on the
Compact follows.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS IN THE SOUTHEAST LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE COMPACT

1980     Congress enacted the national LLRW Policy Act.

1983     Eight southeast states passed Southeast Compact.

1985     Southeast Compact approved by Congress.

1986     September, Southeast Compact designated North Carolina as second host state.

1987    North Carolina Authority created by North Carolina General Assembly.

1988    February, at the request of North Carolina, the Commission established
the Host State Assistance Fund, which eventually provided a total of $1.2 M to
assist the state.

1988    Compact law amended at the request of North Carolina to implement
limitations on withdrawal from compact and serving as host state.

1989    October, at the request of North Carolina, the Commission adopted a
Capacity Assurance Charge of $20 per cubic foot on regional waste going to the
Barnwell, South Carolina facility to provide funds to the state for licensing
activities.

1990    November, at the request of North Carolina, Southeast Compact adopted
Access Fee to raise an additional $12 M for development of the regional facility.

1991     December, North Carolina facility originally expected to open under
Compact Law.

1992    February, Southeast Compact adopted resolution recommending that the
Barnwell facility remain open with milestones for North Carolina.

1992    June, South Carolina General Assembly voted to allow the Barnwell
facility to remain open until 1/1/96.

1992    August, Southeast Compact adopted Import Policy to allow for out-of-
region waste to continue going to Barnwell from 1/1/93 to 6/30/94.

1992    November, at the request of North Carolina, Southeast Compact
established an Access Fee to raise an additional $36 M for the state's
licensing activities.

1993     December, Wake Co. site selected by Authority and license application
submitted.

1995     July, South Carolina withdrew from Southeast Compact.

1995     November, Southeast Compact delayed additional funding to North
Carolina.

1996    April, Southeast Compact notified Gov. Hunt that North Carolina would
need to provide some part of the funding necessary to carry the facility to
completion.

1996     June, North Carolina developed Licensing Work Plan (LWP) to complete
the project.

1996     June, Southeast Compact stopped funding for project without assurances
from North Carolina that a license decision would be reached.

1996     October, Southeast Compact authorized release of funds to North
Carolina.

1997     January, Authority began work on LWP.

1997    May, Commission's Task Force for Facility Funding issued report on
funding needed to complete the LWP, litigation, and construction of the
facility.

1997    August, Southeast Compact adopted MOU proposed by utility generators
group as a recommended means of resolving funding issues with North Carolina
under which the Compact and regional waste generators would provide necessary
funding in exchange for certain conditions and guarantees by North Carolina.

1997    December, Commission stopped funding when North Carolina did not agree
with MOU or propose a reasonable alternative proposal.

1997    December, the North Carolina Authority voted to begin the shutdown of
the project.

1998    January, North Carolina ceased all licensing activities.

1998    The Commission initiated a formal mediation process with the North
Carolina Authority to resolve the funding issues with the state.  No resolution
was reached.

1999    April, the Southeast Compact Commission notified Governor Hunt and the
leadership of the legislature of the state's obligation under the compact law
to provide a LLRW disposal facility for the region and the Commission's belief
that North Carolina was in violation of the compact law.

1999    June, the commissioners from Florida and Tennessee filed a formal
complaint against North Carolina for alleged failure to fulfill its obligations
under the compact and asked the Commission to impose sanctions against the
state.

1999    July, the North Carolina General Assembly approved and Governor Hunt
signed into law legislation to withdraw from the compact and to shut down the
licensing process in the state.

1999    July, the Sanctions Committee of the Commission recommended that the
Commission should initiate a formal inquiry into the complaint filed against
North Carolina by the commissioners from Florida and Tennessee.

1999    August, the Commission met and voted to initiate a formal inquiry into
the complaint filed against North Carolina by the commissioners from Florida and 
Tennessee.

1999    December, the Commission held a formal hearing of the complaint filed
against North Carolina by the commissioners from Florida and Tennessee.

1999    December, the Commission met and found that North Carolina had violated
and failed to comply with the provisions of the Compact and had violated and
failed to fulfill its obligations as a party state.

1999    December, the Commission resolved to impose $90 million in sanctions
against North Carolina.

2000    July, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court against
the State of North Carolina to enforce sanctions against North Carolina for the
state's failure to comply with the provisions of the Southeast Compact law and
to fulfill its obligations as a party state to the Compact.  The Commission
asked the Court to exercise its powers of original jurisdiction, which would
allow the suit to bypass the lower courts and go directly to the Supreme Court.

2000    September, the Attorney General of North Carolina filed a Brief in
Opposition to the Commission's lawsuit.  The State opposes the action by the
Commission, arguing, among other things, that the nature of the case does not
justify the exercise of original jurisdiction by the Court.

2000    September, the Commission filed its Reply Brief in response to the
North Carolina brief.

2000    October, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order inviting the U.S.
Solicitor General's office to provide a brief expressing the view of the United
States regarding the Commission's suit against North Carolina.  No further
information was provided in the order.

2001    May, the acting U.S. Solicitor General filed an amicus curiae brief
with the U.S. Supreme Court.

2001 June, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order denying the Commission's
motion for leave to file a bill of complaint.  The order did not address the
merits of the Commission's complaint against North Carolina.

Starmet CMI Inc. Barnwell facility (South Carolina)

State orders emergency shutdown of Starmet uranium processing facility

On June 25, 2002, the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental 
Control  closed down the Barnwell County company
Starmet CMI Inc. , evicting most of the 75 employees and installing armed guards.
In an emergency order, the state contends the company has, in the past two years: 

       Repeatedly violated state environmental laws and regulations. 
       Improperly stored almost 8,000 metric tons of low-level radioactive 
       waste on site. Some drums leaked waste; some others were left sitting open, the state found. 
       Contaminated the soil, air and groundwater with radioactive and hazardous waste. 

The state also contends the company didn't provide enough security for the site, 
where a component used in military airplane wings and classified products are made. Until
recent years, Starmet made tank penetrators, said the company's attorney, Bill Short of Columbia.
The state contends in its order that Starmet, which has filed for protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, doesn't have the assets to adequately address
the problems. Its sister company, Starmet NMI Inc. in Concord, Mass., is now a 
Superfund site, meaning the government has placed a priority on cleaning it up. (Charlotte
Observer June 27, 2002)

Federal environmental officials are beginning a $500,000 "temporary cleanup" 
of a Concord Superfund site.   The Environmental Protection Agency will install
 a permanent fence around the "old landfill" portion of the 46-acre Starmet 
 Corp. site, install temporary covers over the old
landfill and a holding basin, and provide security if needed. 
According to the EPA, the holding basin and groundwater at the site have been 
contaminated with depleted uranium, volatile organic compounds and other toxic metals,
including beryllium. (AP Apr. 29, 2002) 

State sues Starmet over DU waste (Massachusetts)

3,800 barrels containing about 1800 metric tonnes of of depleted uranium and its byproducts 
are stuck in Concord, Mass., because the company that produced the waste is
nearly bankrupt. The state attorney general's office filed a lawsuit to force Starmet Corp.
  to dispose of the waste. Starmet used the metal to make tank-piercing weapons until
1999. (Boston Globe Feb. 1, 2002)

On June 14, 2001, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added 10 new hazardous waste 
sites to the National Priorities List (NPL), including the Nuclear Metals, Inc. site
in Concord, Mass.
Nuclear Metals, Inc. produced depleted uranium products, primarily as penetrators for

Nuclear Dump Disrupts a Peaceful Taiwan Island

June 30, 2002
By KEITH BRADSHER 

LAN YU, Taiwan, June 27 - Steep volcanic slopes carpeted
with tropical vegetation vault out of crystalline waters
and magnificent coral reefs here, while a peaceful tribe of
aborigines, largely insulated from the outside world until
the early 1970's, tries to cling to ancient ways. 

This island seems like a tropical paradise except for one
problem: it is also home to one of the world's most
troubled nuclear waste dumps. Up to 20,000 barrels of
radioactive debris need to be fixed because chemical
reactions inside are cracking the concrete with which the
waste was mixed, the site's director says. The barrels are
in seaside concrete trenches on the most windswept tip of
this typhoon- and earthquake-prone island, at the base of a
1,500-foot-high bluff prone to rockslides. 

After President Chen Shui-bian recently said that Taiwan's
government would be unable to keep a promise made 12 years
ago to remove the dump by the end of this year, most of the
island's 3,000 people, who belong to the Tao tribe,
descended from Polynesian explorers, marched to the site.
Some overran the dump and occupied it overnight. 

Local leaders threaten that unless action is taken soon,
they may resort to more drastic action. 

"We will burn or dig out the waste and throw it into the
ocean," said the Rev. Syamen Nga Rai, general secretary of
the 25-member tribal committee that is negotiating with the
government. "It will be in the whole world, because the
ocean moves." 

Chen Chien-nien, the government's minister for indigenous
peoples, who make up 1.7 percent of Taiwan's population,
said the Tao were right to be upset. "If the residents were
Chinese or Taiwanese in the beginning, they probably would
not have built the dump there," he said. 

But Mr. Chen, an aborigine himself from the Puyuma tribe
who is not related to the president, said the Tao should
trust President Chen's recent promises to find a new home
for the dump. "The Tao thought that once you say that, you
have to do it immediately," he said. "Even if you want to
work on it, removing the dump site takes six or seven
years." 

Taipei has set up two task forces in the last month, one to
step up the search for a new home for the waste and the
other to draft an economic development plan for Lan Yu, one
of the poorest places in Taiwan. 

The government's favorite choice, burying the waste under
the seabed next to Wu Chiu Islet in the Taiwan Strait,
still requires environmental studies. The plan is also
likely to face objections from China, since the islet is
just 16 miles from its coast. 

The dump here has only a 10-person technical staff, none of
them aborigines, and a dozen local security guards and
janitors. There is a six-foot-high stone wall around the
dump. 

Wu Ruey-yau, the planning director at the government's
Atomic Energy Council, said it would be difficult for
anyone to break in and remove any radioactive waste. Each
panel of the trenches' lids weighs 12 tons, and the only
cranes on the island are at the site. 

Under Japanese colonial rule through the end of World War
II, this island was closed to outsiders and treated as a
"living laboratory" for Japanese anthropologists to observe
the Tao people. Tribal members wore loincloths made from
the fiber of trees and led an unusually peaceful life in
which land was communally held, warfare and weaponry were
unknown and all decisions were made by panels of village
elders. Flying fish were venerated as gifts of food from
the spiritual world. 

After World War II and the Chinese civil war, the island
became a military outpost for Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists, who had fled the mainland after their defeat
by the Communists. Presbyterian missionaries visited and
converted much of the population. 

Taipei opened the island to visitors in 1969 and, in the
name of progress, bulldozed most of the traditional,
stone-walled homes over the objections of residents. The
government built them three-story, concrete-block apartment
buildings and banned the use of the Tao language. 

Most of the Tao have lived in the apartments ever since,
although some older residents still live in surviving
stone-walled dwellings, fish from handmade canoes and wear
loincloths. Their language is no longer banned, but nearly
all school instruction is in Chinese. 

Oil price shocks in the 1970's prompted the government to
build three nuclear power plants on the main island of
Taiwan. 

Mr. Wu, of the Atomic Energy Council, said Lan Yu residents
were not told that the construction project at the
southeastern tip of their island, where two powerful sea
currents meet and create the island's richest fishing
ground, was actually a nuclear waste dump. 

Construction of the dump was finished in 1982. Workers at
nuclear reactors on the main island of Taiwan began mixing
radioactive waste with concrete, sealing it in 55-gallon
steel drums and shipping it here for storage in the 23
reinforced-concrete trenches. But until 1993, the drums
were made of inexpensive steel that was not treated to
prevent corrosion, and many of these barrels are now
rusting, Mr. Wu said. 

Incomplete records were kept of what was in the early
drums. Only low-level waste is supposed to be inside, but
it is not clear what kind. Workers will begin removing
drums from the trenches later this year and drill holes in
them in an effort to determine the contents. 

Low-quality cement was mixed with the radioactive waste in
many of the early barrels, and is now expanding and
cracking the steel barrels, said Paul T.H. Huang, the
director of the site. As a result, the government is
preparing to grind up to a fifth of the 98,000 barrels here
and remix them with fresh cement. 

Up to 10,000 or so barrels have good cement but the barrels
are corroded, Mr. Huang said. The government plans to pack
these barrels in larger containers and pour fresh cement
around them. As many as 30,000 drums need repainting to
protect them from corrosion, while the remaining drums,
nearly 40,000, are fine, Mr. Huang said. 

All this work is scheduled to begin here as soon as next
year and must be finished before the waste can be moved to
another storage facility. 

Michael Lin, the nuclear waste director at Taiwan Power,
the state-owned electric utility that has operated the site
since 1990, said no radiation had leaked from the site. One
of the semiunderground trenches developed a crack a decade
ago, allowing water to seep in, but the crack was soon
fixed, he said. 

Residents here are distrustful, saying there has been a
spate of cancer cases lately and some fish have been
deformed or have washed up dead on the beach. "There's no
way we can prove a link, but we are scared," said Syanan
Gu Malin, a housewife with two young girls. 

Facing thousands of miles of open ocean, Lan Yu is battered
several times a year by some of the most powerful storms on
earth. A typhoon in 1984 had gusts of up to 201 miles an
hour, according to data from a somewhat sheltered weather
station in the middle of the island. 

The typhoons also dump up to a foot of rain a day, sending
torrents down the bluff toward the site. The government has
tried to divert the rain away from the dump with a
25-foot-wide drainage ditch, but this is filling with silt.

Three months before construction began here in 1978, the
island was hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8.
Boulders tumbled down the bluff onto the site. Several
dozen protective concrete pillars now stand at the base of
the bluff to stop falling rocks. 

Until 1996, water contaminated by radioactive waste was
distilled to remove as much of the contamination as
possible and then dumped into the ocean in front of the
site. Now the water is also stored. 

Large trawlers from the main island of Taiwan have recently
swept the sea here practically clean of fish, forcing the
aborigines to look hard for food. At low tide on a recent
afternoon, several aboriginal women walked across the
jagged volcanic rocks below the nuclear waste dump's sea
wall, occasionally stopping and using long metal spikes to
pry crabs from their holes. "I've been catching crabs here
since I was a kid," said one of the women, who said she was
in her early 50's. "Before there were plenty of crabs and
fish; now there are not so many."

Senate Gives Final Approval to Nevada Nuclear Waste Site

July 9, 2002
By ALISON MITCHELL





WASHINGTON, July 9 - The Senate gave final Congressional
approval today to a nuclear waste repository deep inside
Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert, marking a pivotal
moment in the 20-year search for a home for the radioactive
byproducts of the nation's nuclear reactors.
The action, coming after years of fierce lobbying and a
recent blitz by environmentalists and business groups
alike, was a victory for President Bush. It overrode a veto
of the site by Nevada's Republican governor, Kenny Guinn,
and cleared the way for the Energy Department to apply to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license the waste
repository, to be located 1,000 feet below Yucca Mountain
90 miles from Las Vegas.
The opponents of the site, led by Nevada's two senators,
knew they had lost when the Senate voted 60 to 39 to
consider a resolution to override Nevada's veto. All sides
had said that vote would be the critical test of support.
After that, the Senate approved the resolution by a voice
vote, instead of a formal roll-call vote. Opponents
conceded that they might have lost a roll-call vote by an
even larger margin.
The House of Representatives passed a comparable resolution
by a 306-to-117 vote in May.
Under the Energy Department plan, endorsed by President
Bush earlier this year, the site is to receive high-level
radioactive waste shipments of up to 77,000 tons from 103
nuclear reactors around the country over the next quarter
century.
The site is envisioned to open in 2010 - though it still
faces numerous regulatory and legal hurdles. The nuclear
waste, which stays radioactive for thousands of years, is
currently stored at local plant sites, making many
lawmakers from many states eager for a permanent storage
site somewhere far from their own borders.
Many critics of the plan objected, however, to transporting
all that waste to the Yucca site from plants across the
country.
"Concerns are going to mount, and we are going to rue the
day we allowed the waste through that many streets and
neighborhoods," said Tom Daschle, the Senate majority
leader.
Senator Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, had fiercely
opposed the site, as had his assistant majority leader,
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and the two made one last
plea to fellow Democrats at a closed-door party lunch. But
they were unable to keep their party completely in line, as
15 Democrats joined most of the Republicans to vote to
consider the Yucca Mountain resolution.
Senator John Ensign of Nevada was joined by only two other
Republicans - Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado - in voting to block the
resolution. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North
Carolina, did not vote.
Both sides vyed for votes until the final minutes, with
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham appearing at a closed-door
Republican caucus. In defeat, the Democrats tried to use
the vote to further Democratic campaign charges that
Republicans are beholden to big business. "A lot of special
interests are behind this," said Senator Barbara Boxer, a
California Democrat, who protested that the Yucca Mountain
site risked contaminating California's drinking water. "Who
are we fighting for here? Who are we fighting for here?"
Supporters of the nuclear waste repository called it
critical for the future of the nation's nuclear power
industry, saying the plants were not viable without a
disposal site. Indeed two states, California and
Connecticut, have prohibited new reactors pending some
solution to the waste problem.
"Nuclear power is a clean, efficient source," said Trent
Lott, the Senate minority leader. "We need to deal with
nuclear waste."
Senator Lott, a Mississippi Republican, dismissed opponents
of the nuclear power as unrealistic. "There are people in
America that don't want nuclear power," he said. "They
don't want hydropower, they don't want oil."
Opponents of the Yucca Mountain site raised an array of
safety questions, from whether the repository's design
would prevent groundwater contamination to whether it would
be safe to transport 77,000 tons of highly radioactive
waste across the country, particularly at a time of
terrorist threats.
Mr. Abraham, the energy secretary, today dismissed such
concerns. "We've been transporting the same kind of waste
for 30 years and there hasn't been one harmful exposure,"
he told reporters. "We will take every precaution to
maximize safety. If we didn't go forward with Yucca, there
would be alternative schemes."

Many a Molehill Before Nuke Waste Finds Mountain

July 10, 2002
By MATTHEW L. WALD





WASHINGTON, July 9 -- The political support for burying
nuclear waste beneath Yucca Mountain in Nevada may be as
strong now as in 1987, when Congress first picked the site.
But the Senate's approval of the site today, while it lets
the Energy Department proceed, is far from the last word.
What comes next is more complicated than winning the
blessing of Congress: transforming political momentum into
sound science and engineering, and actually creating a
functioning repository. That is likely to take years - if
indeed it ever comes to pass.
The Energy Department, Yucca Mountain's prime sponsor, is
an old hand at managing giant, first-of-a-kind projects,
but many of them have horrible histories. The
Superconducting Supercollider, an $11 billion project, was
canceled in 1993 after $2 billion had been spent, falling
victim to rising costs and daunting technical problems. The
Clinch River Breeder Reactor, begun in 1970 as a $700
million project, was canceled in 1974 after $1.5 billion
had been spent, as opponents questioned whether it was
worth the effort. For similar reasons, the modernization of
a nuclear fuel plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, begun in 1977,
was canceled in 1985 after $3.5 billion had been spent.
Then there was the nuclear-powered airplane, begun in 1954
and canceled in 1961 after $1 billion had been spent. By
then, there were overwhelming doubts that it would fly.
Yucca Mountain will be even tougher to pull off, in one
regard. Congress has required that the Energy Department, a
mostly self-regulating bureaucracy, win a license from a
sister agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That is
far from easy, even for nuclear power companies with long
experience getting approval from the commission for simpler
projects. In the 1980's, for example, two commercial
reactor projects in the Midwest, Zimmer and Marble Hill,
were canceled because of licensing difficulties.
"Yucca's not a sure thing," said C. William Reamer, the
deputy director of the commission's waste management
division. The Energy Department will have to lay out "not
just their argument, but what supports their argument"
about why the repository will contain the wastes
successfully for 10,000 years, he said.
Thus far, the department does not even have a design. It
plans to put waste in an area unusually subject to rust but
has little data on how its metal canisters will perform. It
has a huge environmental impact statement, but critics say
that in its current form, the statement makes many
unverifiable claims.
Because Yucca Mountain is complex, Congress created a
committee of outside experts, the Nuclear Waste Technical
Review Board, to help assess the Energy Department's work.
Its chairman, Jared L. Cohon, who is the president of
Carnegie Mellon University, said today that for all the
work the department had done so far, there was still "a
relatively high level of uncertainty" about how well it
would isolate the waste. Congress may have voted, Dr. Cohon
said, but "that issue is still there."
Too, the Energy Department needs to keep working to
understand how water, which will spread the waste, moves
through the mountain; then it needs to explain this to the
public, Dr. Cohon said.
But right now, the department will probably turn its
attention to preparing a license application. Under the
law, the department is supposed to apply for a license
within 60 days of Congressional approval. But it has told
the commission that it will file more than two years late,
by December 2004. In most Energy Department projects,
including this one so far, nothing happens ahead of
schedule and most things happen later.
The nuclear commission is supposed to decide in three years
whether to grant a license, but it may take a fourth. If
the staff asks the department too many questions, the
review could easily take longer, experts say. The
commission expects an adversarial hearing with 8 to 10
parties, each of which can raise questions and make
arguments. In the 1960's and 70's, when the commission was
still licensing power reactors, a hearing with only three
or four parties could drag on for years.
There is more potential for delay in the commission's
insistence on a detailed safety analysis before it grants a
license. The Energy Department's practice is to build major
factories while simultaneously working on critical
technical details, a technique pioneered in World War II to
build the atom bomb, and still in use. For example, in the
1980's the department started work on a processing plant in
Aiken, S.C., for solidifying liquid wastes, without
figuring out how it would get wastes out of storage tanks
and into the plant without producing flammable gases. Now
the solidification plant is running but is limited in how
much waste it can process because the flammable gas problem
has not been solved.
The Yucca Mountain project has something going for it that
previous doomed projects lacked. The federal government
needs it to resolve its commercial dispute with the nuclear
utilities. Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the
utilities all signed contracts with the government,
agreeing to pay one-tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour
generated at their reactors, in exchange for the
government's taking their wastes, beginning in 1998.
But Yucca Mountain also has first-of-a-kind disadvantages.
For one, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is supposed to
decide on granting a license by applying rules written by
the Environmental Protection Agency. But those rules are
being challenged by Nevada and by the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, which argue that
the agency gerrymandered the site's boundaries to allow for
excessive leakage. The boundaries look like a gigantic
number 9, with a three-mile ring around the repository and
a tail of about 10 miles in the direction that water flows
underground. Geoffrey H. Pettus, a lawyer with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, called it "an underground septic
field."
Nevada has other legal challenges under way, too.
Then
there is the fact that Yucca Mountain is too small. The
resolution passed today limits it to 77,000 tons, but the
nation will produce more than 100,000. Congress may have to
act again.

Industry Tackles Packaging of Nuclear Waste for Yucca
July 16, 2002
By MATTHEW L. WALD 

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. - While lawyers, senators and even an
occasional geologist argue over whether Yucca Mountain in
Nevada is a suitable place to store nuclear waste,
scientific entrepreneurs around the country are focusing on
a finer detail: how the waste can be packaged to isolate it
for 10,000 years. 

The Senate's approval of Yucca on July 9 makes the question
urgent. 

So far, the Energy Department, which is in charge of Yucca,
has chosen conventional materials; its current plan is for
a cask made of steel alloyed with chrome, molybdenum and
nickel, called alloy 22, and a titanium tent above that.
The department says it needs 10,000 packages, and plans to
spend about $500,000 per package, so the financial
incentives are significant. 

But some scientists doubt that anything metal can sit for
thousands of years without rusting in rock that has
rainwater percolating through it. A few are offering
alternatives, including recently developed ceramics and
polymers. 

In a laboratory here at Rutgers University, a start-up
company, Nucon, is showing off a scale model made of an odd
new ceramic. Ceramics are not known for strength, but this
has the same compression strength as steel, Nucon says.
Ceramics can be used as thermal insulators, but this one is
cold to the touch, a sign that it conducts heat readily.
This is desirable in a material that must isolate
heat-generating waste that cannot be allowed to heat itself
to the melting point. 

This ceramic has these unusual traits because it has
exceptional density and has been painstakingly baked in a
process called cintering. 

Cintering gives it another odd quality. Tapped with a metal
pen, the model rings like a bell. The sound brings a smile
to the face of the company's chief engineer, Adam Khizh,
who came to this country from Russia nine years ago.
"Perfect cintering," Dr. Khizh said. "The sound is very
clear." 

Nucon's material is a spinel, or magnesium-aluminum oxide.
Oxidation (or, in plain English, rust) is the big worry at
Yucca. But oxides do not rust; they have already oxidized. 

So far, no one has cast ceramic containers large enough to
hold bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods. Nucon believes it
can do this, although the model it displays is about the
size of half a large watermelon. 

Dr. Jared L. Cohon, chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical
Review Board, a panel established by Congress, said that
early plans for Yucca had included a ceramic covering over
the metal, and that this was dropped because engineers
doubted that the covering could withstand rough handling.
But a ceramic that could would be appealing, he said,
because it would resist corrosion far better than metal. 

Some ceramics experts are dubious. Dr. Delbert E. Day, a
professor of ceramic engineering at the University of
Missouri at Rolla, and a former president of the American
Ceramic Society, said it might be simpler to protect the
steel by encasing it in concrete. 

Paige R. Russell, the Yucca project's technical lead for
waste package design and testing, said that no final
packaging decisions had been made and that the design of
the containers so far was "conceptual." But for now, she
said, the Energy Department has come down in favor of a
material it knows better: metal. She said the project would
probably choose proven rather than experimental materials. 

"We have to understand the performance of the material
over time," she said. "We have to understand the
performance of the material in different environments, how
to manufacture and fabricate the material. There are a lot
of positives to using materials that are already known and
have been used in industry." 

Ceramics are used to stabilize high-level nuclear waste,
but only as a matrix material, not as a wrapper. 

For low-level wastes - as opposed to the high-level spent
fuel that the department wants to bury at Yucca - the
Energy Department is trying a new material, a polymer foam
that its manufacturer believes will bind up radioactive
materials indefinitely. But the big challenge is spent
reactor fuel, which will remain intensely radioactive for
centuries and has many components that policy makers want
to keep out of underground water for millenniums. 

The Energy Department's early plan was for ordinary steel,
but it moved up to alloy 22 for better corrosion
resistance. But alloy 22 is harder to weld than ordinary
carbon steel, and welds, experts say, are where failure
most often occurs. 

The department's plan is for a "drip shield" of titanium
over each container. The containers would be 6 to 7 feet in
diameter, and about 16 feet long, to be parked in a line,
filling the tunnel like subway cars. 

Nucon sees instead giant, 50-ton elongated watermelons made
of ceramic, 18 feet long, with a wall 3 inches thick and an
inner diameter of 5 1/2 feet. The ovoid shape is a way to
reduce the risk of cracking the ceramic if it bangs into
something; with rounded ends, the force of impact would be
better distributed around the container. 

Nucon believes it has made an important advance in being
able to cast thick ceramics. Making a thick ceramic is a
challenge because cintering requires even heating and
cooling, increasingly difficult in thick structures.
Nucon's solution is a combination of conventional thermal
heating, plus microwave energy, which heats evenly. It
recently won a patent on a microwave device for a second
purpose: marrying together the two halves of the
watermelon. 

"Most of the leakage in metal containers begins at the
point of sealing," Matthew O'Connor, the company president,
said. But using microwave energy to fuse the pieces
together would leave no seam, he said. The ceramic includes
a "susceptor" that captures the microwave energy and
converts it to heat. A proprietary technology allows
application of the microwave energy without heating the
wastes inside. 

Another important characteristic is density, which is about
3.5 grams per cubic centimeter, about half that of steel
but far heavier than most ceramics. With high density, or
few voids, strength is improved, and so is thermal
conductivity, which is essential to prevent the wastes from
stewing themselves to the melting point. 

Nucon raised density by using an optimized mix of grain
sizes, from 6 or 7 microns (millionths of a meter) in
diameter down to 30 nanometers (billionths of a meter). 

The spinel begins as a material that looks like talcum
powder and is broken down further. The micron-range
particles are made by tossing the material in a ball mill,
with balls the size of marshmallows; the smaller particles
are broken up by balls the size of BB's. 

The nanometer-size particles are highly reactive, meaning
that they glue together well. Using a radiation laboratory
at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Nucon exposed a sample
to one billion rads of gamma rays, 10 times as great as the
exposure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires of a
cask. 

The company has yet to demonstrate its technology at full
size and has not attracted much interest from the Energy
Department, but others find the idea of a ceramic
appealing. 

Dr. Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy
and Environmental Research and an outside critic of the
department who has studied its waste problems for 20 years,
said, "Metal is a bad thing to put into Yucca Mountain if
you want to say anything with confidence." Using a ceramic
could increase confidence in the containers' durability, he
said. 

The department has taken a brief look at another
technology, a foam called Ekor, which was sprayed over
reactor rubble at Chernobyl. It was used on one mound about
six feet long, three feet high and three feet wide that was
giving off 1,000 rads per hour - in other words, a fatal
dose in about half an hour - and appears unchanged after
two years, said Paul C. Childress, vice president and
general manager of the nuclear and environmental division
of the company that makes the product, Eurotech. The Energy
Department is not persuaded, so far, that it will last for
the hundreds or thousands of years that will be required. 

Mr. Childress, who formerly worked for the Energy
Department, said: "Rainwater would just simply roll off. It
completely repels water, whether it's acidic or alkaline.
It's almost impervious to chemical attack." 

But it is intended to encapsulate small chunks of waste,
not hold large intact structures. It could be an
alternative for another form of waste now planned for
Yucca, sludges in tanks at the Hanford and Savannah River
nuclear reservations. Those materials, under current plans,
will be mixed into glass to stabilize them. 

Ekor may also be used to coat the drip shields, he said.
That will allow the shields to be made of something less
costly than titanium, perhaps aluminum, Mr. Childress said.

Ms. Russell said, however, that the department was wary of
polymers, because they contain materials that feed
microbes, which can induce corrosion. So thus far at least,
Yucca is planning an all-metal solution.

 As Senator, Abraham Raised Nuclear Waste Shipment Worries His Energy
 Department Now Dismisses

 WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Spencer Abraham has
 consistently dismissed concerns about transportation risks that have arisen
 over the Department's plan to send up to 100,000 shipments of high-level
 nuclear waste through the states of dozens of U.S. Senators on its way to
 Yucca Mountain, Nevada. But just four years ago, Secretary Abraham expressed
 strong concerns to DOE as U.S. Senator from Michigan about a proposed shipment
 of just several ounces of plutonium (five kilograms of nuclear material in
 total) through his state. In an August 27, 1998 letter, Abraham sharply
 criticized DOE for failing to properly inform the public of shipment routes
 and for proposing to truck radioactive material over a new bridge subject to
 heavy traffic. He also worried that DOE had not prepared local communities for
 an emergency. "Given the local population concentrations and geography,"
 Abraham wrote then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, "I am sure you will agree
 that the ramifications of an accident are too serious to consider anything
 less than the very best emergency response preparedness." The Secretary and
 his spokespeople have often dismissed concerns about the scant information
 given to the public along the routes for the 77,000 tons of nuclear waste as
 scare tactics, saying the chances of an accident are "about nil." (Evansville
 Courier & Press, 6/12/02

 http://www.myinky.com/ecp/ local_news/article/0,1626, ECP_745_1203266,00.html)
 In the August 27, 1998 letter to DOE:

1.Senator Abraham reproached the Department for not telling the community along
the route about the shipments. And, though no public hearings have been
conducted for residents along the nuclear transportation routes in the months
since his Department's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was finalized,
Senator Abraham told DOE in 1998 that it was "imperative that a public hearing
be conducted in the Port Huron/Sarnia area, prior to the environmental
assessment." "To not do so," the Senator wrote, "would be irresponsible and
offensive to Michigan residents." In fact, the Environmental Working Group
(EWG) has had to produce a separate web site to make DOE proposed routes
publicly accessible by conducting billions of computer-assisted calculations
using millions of government records and DOE's routes, which were well hidden
in back of the Secretary's 5,000-page EIS. Secretary Abraham's spokesman on the
nuclear shipments, Joe Davis, also now insists that, "the actual routes will be
classified." (Associated Press, 6/11/02) 2.Senator Abraham also argued that he
was "concerned the shipments may be subject to extended exposure in the
community," though today he and his Department argue repeatedly that the
shipments are completely safe because they have been going on for decades.
"Abraham called the concerns about waste transport 'baseless allegations' and
said that over the past 30 years nuclear waste has been carried more than 1.6
million miles without a harmful release of radiation."(Tampa Bay
Tribune/Associated Press, 5/3/02,

http://ap.tbo.com/ap/ breaking/MGAVT6DQZ0D.html) "The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, working with the Departments of Transportation and Energy, has
overseen approximately 30 years of safe shipment of spent nuclear fuel in this
country. The Department and commercial nuclear industry have substantial
experience to date - some 1.6 million miles - without any harmful radiation
release. And the successful and extensive European experience in transporting
this type of nuclear material corroborates our experience," Abraham said.
(Environment News Service, 4/02,

http://ens.lycos.com/ens/ apr2002/2002L-04-25-04.html) "[DOE Spokesman Joe]
Davis said the DOE has safely transported nuclear waste over the rails and
highways for 40 years. 'During that time, I believe there have been only eight
traffic accidents involving the shipment of nuclear waste, and none of them
resulted in any exposure that was harmful to any individual or the
environment,' he said." (Reno Gazette-Journal, 1/12/02,

http://www.rgj.com/news/ stories/html/2002/01/12/5805 .php) 3."It is essential
that disaster response units within the local community be prepared to respond
to an emergency situation, however unlikely. Federal assistance will be
required to ensure that local emergency response teams are fully prepared to
deal safely and effectively with accidents involving these plutonium
shipments," Senator Abraham argued. Abraham spokesman Joe Davis now dismisses
just such concerns raised by former National Safety Transportation Board
Chairman Jim Hall about Secretary Abraham's nuclear transportation plan.
Senator Abraham closed his letter by asserting that "your immediate review of
this matter prior to the final draft environmental assessment [emphasis added]
will be most appreciated."

"Senator Abraham seems to have been much more sensitive to the concerns of
people living along transportation routes than Secretary Abraham has turned out
to be," said EWG President Ken Cook. "It was ironic when he was selected to
head a Department he once introduced legislation to abolish. It is hypocritical
now to dismiss the very types of concerns he once raised about waste
shipmentshigh traffic routes, poorly informed citizens and local officials,
and lack of preparation for accidents."

COMMITTEE PASSES DOMENICI BILL WITH FUNDING

FOR WIPP & SOUTHEAST N.M. WATER PROJECTS

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy 
and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, today gained full 
committee approval for increased federal support for the Waste Isolation 
Pilot Plant (WIPP) in southeast New Mexico, as well as support for 
federal water projects in the region.

Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that today 
approved the FY2004 Energy & Water Appropriations Bill, a $27.3 billion 
measure to fund the Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear 
Security Administration (NNSA), Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of 
Engineers.

For southeast New Mexico, this bill provides vital funding to support 
WIPP and the DOE Carlsbad Area Office. In addition, Bureau and Army 
Corps funding levels are important for their impact on federal water 
management projects, such as dams on the Pecos River and related 
tributaries.

The bill provides $230.5 million for WIPP and the Carlsbad Area Office 
in FY2004. This amount includes $22.5 million in transportation funding 
to be provided directly to the state of New Mexico.

"I do not foresee problems in getting these WIPP funds approved by the 
Senate," Domenici said. "I think the bill provides a good funding level 
to operate WIPP, and to continue efforts to find economic development 
benefits from the project to promote job creation in the region."

The bill also includes $3.5 million in community impact funding for the 
city of Carlsbad to use for education, infrastructure, and development 
activities. Domenici secured $3.5 million for that work last year.

In addition, the bill continues support for the U.S.-Mexico 
Border/Materials Corridor Initiative, providing $5 million for this 
program, a $2.5 million increase over FY2003. Domenici also secured $2 
million for the Carlsbad Records Center.

Finally, the bill provides $23 million to go toward development of a 
modern pit facility. The Carlsbad area is one site being considered for 
this facility.

Other water project funding approved for eastern and southeast New 
Mexico includes:

BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

Resource Management and Development

-- Carlsbad Project (Eddy County) $ 3.02 million

-- Pecos River Basin Salvage (salt cedar) $327,000

-- Eastern New Mexico Water Supply (Quay, Roosevelt & Curry counties) $ 
250,000

-- Tucumcari Project/Conchas Dam (San Miguel & Quay counties) $ 108,000

ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

Construction

-- Alamogordo Flood Control (Otero County) $ 4.1million

Operations and Maintenance

-- Conchas Lake (San Miguel County) $ 2.462 million

-- Santa Rosa Dam and Lake (Guadalupe County) $ 1.64 million

-- Two Rivers Dam (Guadalupe County) $ 463,000

Subject: the ecologist: radwaste

UK: Where to dump Nuclear Waste?

Campaign.

This autumn, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affiars (DEFRA) published a
consultation paper inviting discussion into how radioactive waste should be disposed of
in the mid-21st century. The mid-21st century? What about today? And how are we going to
deal with the predicted 500 per cent increase in nuclear waste in 10 years' time even if
no new nuclear power stations are built?

Crich is a small village on the edge of the Peak District in Derbyshire and home to
Hilts Quarry, a landfill site owned by Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Ltd (RRMPOL).
Since the mid 1960s, RRMPOL has been burying enriched uranium, cobalt-60 and carbon-14
in Hilts Quarry. Most of the waste, a by-product of building the Royal Navy's nuclear
submarine fleet's reactor cores, was 'free tipped' into holes dug 2 metres deep in
foundry sand. But the quarry is like a sieve - it is unlined and it is formed from
fissured limestone. Furthermore it is situated on top of a hill, just 50m from a primary
school.

A year ago, RRMPOL submitted applications to the Environment Agency for re-authorisation
of the licences for their two Licensed Nuclear Sites at Raynesway, Derby. A section of
these applications deals with the disposal of radioactive waste. In response, a public
meeting was called, at which concerned local residents and politicians formed the Crich
& District Environmental Action Group.

Although RRMPOL's own test results appeared to show that cobalt-60 was escaping into the
local streams, it did not tell the Environment Agency, as it had conveniently decided
that the results were erroneous. Other tests have also shown sharply increasing levels
of enriched uranium and thorium in the river silt. Neither Rolls-Royce nor the
Environment Agency were able to give any assurance that the testing regime was robust,
and the Action Group felt that the available evidence demonstrated that RRMPOL did as
little as they could get away with. The Action Group, which represents the whole
community, has blockaded the entrance to the quarry since 10 July, preventing RRMPOL
delivering waste on all but two occasions. Despite arrests, they have held a protest
march and are continuing to lobby local, national and European politicians and the
Environment Agency to take this problem seriously.

No community should have to live with the fear that radioactive waste brings. The
government must face up to the growing problem of nuclear waste; it must be persuaded to
re-think the case for and against the sort of activities that produce and accumulate
nuclear waste; and it must introduce a disposal strategy for current waste that is safe
now and in the future.

Write to your MP (find him/her at www.locata.co.uk/commons/); say that you don't want
your community to suffer in similar ways; ask them to talk to Crich Village's local MP,
Judy Mallaber, about the issue. Write to Michael Meacher; express your concern about the
projected 500 per cent increase in waste. Ask him how he can guarantee your safety.
Write to: DEFRA, Eland House, Bressenden Place, London SW1E 5DU. For more to support

Irradiating Mail to Congress May Be Making Workers Ill
July 2, 2002
By CARL HULSE 

WASHINGTON, July 1 - The process used to sterilize
Congressional mail after the anthrax attacks last fall
could itself be making Capitol Hill workers sick, a report
to be issued on Tuesday says. 

The Office of Compliance, which is responsible for
Congressional workplace safety, said its inquiry into more
than 200 complaints "concluded that handling irradiated
mail for substantial periods" might cause or contribute to
health problems reported by Congressional employees. 

The findings are the first to suggest that irradiation
could be harmful. The report called for monitoring workers,
further studies on long-term exposure to irradiated mail
and some protective steps, including airing the mail before
delivering it. 

An earlier review for Congressional administrative
officials found no evidence that handling irradiated mail
affected health. The Postal Service has also said that
testing showed the mail is not harmful. 

Kristin Krathwohl, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service,
said the agency would "certainly read the report of the
general counsel of the Office of Compliance with great
care." The Postal Service, Ms. Krathwohl added, was guided
by assurances from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Institutes of Occupational
Safety and Health that irradiation was safe. "We rely on
them," she said. 

Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who sought
the investigation in February, said the report suggested
that the earlier Congressional inquiry "may have been too
quick to conclude irradiated mail was harmless, and they
may not have taken employees' health concerns seriously
enough." 

"Irradiating the mail," Mr. Grassley added, "was and is a
big experiment." 

Hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail to Congress and
federal agencies in Washington are sent each day to a
radiation center in New Jersey for treatment before being
distributed. Wider use of irradiation has been considered.
The process, more often used on food and medical equipment,
exposes mail to an electron beam that renders any anthrax
harmless. 

The irradiation of Washington mail began last November
after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to
Capitol Hill, causing the Hart Senate Office Building to be
closed for months. Anthrax-laced mail in Washington and
elsewhere killed five people. The Postal Service resumed
delivering mail to Congressional offices in January. 

Dozens of House and Senate employees soon complained of
ailments that included headaches, nausea, bloody noses,
rashes and other irritations. Postal workers also reported
problems. The compliance office said that in May it
resurveyed Congressional employees who had filed health
complaints and found that 55 percent of those contacted
continued to report problems, though they were often
milder. 

"The continued symptoms in employees is the single most
important reason in suggesting the need for more study,"
said Gary Green, general counsel of the office. 

The report, Mr. Green said, was compiled with the help of
two specialists in occupational medicine and two industrial
hygienists. Independent environmental testing by the
investigators was also critical to the findings, he said. 

The report said tests of the air from irradiated mailbags
and the House and Senate mail rooms detected small amounts
of chemical irritants that could have been produced from
the paper during irradiation. 

"While we do not believe these chemical irritants are
life-threatening," the report said, "we believe further
study is essential to determine the effects of extended
exposure to irradiated mail, particularly in restricted
work areas." 

Earlier this year, the Postal Service said the irradiation
could produce carbon monoxide, and it began holding the
mail in a ventilating area for 24 hours to let any gas
dissipate. But officials said tests showed no threat to
health. 

The study for a Congressional task force by the National
Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health attributed the
staff complaints to "multiple factors" including odors that
could trigger reactions and "heightened awareness and
resultant employee stress from recent terrorist attacks."

SRS nuclear waste burial proposal comes under fire
By Tim Smith
STAFF WRITER
tsmith@greenvillenews.com

COLUMBIA - The U.S. Energy Department's inspector general has recommended that
the agency bury millions of gallons of radioactive waste in underground vaults
at the Savannah River Site instead of processing it into glass logs and sending
it to a Nevada mountain for storage.

Inspector General Gregory Friedman said burying the waste instead of processing
it will save about $500 million. He also reported that officials within the
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control told him they
would consider approving his recommendation.

But Gov. Jim Hodges, who has battled the Energy Department's plans to store 34
tons of weapons grade plutonium at the Aiken facility, is opposed to burying
the waste there, his spokesman said.

"The governor has said all along that South Carolina should not become the
nation's nuclear dumping ground," said Morton Brilliant, Hodges' spokesman.
"Gov. Hodges has worked very hard, and with some success, to take nuclear waste
out of South Carolina. And it would be a terrible thing for the entire state if
we slide back down that hill."

Ed Lyman, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based,
non-profit group that studies the spread of nuclear weapons, called the
recommendation "outrageous."

"There is no basis at all to conclude that it is safe to dispose of this in
concrete, which is a water-laden solid," Lyman said. "To simply dump it at the
Savannah River Site instead of processing it and disposing of it responsibly is
an outrage."

The Savannah River Site generated the waste during decades of producing
plutonium for nuclear weapons. Since the site shut down production in 1988,
workers have largely focused on cleaning up the radioactive legacy, including
35 million gallons of liquefied waste stored in 49 underground tanks.

Agency officials announced last fall they planned to dispose of salt-bearing
waste from the tanks using a solvent extraction method, which would remove the
most dangerous material, mix it with sludge already being processed and convert
it into glass logs. The logs would then be sent to Yucca Mountain, the nation's
planned permanent repository for radioactive waste.

But Friedman, in a report to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, said disposing
of the waste by mixing it with cement and burying it in underground vaults at
the site would save time and money.

"Although all four treatment alternatives were considered safe, in almost every
scenario evaluated by the department, the direct disposal in grout technology
posed less risk to on-site workers, the general public and the environment,"
Friedman reported.

While acknowledging that burying the waste would create higher radiation levels
at the site, he said the agency should not worry so much about the possibility
of anyone ever building a house on the land.

"There are currently no plans to release the site to residential development
even after the 100 years post-closure mark," he wrote.

Lyman said federal law requires the agency to vitrify high-level waste and send
it to Yucca.

Tom Clements, an official with Greenpeace International, said the
recommendation is being driven by cost.

"The people of South Carolina and Georgia should be concerned that tens of
millions of curies of radiation are simply planned to be mixed with cement and
dumped in ground-level chambers at SRS," he said. "This is a recipe for
long-term ground water contamination and a significant reversal of earlier SRS
waste management philosophy, which the state must protest."

Glenn Carroll, coordinator for Georgians Against Nuclear Energy, said it would
be folly to presume the federal government will control the site for eternity.

"That is not responsible," she said.

Friedman said in his report the agency had not previously chosen direct
disposal because it wanted to extract the cesium, a highly radioactive
compound, for use in a waste immobilization plan. But he noted the agency
canceled those plans earlier this year, choosing instead to convert surplus
plutonium into mixed-oxide, or MOX, fuel for commercial nuclear reactors.

He said the Energy Department also has resisted direct disposal, fearing it
would be difficult to gain public support and regulatory approval. But Friedman
said DHEC officials said they would be willing to look at it.

Thom Berry, a DHEC spokesman, said while his agency will consider such a plan
"that doesn't mean that we are committed to approve it."

The acting manager of Savannah River has not agreed with Friedman's
recommendation.

"We are taking a prudent, step-wise approach and will continually evaluate the
most cost-effective, safe strategy," Jeffrey Allison, acting manager at SRS,
wrote to Friedman.

Waste disposal at the site already is the subject of a federal lawsuit.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group, has
challenged the agency's plan on what to do with residue in the tanks once most
of the liquid is pumped out. The Energy Department sealed two tanks after
filling them with cement, though some waste residue remains. The agency plans
to cover them with dirt.

The NRDC charges that the federal government has arbitrarily and illegally
reclassified the residue to cut costs and speed up closing the tanks.

Friedman noted in his report that "the outcome of this case may bear directly
in future decisions regarding salt waste at Savannah River."

The new nukes

The US is developing a range of handy, 'low-yield' bombs - and it's
prepared to use them. Richard Norton-Taylor reports

Richard Norton-Taylor
Tuesday August 6, 2002
The Guardian

For the first time since the height of the cold war, the US is seriously
contemplating the use of nuclear weapons. But this time they would not
be used, as they would have been then, against another nuclear power. The
proposal is that they would be used against countries developing
weapons of mass destruction - chemical and biological as well as nuclear
weapons.

Last week the Pentagon, for the first time, secured funds from Congress to
develop "mini-nukes", low-yield nuclear weapons designed in
particular to destroy underground bunkers. The plan to build a new
generation of nuclear weapons, military analysts say, is behind the
growing pressure on the White House to withdraw from the comprehensive
test-ban treaty. American nuclear scientists last week also secured
an agreement whereby tests on new warheads could start within a year of any
request, rather than the existing mandatory delay of three years.
They have been instructed to drill new boreholes in the test grounds of the
Nevada desert.

"Part of American thinking is that some tasks cannot be achieved without
using nuclear weapons," says Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies
at the University of Bradford.

All this was foreshadowed by the leaking, in March, of the Pentagon's
"nuclear posture review". The classified document blurs the
long-accepted distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. It
foresees the use of nuclear weapons in three scenarios: against targets
able to withstand attacks by non-nuclear weapons (such as underground
bunkers); in retaliation for an attack with nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons; and "in the event of surprising military developments",
such as an "Iraqi attack on Israel or its neighbours, or a North
Korean attack on South Korea or a military confrontation over the status of
Taiwan".

"North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya are among the countries that
could be involved in immediate, potential or unexpected contingencies,"
it says.

The review shows how the Pentagon unashamedly seeks to claim some kind of
moral high ground: new kinds of nuclear warheads, it says, could
actually reduce "collateral damage". What it is saying is that small
nuclear weapons might kill fewer civilians than conventional weapons.

Such an assertion contradicts scientific studies about the short- and
long-term consequences of radiation resulting from a nuclear blast -
even from a low-yield weapon striking a deep-underground bunker. According
to William Peden, a Greenpeace expert, even a small nuclear
weapon would kill thousands, and thousands more would suffer from burns,
radiation sickness, blindness and other injuries leading to genetic
deformities - as happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A weapon of five
kilotons or even one kiloton - the Hiroshima bomb, regarded today as
tiny, was 15 kilotons - would be extremely dangerous, precisely because the
military would regard it as "usable", Peden says.

The Washington-based Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), which
campaigns for nuclear disarmament, says that an attack on Saddam
Hussein's presidential bunker in Baghdad with a B61-11 bomb, for example,
"could cause upwards of 20,000 deaths".

Even Nato admits that "any nuclear weapons use would be absolutely
catastrophic in human and environmental terms... Such human cost would
ensure an enormous political cost for any nation that chose to use nuclear
weapons, particularly in a first strike."

But, of course, not everyone agrees, or at least not everyone is listening.
One keen advocate of small, precision-guided, low-yield nuclear
weapons is Stephen Younger, a former director of the Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratory and now head of America's Defence Threat
Reduction Agency, responsible for "counter-proliferation" programmes. "
Nuclear weapons pack an incredible destructive force into a small,
deliverable package," Younger wrote last year in a paper entitled Nuclear
Weapons in the 21st Century.

A report published last year by America's National Institute for Public
Policy, a conservative thinktank, declared that "nuclear weapons can...
be used in counter-force attacks that are intended to neutralise enemy
military capabilities".

The authors of the report include Stephen Cambone, now a senior Pentagon
policy-making official; Stephen Hadley, George Bush's deputy
national security adviser; Robert Joseph, a member of the national security
council, and William Schneider, one of Bush's defence advisers.

"The old doctrine was that nuclear weapons were far too big and nasty to
use, and now they've moved towards developing nuclear weapons they
can actually use," says Peden.

And, as the defence analyst Dan Plesch puts it, by developing a
missile-defence system in combination with new nuclear weapons, the Bush
administration is "extending the notion of casualty-free war to nuclear war".

Washington's new policy directly contradicts the so-called "negative
security assurances", the official policy of the US, whereby Washington
has pledged not to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-armed state
"unless that state attacks the US or its allies in association with a
nuclear-weapons state".

Meanwhile, the British government, which abandoned Labour's traditional "no
first use" policy after the 1997 general election, appears to
have adopted the emerging US nuclear doctrine allowing for pre-emptive
strikes against a state that has no weapons of mass destruction, if it
is perceived to be a threat.

Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, told MPs earlier this year: "I am
absolutely confident, in the right conditions, we would be willing to use
our nuclear weapons." However, he also said he was less confident that they
would deter "states of concern" - a reference to Iraq in particular
- from threatening or attacking Britain with weapons of mass destruction.
He later insisted that the government "reserved the right" to use
nuclear weapons if Britain or British troops deployed abroad were
threatened by chemical or biological weapons.

The government has declined to enter into any debate about nuclear weapons
policy, refusing to explain what it meant when it referred to the
Trident missile's "sub-strategic" role in its 1998 strategic defence
review. (The smallest nuclear weapon that Britain's Trident could deliver
now would be 100 kilotons, which is a "city destroyer".)

The government is also investing more than £2bn in the atomic weapons
establishment at Aldermaston, where nuclear warheads are designed.
Scientists from the centre have been stepping up their visits to nuclear
laboratories in the US.

Defenders of nuclear weapons have always insisted that they are needed as a
deterrent. Britain and the US appear to be admitting that this is no
longer the case.

Las Vegas SUN

Defense official: Nuke tests at NTS are likely

By Jace Radke
<jace@lasvegassun.com>
AS VEGAS SUN

Underground nuclear testing could begin at the Nevada Test Site in the next
decade to ensure the reliability of the nation's aging nuclear arsenal, a
Pentagon official said this morning.

Scientists have relied on computer modeling and other analytical tests
since 1992, when the last weapon was detonated at the Test Site.

But Dr. Dale Klein, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's assistant for
nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said that the nation may
need hard data to check the weapons.

"As time goes on there will likely have to be some tests preformed beyond
the small scale," Klein said in an interview at Nellis Air Force Base.
"There is no direct evidence that says we have to test now, but the
stockpile is developing aging characteristics.

"We didn't think they would be in stockpile this long."

Klein, who will visit the Test Site tomorrow, said that while there has
been no official move toward testing yet, he believes it will have to be
done at
some point, perhaps in the next five to 10 years.

"Looking at it from a scientific standpoint you need to have experimental
data, to go along with the modeling and analytical study," Klein said. "Of
course a return to testing would be a very difficult political issue. The
science community looks at it from a standpoint of obtaining knowledge."

It would take two to three years to prepare the Test Site for a nuclear
test, but the Bush Administration has asked for better preparedness so
testing
could be resumed quickly if needed.

Greg Mello, director of the Los Alamos Study Group, an association of
scholars working for nuclear disarmament, disagrees with the need for
future testing.

"The National Academy of Sciences released a study in July that said that
testing is not needed to determine the reliability of the stockpile," Mello
said. "This is nothing more than an ideological-driven agenda by the Bush
administration to systematically undermine the test ban."

The size of any future nuclear experimentation at the Test Site, an Energy
Department facility in the desert 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is
something that would be determined if testing were to be resumed, Klein said.

"Science would drive the size of the testing," Klein said.

The Test Site, which is larger than Rhode Island, was home to more than
1,000 above and below ground nuclear weapons test between 1951 and
1992. It has a series of underground tunnels which have served as
laboratories for many of the tests.

Peggy Maze Johnson, executive director of Citizen's Alert, an environmental
group, said that the idea of resuming testing is unbelievable.

"Did we not learn our lesson the first time?" Johnson asked. "We're paying
millions of dollars to downwinders in Utah. The destruction these tests
cause is just amazing, not only to people, but to the earth."

The fact that the testing would be conducted underground is small comfort
to Johnson.

"We have a groundwater study that we conducted at the Test Site that will
be released in September, and we believe that the Test Site sits right above
the Amargosa River," Johnson said. "Do they think that whatever they do out
there won't seep down into the groundwater?"

Currently the site serves as a training ground for fire, medical and law
enforcement personnel to learn how to respond to domestic terrorism. The
facility's role could expand further with last month's Senate Bill that
grants Nevada $35 million to expand counter-terrorism at the Test Site.

In addition the Energy Department may move an advanced laboratory and its
weapons-grade nuclear materials from Los Alamos, N.M. to the Test
Site because of growing security concerns. In 1997 a mock terrorist attack
by Army Special Forces used a Home Depot shopping cart to take more
than 200 pounds of nuclear materials from the Los Alamos facility.

If nuclear testing were to resume at the Test Site scientists could gain
valuable information, Klein said.

"Whenever testing occurs we'll be able to gain information that couldn't
have been attained 20 years ago, because of how much computers have
improved over that time," Klein said.

Klein is responsible for helping to ensure that the country's nuclear
arsenal is secure and reliable, as well as making certain that the country's
military forces are trained against chemical and biological weapons.

A reassessment of the security of the nation's nuclear weapons was
conducted after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Klein said.

"Our devices are routinely moved, and we've reassessed what kind of
security we use on our transportation paths and bases, as well as examining
what our response would be to an attempt to obtain one of our devices,"
Klein said.

Reactor Sales Are Said to Endanger Accident Payments
August 7, 2002
By MATTHEW L. WALD 

WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 - The sale of about two dozen nuclear
power reactors around the country to a small number of
companies has undermined the system Congress devised to
ensure compensation for people hurt by a severe nuclear
accident, according to an analysis commissioned by two
antinuclear groups in New York. 

Federal law requires reactor operators to buy $200 million
in conventional insurance. It also provides for about $9.3
billion in additional coverage by requiring that after an
accident, each plant pay $10 million a year, up to $88
million, to compensate victims. 

When the law, known as the Price-Anderson act, was approved
by Congress, the idea was to spread the risk among all
reactors. But as a result of recent mergers and purchases,
four companies now own so many reactors that their
liabilities would be more than half a billion dollars each
in case of accidents. 

The study, which was commissioned by Riverkeeper, a Hudson
River environmental group, and the STAR Foundation, a Long
Island antinuclear group, points out that in many cases,
the companies bought the reactors through limited liability
subsidiaries that could declare bankruptcy and permit the
parent corporations to walk away unscathed. It also says
that the limited liability structure jeopardizes the money
set aside for decommissioning the reactors at the end of
their lives. 

"Price-Anderson only works if those companies are reachable
in the event of an accident," said Alex Matthiessen,
executive director of Riverkeeper. "These limited liability
structures seem specifically designed to put them beyond
reach." 

The report, prepared by Synapse Energy Economics and
scheduled to be officially released on Wednesday by being
posted on the World Wide Web at www.noradiation.org,
details layer upon layer of corporate structures used in
recent reactor purchases. Robert Alvarez, program director
for the Star Foundation, said that most of the holding
companies had no employees and were merely "shell
corporations." He called them " Enron-style subsidiaries." 

Representatives for the nuclear industry scoffed at the
idea that the changes in ownership threatened the insurance
system. Having nuclear plants concentrated in the hands of
companies that specialize in running reactors has safety
benefits, they said, and may also create greater financial
responsiveness. 

"If I'm a nuclear operator, I'm not going to undermine my
core business to save $10 million a year," said Marvin S.
Fertel, senior vice president at the Nuclear Energy
Institute, a trade group. Failure to pay the fee for one
reactor could jeopardize the licenses of the others, he
said. 

A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant has fuel and
operating expenses of $130 million to $140 million a year,
he said, and a $10 million payment on top of that, in the
unlikely event of a major accident, was a small increment. 

In an introduction to the report, Peter A. Bradford, a
former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a
former head of the public service commissions in both New
York State and Vermont, agreed that the consolidation of
nuclear ownership might make for safer operation. But he
said he thought it also "risks the shifting of accident and
decommissioning costs from the plant owners to the general
public because the relatively secure financial backing of
substantial utilities companies has, in many cases, been
replaced by a limited liability subsidiary whose only asset
is an individual nuclear power plant." 

Price-Anderson, established in 1957 by Congress, expired on
Aug. 1. Provisions remain in force for existing reactors
but new ones would not be covered. But that point is moot,
since no new reactors have been ordered since 1978. 

The insurance system established by the law could be
crucial for people who live within a few miles of nuclear
plants because commercial property insurance does not cover
radiation accidents. 

In creating the program, Congress set a cap on how much
would be paid to any victims of a nuclear accident. The cap
is periodically adjusted for inflation; it is now about
$9.5 billion, with the money coming from the $200 million
in conventional insurance and the $9.3 billion that would
be paid by the nuclear industry after an accident. 

Opponents say the cap is a subsidy to the nuclear industry;
the industry asserts that the $9.5 billion is far more than
would be available for a catastrophe at a chemical plant or
some other industrial site. So far, they point out,
payments have totaled only about $200 million. 

Whatever the merits of the arguments on both sides, the
emerging structure of the industry has clearly changed the
underlying assumptions behind the building of nuclear power
plants. Critics agree that having a single company operate
15 or 20 reactors is probably good for safety, since plants
within a company share expertise more readily than plants
owned by scattered utilities. 

But they also say that the new owners may lack the deep
pockets of the mammoth regulated utilities that built the
reactors, making an insurance scheme more necessary. 

The new legal structure is radically different from what
came before. For example, the Indian Point reactors, in a
suburb of New York City along the Hudson River, were sold
by Consolidated Edison and the New York Power Authority to
Entergy, a utility that built five of its own plants and
has bought six more. 

A spokesman for Entergy, Carl Crawford, said the structure
had tax advantages. Asked if it also created a liability
shield, he said, "It has that effect, too." 

But, he said, "anyone who thinks that a company that would
spend a billion and a half of its own dollars is going to
shirk a $10 million a year insurance payment, that's just
not reasonable."

In the past year, nuclear contamination was discovered near Route 66,
running along the site of the former Nuclear Materials and Equipment
Corp. plutonium processing plant in Parks Township.

It's been there, undetected, for almost four decades without fences or
warning signs.

The recent episodes of contamination - more was found uphill of the
nuclear waste dump there, near Kiskimere Road - add to a growing list of
potential hazards at the Parks site.

The nuclear burial grounds this year were expanded by about a third of
their former size, while trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination from the
Parks site seeps into the Kiski River.

Last year, while surveying the boundaries of the burial area - about 14
acres - elevated levels of radiation were discovered along with a piece
of contaminated scrap metal. All of the contamination was discovered on
land outside the the burial area.

"They need to test and find out pretty soon what's there," said Raymond
Hunter, 61, of Kiskimere. He lives within 100 yards of the fence line
from the burial grounds.

"Sometimes kids go back there and play in those woods," Hunter said of
the unfenced area that BWX Technologies (formerly B&W and the license
holder for the burial grounds) recently asked to be added to the burial
ground land that needs to be cleaned up. "I've got grandchildren who are
growing up around the area."

The recently discovered contamination dates back to 1965, when several
burial pits were exhumed because the owner, NUMEC, was looking for
hundreds of pounds of missing uranium. The lost material led to
allegations that NUMEC had given the uranium to Israel to build its
nuclear arsenal.

The contents of the pits were dug by picks and shovels by company
workers, who wore no protective clothing. Contaminated materials were
spread over the burial grounds, and according to a former worker, the
piles of radioactive material reached the tree line - well beyond the
fenced boundaries of the burial grounds.

During the exhumation, TCE-like liquid drained from the pits.

"Lots of TCE was buried there - drums - and the old drums easily
punctured," said Mike Zerby of Washington Township, a former NUMEC
employee who participated in the dig. "We worked in that smell for
months.

"That dragline lifted gobs of mess. We tried with a Geiger counter. It
was all hot," said Zerby, who worked on the exhumation for six months.

"These hands had more bare, highly enriched uranium on them than other
people's hands."

After the 1965 exhumation, the contaminated materials lay in the open,
above ground, for at least a year. Then the debris was either reburied
or burned, according to company and government documents obtained by the
Valley News Dispatch.

BWXT received approval from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
add the contaminated land to the burial site in June.

Although BWXT holds the license for the site, the Atlantic Richfield
Company (ARCO), former owner of the site, is financially responsible for
the burial grounds under the agreement that transferred the license to
BWXT.

TCE contamination

Officials from the state Department of Environmental Protection, which
provides oversight for the chemical waste cleanup, want more tests on
the extent and concentration of TCE contamination in the Kiski River.

Although the river samples reveal TCE contamination at levels safe to
the general public, DEP wants more extensive testing at the facility
site.

TCE is a toxic liquid commonly used as a solvent. According to the EPA,
life-time exposure to elevated levels of TCE can cause cancer and liver
damage.

The first plume of TCE found in the river is coming from the former
plutonium fuel processing site along Route 66. One of the sources for
the TCE contamination at the facility site was a drum field with leaky
TCE containers, up hill from the facility.

Additionally, TCE may have been dumped directly into the ground at the
drum field in the 1960s, according to a 1996 deposition by former B&W
executive R.V. Carlson.

Carlson said there was no proof that workers dumped the TCE, only
stories.

The origin of what could be a second plume of contamination into the
river is unknown. BWXT officials say it's not coming from their site,
while the DEP wants more tests on the BWXT land to find the source.

BWXT must submit a site characterization plan - an assessment of
contamination in the environment - to the state, said John Matviya,
environmental cleanup manager for the DEP.

After the company submits the plan, Matviya said, "then we'll know what
type of remediation will be necessary."

DEP testing found 1.98 parts per billion of TCE in the river adjacent to
the BWXT site. The state standard for in-stream water is 2.76 parts per
billion.

But just downstream from the BWXT site, DEP found TCE contamination at
8.47 parts per billion - more than three times the allowable limit - in
a gully that leads to the Kiski. The gully is a "dry run," meaning it
only flows with water during the spring thaw or heavy rains.

The water in the river at the mouth of the gully has 0.49 parts per
billion of TCE, according to DEP tests.

BWXT project manager Rich Bartosik said the gully contamination is not
coming from the BWXT property.

However, DEP officials disagree.

Matviya said more testing is needed to determine the source of TCE going
into the gully, and the BWXT property needs further examination.

TCE was first documented in the Kiski River in 1995 in a Babcock &
Wilcox report, Bartosik said. The TCE plume under the plant site was
discovered in the early 1990s.

Uranium in the mines

The water in the underground mines is contaminated with man-made
uranium, but the extent is unknown, according to officials from the
state DEP.

"If the contaminant from Parks facility can get into the mines at
sufficient concentrations, it could pose a potential threat," Matviya
said.

"I don't see it as a huge significance at this point," Matviya said.
"But it may be enough to be of concern. We have to look further and see
what the potential is."

Man-made uranium was found by tests conducted by the companies on a coal
pillar beneath trench 10, the state officials said.

"To determine the extent of the contamination would be like trying to
find a needle in a hay stack" according to Fred Baldassare, a DEP
hydrogeologist.

The flow of the water in the underground mines is erratic and difficult
to pinpoint from the surface, he said.

Plutonium cleaned up

Plutonium and another radioactive toxin, americium 241, were discovered
last year at the Parks site and its neighbor, Cook Vascular, a medical
supply company built on land formerly owned by ARCO and NUMEC.

The contamination was identified and cleaned up by BWXT last year.

The contamination stemmed from soil dug up in the mid-1960s from the
plutonium processing plant land that was allowed to remain unprotected
for more than 30 years.

The contamination passed under the radar of the NRC.

"In general, the focus of the sampling relative to a licensed facility
is traditionally focused on the licensed area," said Amir Kouhestani,
NRC project manager for the Parks site.

"These are legacy sites," Kouhestani said. "Record keeping was not the
ideal thing. You have 50 years of history, and people come and go."

And the area contaminated on the Cook property was dormant, Kouhestani
said.

"Any private property concern has been properly addressed by the
licensee regarding any potential of migration," he said.

Underground hazard

The catacomb of underground mines poses a threat to stability of the
site, according to some experts. The mines also serve as a focal point
in the argument to remove the contaminated materials instead of leaving
them in place indefinitely - as has been suggested.

Mine subsidence has occurred in the Parks area and methane gas lingers
in the mines.

In September 1997, two teenage boys were burned from a methane gas
explosion from a mine entrance off of Airport Road in Parks Township.

The boys were set to explore the coal mine when one of them lit a match,
which ignited the methane gas.

"It's an unprecedented situation to have a mine under a radioactive
waste dump," said Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy
and Environmental Research in Takoma Park, Md.

"A safety analysis would be warranted, especially since uranium was
detected in the mine water, he said.

DEP officials have been concerned about the mines and their proximity to
the burial trenches.

"It's impossible to say that there has been no mine subsidence at the
Parks site," said Sam Harper, chief of environmental cleanup for DEP.
"If there hasn't been subsidence, in time there will be subsidence."

Subsidence at the Park site could cause contamination from the trenches
to migrate off site, Matviya said.

"Contaminants can and have found their way into the mine workings and
flow out of mine," Matviya said. "There's dilution, but it needs to be
addressed."

The mine stability was questioned in a report from the United
Steelworkers of America in 1987. The area of underground mines under and
near the burial trenches is susceptible to high numbers of damaging
mine-subsidence events. The report was not specific to the mines
directly underneath the burial grounds.

Another concern is the possibility of a mine fire.

"It's an issue when you have coal and have a fire," Harper said. "It
can't be put out." Although, he said, mine fires can be quenched but it
can take years.

Mine fires can burn for decades and increase the possibility of
subsidence by weakening the roof of the mine.

WIPP Returns Waste Container

The Associated Press

CARLSBAD - The federal government's nuclear waste dump near Carlsbad has
returned one of two nuclear waste containers involved in a traffic accident
to an Idaho lab because of possible contamination.

The two containers were being taken to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
when the transport truck was struck from behind by a drunken driver before
dawn Sunday.

It was the first accident involving a WIPP truck, and the returned waste
container was also the first in the history of the project, said Kerry
Watson, assistant manager for the U.S. Energy Department's National TRU
Waste Program.

Attributing the possible contamination to Sunday's accident would be
pure speculation, Watson said.

"We don't want to speculate as to why it happened," he said. "There are
a whole multitude of potential causes, none of which compromised the
integrity of the TRUPACT."

At the accident scene, authorities inspected the truck and no release of
hazardous materials was found, WIPP officials said.

Watson said the possible contamination was discovered inside one of the
containers after it was examined at WIPP. There was no contamination on the
exterior, he said.

When air was drawn out of the interior of the vessel and pulled through
a filter, a potential problem was detected, Watson said.

"We did subsequent testing and analysis and determined there were some
kind of airborne transuranic isotopes inside the TRUPACT," he said.
Instead of opening the container, WIPP officials on Wednesday returned
it to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory for
further inspection. The Idaho site has facilities designed to handle large,
contaminated items, Watson said.

Meanwhile, the man who crashed his pickup into the back of the WIPP
truck pleaded no contest Monday to charges of drunken driving, careless
driving, driving without a license and a minor in possession of alcohol.
Israel Alvidrez, 19, of Seminole, Texas, was allowed to return home
pending a Sept. 16 sentencing hearing. He faces up to 15 months in jail and
more than $900 in fines.

Ohio Atomic Plant Is Investigated Over Acid Leak
September 1, 2002
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 

CLEVELAND, Aug. 31 - Federal regulators are investigating
accusations that the owner of a nuclear plant where acid
nearly ate through a six-inch-thick steel reactor cap
altered records about the damage, the company said. 

Todd Schneider, a spokesman for the company, FirstEnergy
Corporation, said the utility was cooperating with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission but he would not provide
details of the investigation at the Davis-Besse plant near
Toledo. 

"Allegations of altered documents and records are part of
this investigation," Mr. Schneider said. 

The plant has been closed since engineers discovered in
March that boric acid had nearly eaten through the steel
cap on the reactor vessel. It was the most extensive
corrosion ever found on a nuclear reactor in the United
States and led to a nationwide review of all 69 similar
plants. 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said the leak that
caused it should have been spotted as long as four years
ago. An agency spokesman, Jan Strasma, would not confirm
that officials were investigating whether FirstEnergy had
altered records. 

A coalition of 14 environmental and nuclear watchdog groups
is urging the agency to order an independent review of the
plant. 

A coalition spokesman, David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer,
said investigators told him that the agency was studying
whether FirstEnergy backdated videotapes, falsified
documents and withheld a photograph to make damage seem
less severe than it was. 

Workers removed the damaged reactor head on Thursday and
were to begin installing a replacement. The plant is
expected to be operational by October, Mr. Schneider said.

New Uranium Plant Will Be in Tennessee

September 10, 2002

WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 - A partnership of American, Canadian
and European nuclear companies that is seeking to build the
first new uranium enrichment plant in this country in 50
years said today that it had selected a site, in
Hartsville, Tenn., for the $1.1 billion project, state
officials said today. Officials said the partnership hoped
to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license
by the end of the year.
The Tennessee Valley Authority tried to build a nuclear
reactor there but abandoned it in the 1980's because of
high costs. Today's announcement was made by Tennessee's
governor, Don Sundquist.
The consortium, Louisiana Energy Services, based in
Washington, is made up of Urenco, a European enrichment
company; Cameco, a Canadian uranium company; and three
major nuclear power plant operators in this country:
Exelon, Duke Energy and Entergy. The company that operates
the only enrichment plant now running in this country,
USEC, is also seeking to build a new plant.
Both planned enrichment plants would be similar in
technology to the one that American intelligence experts
say that Saddam Hussein is trying to build in Iraq. The
American plants, however, would produce low-enriched
uranium, suitable for power reactors but not bombs.

This Is The Place For Waste 
Sunday, September 8, 2002
BY BRENT ISRAELSEN 
(c) 2002, THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE 

SKULL VALLEY -- Venturing through this dry, mostly barren place, visitors might
think they are in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by a vast wasteland.

They would be only partially correct.  Skull Valley is not nowhere. It is home
to a tiny band of Goshute Indians. But their reservation is in the middle of a
wasteland.

Within a 30-mile radius of Skull Valley is a bombing range, a testing ground for
chemical and biological defense, a chemical-weapons incinerator, a
hazardous-waste landfill, a low-level radioactive waste landfill, two
hazardous-waste incinerators and a magnesium plant that is among the nation's
biggest air polluters.

Led by tribal Chairman Leon Bear, the Goshutes hope to become part of this toxic
industrial complex with a proposal that would bring much of the nation's
high-level nuclear power plant waste to Skull Valley.

The proposal, designed and backed by a consortium of out-of-state utilities
known as Private Fuel Storage (PFS), is fiercely contested by the state, with
Gov. Mike Leavitt taking an "over my dead body" posture.

Truth be known, Utah has in the past willingly partnered with the nation's
nuclear and military complex.

Utah leaders embraced the Department of Defense when it set up shop during World
War II and the Cold War and later encouraged waste-related and polluting
enterprises in Tooele County, giving the rest of the nation the impression that
this is the place for waste.

An examination of modern history in Tooele County shows an evolution of events
and policies that makes the Goshute initiative appear perfectly natural.

When Brigham Young declared the Salt Lake Valley "the right place" for the new
Mormon Zion, several thousand Goshute Indians roamed about 7 million acres of
the Great Basin to the west, hunting and gathering food in a series of valleys
and mountain ranges.

As Mormon settlers moved into what is now Tooele County, the Goshutes, having
already survived frequent raids by slave traders serving Spanish markets in New
Mexico and California, began feeling a major squeeze on their delicately
balanced way of life. The settlers diverted streams for agriculture, turned
livestock onto the range and cut down trees for lumber.

The "spread of Mormons throughout the region . . . had a pronounced effect on
the Indians," wrote Dennis Defa in A History of Utah's Native Americans.

Trails to California and the transcontinental railroad further fragmented the
Goshute lands, leading to armed conflict and a marginalization of the Indians.
Eventually, they were confined to two reservations. The Confederated Tribe of
the Goshutes occupies a 412,000-acre reservation near the Utah-Nevada border at
Ibapah. The Skull Valley Band's land totals 18,000 acres.

The plight of the Goshutes was noted by a mid-19th-century writer, who called
them "the wretchedest type of mankind" inhabiting "one of the most . . .
repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit."

By "repulsive wastes," of course, Mark Twain was referring to the harsh
landscape. As time went on, and non-Indians began heaping all manner of
dangerous material into a desert that once sustained an American Indian culture,
the term would take a more literal meaning.

Of Guns and Germs: A year after the United States was thrust into World War II,
President Roosevelt deeded 127,000 acres of land around Dugway to the War
Department for weapons testing.

Dugway Proving Ground's mission quickly expanded to include chemical and
biological weapons. For the past 60 years, Dugway, 10 miles southwest of Skull
Valley, has played host to the nation's top biologists and chemists, who have
conducted thousands of classified experiments.

The experiments sometimes have involved animal and human subjects. And
sometimes, they have gone awry.

In 1968, for example, a fighter jet sprayed nerve gas that drifted onto a nearby
grazing allotment, killing 6,000 sheep within days. The military quietly
gathered the carcasses and buried some of them in Skull Valley, without the
tribe's permission.

Dugway continues to play a key role today in the nation's defense against
biological and chemical attack. Dozens of deadly microbes, including the germs
that cause anthrax and the plague, are stored in the facility's laboratories.

To the north and west of Dugway, millions of acres of federal lands were
designated bombing ranges for air-to-ground combat practice and medium-range
missile launches. Each year, millions of rounds of ordnance are fired into the
desert, mostly from jet fighters based at Hill Air Force Base, northern Utah's
biggest employer.

As the nuclear-arms race with the Soviet Union reached a crescendo in the 1970s,
the Defense Department proposed locating the MX program, a network of
underground intercontinental ballistic missiles in western Utah. The proposal
died after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints publicly opposed it.

But in the chemical-arms race, about 42 percent of the nation's stockpile --
more than enough to kill every human on the planet -- was stored in bunkers at
the Army's Deseret Chemical Depot, about 15 miles southeast of Skull Valley.

Munitions filled with nerve and mustard agent are now being destroyed in a
controversial incinerator that has been plagued with technical difficulties,
including a handful of small accidental releases that have exposed workers and
the environment to nerve gas.

Farther south, Utah reaped the benefits of numerous uranium mines and mills,
which fed the nuclear-weapons program in neighboring southern Nevada.

While state officials later decried above-ground nuclear testing when it was
discovered to be a likely cause of cancer in southern Utah, the state has been
relatively quiet in its criticism of what has occurred in the basins and ranges
of Tooele County.

"That was in an era when we were pretty poor and desperate for revenue and jobs.
We welcomed" military activity, says Chip Ward, an activist from Grantsville and
author of Canaries on the Rim, an environmental history of Utah's western
desert.

Milking the Magnesium: In Tooele County, the military use of the desert for
dangerous activities encouraged the private sector to look there for
opportunity.

In the early 1970s, a group of investors, including the former owner of The Salt
Lake Tribune, built a magnesium plant on the southwestern shore of the Great
Salt Lake, about 25 miles north of Skull Valley.

Far from heavily populated areas, the site was perfect for a "dirty" industry
that extracted magnesium from the briny waters of the nation's largest inland
sea.

The plant, which came to be known as MagCorp, spews copious quantities of
chlorine into the air and lands frequently at the top of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's list of air polluters. In the late 1990s, the EPA also
discovered the plant was emitting dioxin, a highly carcinogenic compound.

MagCorp (reborn as U.S. Magnesium) has begun cleaning up its chlorine and dioxin
emissions, but bankruptcy and a recent reorganization have put those efforts
into question.

DOE Cleans Up: From 1951 to 1968, a uranium processing plant known as the Vitro
mill operated near what is now 3300 South and Interstate 15.

In the 1970s, as suburbia approached, the abandoned mill site's tailings became
a health and environmental risk.

Under pressure from the state and Salt Lake County governments, the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) decided to remove the tailings. The state's suggested
destination was Clive, about 55 miles west of Salt Lake City, and about 15 miles
northwest of Skull Valley.

The state viewed the western desert, with its low precipitation and distance
from water sources and population centers, as an ideal place for dangerous
materials.

"What really brought [the hazardous waste industry] to Tooele County was the
state," says county planner Nicole Cline, who is compiling a history of the
county's waste industry. "Tooele County didn't want Vitro waste out here. The
state did quite a bit to get [the county] to buy into it."

The Vitro tailings project later inspired an enterprising immigrant to
capitalize on the nation's newfound interest in disposing of hazardous wastes
and cleaning up DOE sites from around the country.

One Man's Waste: As Vitro tailings were being entombed at Clive, Khosrow
Semnani, a Utah-educated native of Iran, opened a hazardous-waste landfill at
Grassy Mountain, about eight miles north, on the other side of Interstate 80.

The landfill disposed of nonradioactive chemicals. such as paint and pesticides.
too dangerous to be disposed of in city dumps.

He later sold the facility to U.S. Pollution Control Inc. (USPCI), which
subsequently built a hazardous-waste incinerator near Clive to compete with one
that Westinghouse had built at Aragonite, about 10 miles away. (The incinerator
at Clive closed in 1997 for lack of business.)

A few years after the Vitro project was completed, Semnani purchased lands
surrounding the disposal site and sought state and federal licenses to develop a
commercial landfill that would accept similar radioactive wastes.

He named his operation Envirocare of Utah, which began accepting wastes in 1988.

Today, Envirocare is the largest private disposal site in the country for
low-level radioactive wastes and "mixed wastes," such as soils tainted by both
radiation and hazardous chemicals. It has been highly profitable, both to
Semnani and to Tooele County, which reaps 5 percent of the Envirocare's gross
revenues, last year estimated around $120 million.

Laidlaw, which owned the Grassy Mountain landfill in the late 1990s, tried to
compete with Envirocare for low-level radioactive waste disposal but was
rebuffed by the Tooele County Commission, which ruled the market could not
support two such facilities.

Semnani, one of the most active players on the Utah political campaign-finance
scene, has sought to expand his business to include "hotter" low-level wastes,
such as construction material, clothing and tools contaminated by nuclear power
generation.

Though Tooele County has approved Semnani's latest proposal, the state has put
it on hold, mainly out of concern that state support of Semnani's proposal would
make its opposition of the Goshute proposal less credible.

Meanwhile, the Goshutes: To Bear -- whose tribe has realized few rewards from
the Tooele County waste industry and has been prevented by state law from
capitalizing on casino gambling -- the state's opposition to the Goshute venture
is perplexing.

"The [county] has designated [parts of Tooele County] as an industrial waste
zone," Bear says. "We've found something that fits in with that designation, and
the state doesn't like it."

In its urgency to find a place for its waste, the nuclear power industry views
Utah's west desert as an ideal site -- much the same way the state viewed Tooele
County when it had to rid Salt Lake County of the Vitro tailings.

But Leavitt argues that the high-level nuclear waste, which remains dangerous
for at least 10,000 years, is significantly more hazardous than anything that
has been disposed of before in the western desert. Besides, he says, Utah
already has its share of the nation's waste and nuclear fallout and should not
be the resting place for spent nuclear fuel the state did not even consume.

John Parkyn, chairman of Private Fuel Storage, finds Leavitt's arguments
disingenuous, noting Utah's economy has benefitted from mining and processing
much of the uranium that has nourished the nuclear industry.

Nuclear power, he says, has played a significant role in meeting the nation's
demand for electricity, driving the national economy.

For decades, residents living near the plants have endured the risks of that
power. Now, it is Utah's turn to share the burden, Parkyn says.

"We're all in this together."

WIPP suffers second traffic accident
By Victoria Parker-Stevens
Current-Argus Staff Writer

CARLSBAD - A truck carrying nuclear waste from Idaho left the road in Wyoming
Saturday morning, less than two weeks after the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's
first traffic accident.

The Aug. 25 incident near Carlsbad, which was allegedly caused by a drunk
pickup driver, also involved a shipment from Idaho.

No one was injured in either accident, and there was no release of
contaminants, WIPP officials said.

On Saturday, all shipments to WIPP were suspended for about 24 hours, while the
incident was reviewed with all WIPP drivers, said Ines Triay, manager of the
federal Energy Department's Carlsbad Area Field Office.

An Energy Department team was also heading to Idaho to check the TRUPACTs
involved.

The accident occurred at 12:50 a.m. Saturday, when the driver of a WIPP truck
said he felt ill and attempted to pull over to the side of the road. The truck
was headed eastbound on Interstate 80, 11 miles west of Green River, Wyo.

Before the driver made it to the roadside, he blacked out, said Kerry Watson,
assistant manager for the federal Energy Department's National TRU Waste
Program.

The truck crossed the median, headed across the westbound lane and left the
road.

The driver did not have a known ailment and had recently passed a physical
required by the Department of Transportation, Watson said.

The truck's second driver was in the cab's sleeper compartment and woke up when
the truck went off the road. It is permissible for the second driver to be in
the sleeper, Watson said.

The second driver saw the driver slumped over the steering wheel and made sure
the truck's brakes were set. He notified the WIPP central monitoring room,
which contacted Wyoming state police about the accident.

The driver of a vehicle on the highway that witnessed the accident also called
911, Watson said.

State police and an ambulance crew responded, and the driver, who had regained
consciousness, was taken to a nearby hospital.

There was some minor damage to the tractor, but not to the trailer or the
TRUPACT-II shipping containers, Watson said.

The tractor was towed out of a field along the road and taken - with a state
police escort - via an access road to a nearby state police facility in Rock
Springs, Wyo.

There, drivers and state police conducted a Commercial Vehicle Safety
Alliance-6 inspection, the highest inspection level, which includes
radiological testing. It is the same inspection given to WIPP trucks when they
cross state lines.

The inspection verified there was no damage to the TRUPACTs nor any release of
contaminants, Watson said.

A truck that was heading back to Idaho from WIPP with empty TRUPACTs was
diverted to Rock Springs, and the TRUPACTs with waste were placed on the
undamaged trailer.

Instead of continuing on to WIPP, the shipment of waste was returned to Idaho.

Watson said this was the most prudent course of action in light of the return
of a TRUPACT to Idaho after the Aug. 25 accident.

Possible contamination had been detected on the interior of that TRUPACT at the
WIPP site, although WIPP officials have said they do not want to connect the
two events, especially since the outside of the TRUPACT was not damaged in the
accident.

The second driver involved in Saturday's accident went to a motel to rest,
while another trailer was taken to Wyoming to transport the empty containers to
Idaho today, Watson said.

As a precautionary measure, an Energy Department team from Carlsbad is also
being sent to Idaho to re-inspect the TRUPACTs to make sure there is no
internal contamination, he said.

Shipments from all sites were also halted for about 24 hours, while the
incident was reviewed with all drivers.

"We want to make sure everybody understands this incident, Triay said. "We want
to talk to them about the importance of keeping the excellent safety record we
have to date.

The drivers involved in Saturday's accident are based in Carlsbad. One lives in
Carlsbad, and one in Jal, according to the trucking company. No further
information was available.

State police declined to release information about the incident over the
weekend.

U.S. Nuclear Guards Said Overworked, Undertrained
By REUTERS
Filed at 0:08 a.m. ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Guards at the nation's 103 nuclear power plants
are overworked, undertrained and outgunned and some of them doubt they
could repel a terrorist attack, a study by a government watchdog group
said on Thursday.

Interviews with 22 guards at 13 U.S. nuclear power plants revealed
many had doubts about preparedness and training, the Project on
Government Oversight reported.

The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which is
rethinking industry security guidelines in the wake of last year's
deadly attacks on Washington and New York, criticized the study for
relying on "a very thin sample" of the 6,000 guards posted at U.S.
nuclear plants.

Almost a year to the day after the attacks, the NRC on Tuesday advised
nuclear plant operators to boost their security levels after the
government issued a general alert for a possible terrorist attack.

Al Qaeda, the Islamic extremist network Washington blames for the
hijack attacks, may have singled out U.S. nuclear power plants as a
possible target.

"It is prudent to assume that al Qaeda may consider nuclear
facilities as potential targets," NRC Chairman Richard Meserve said
at an industry event on Wednesday.

The non-profit watchdog group said it found nuclear plant owners have
ordered only minimal increases in the number of guards, and are
relying heavily on overtime for existing guards rather than hiring new
ones.

Some guards interviewed by the advocacy group said they worked 12-hour
shifts for up to six consecutive days. Most guards interviewed
"believe that they are still below adequate levels to defeat a real
terrorist attack," the group said.

"If an attack took place, most of the guards would run like hell,"
one guard told the group in an interview.

Guards said they were plagued by fatigue during long and tedious night
shifts. "There's a major problem with guards sleeping, especially on
the night shift," one guard said.

GUARDS WORKING 'EXTENSIVE OVERTIME'

Meserve acknowledged that some U.S. utilities have used "extensive
overtime" to maintain security while they carry out "extensive new
hiring" of guards as part of a post-Sept. 11 push to boost security.

With a total of 6,000 guards at U.S. nuclear facilities, the report
used "a very thin sample in which to draw very profound
conclusions," Meserve told reporters.

"The security at nuclear plants is very strong and the plants have
the inherent capacity to withstand severe events of all types
including those that might be attempted by terrorists," Meserve said.

The Project for Government Oversight defended its report.

"The vast majority of the concerns the guards raise ring absolutely
true," said researcher Pete Stockton. "They believe they don't have
a chance" against an attack, he said.

The Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobby, called the report
"an insult to the 6,000 highly trained, well-armed security
officers" defending nuclear plants.

Most guards interviewed by the advocacy group said they practice
firing their weapons only once or twice a year during annual
qualification tests, far less than the time necessary to become and
remain proficient, the report said.

Guards also told the group they did not feel adequately equipped to
deal with attackers. Many guards have only shotguns while attackers
would likely be armed with sophisticated assault rifles, grenades and
automatic weapons, Stockton said.

In the event of an attack, plant guards "would be seriously
outgunned, and won't have a chance," one told the group.

Some Democrats have sought to impose tougher security at nuclear power
plants. "Nuclear power plants are at the very top of the target list
and their security must be permanently upgraded," said Rep. Edward
Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat backing legislation to give guards
authority to use deadly force against attackers.

Texas Declines Offer of Free Pills for Residents Near Nuclear Plants
New York Times Syndicate (September 4, 2002)

Texas officials have decided not to order free cancer-blocking pills for
residents near the state's two nuclear power plants, fearing that the pills
will provide a false sense of security in case of an accident or attack.

"Honestly, a rapid, timely evacuation is the best way to protect public health
in the event of an accident," said Arthur Tate, director of the division of
compliance and inspection for the Texas Department of Health.

Potassium iodide, a salt, can protect against thyroid cancer in the event of a
nuclear accident. The medication fills a person's thyroid so there is no room
for the radioactive material to be absorbed.

At least 16 other states, half of those that have nuclear power plants, have
taken advantage of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's offer to provide the
pills for residents living within a 10-mile radius of a nuclear plant.

Advocates said the pills can provide a low-cost prevention against a known
risk, thyroid cancer, if used in conjunction with evacuation.

But the pills protect against only one type of radiation - radioactive iodine -
and are not considered an effective defense against a so-called dirty bomb,
which is likely to be contaminated by a variety of radioactive materials, Tate
said.

In the case of an accident or attack, radioactive iodine will probably be only
one harmful component of the plume, he said.

"This has been looked at by a lot of people as an anti-radiation drug and that
is just not the case," he said.

Texas keeps the pills on hand for emergency workers at both nuclear plant
sites, as well as for prisoners, nursing-home residents and others who can't be
moved easily, Tate said.

When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made its post-Sept. 11 offer of the free
pills, health officials consulted with several groups, including local
officials near the power plants - the Comanche Peak site near Glen Rose
southwest of Fort Worth and the South Texas Project plant near Bay City
southwest of Houston - before deciding not to order any, Tate said.

By late August, more than 9 million of the free pills had been requested by
states, said Roger Hannah, a commission spokesman. The cost of supplying the
pills, which have a shelf life of at least five years, has been about $1.6
million, he said.

Massachusetts requested about 660,000 for residents living in the 10-mile zone.

"After Sept. 11, we received a lot of phone calls from a lot of concerned
people in and around these nuclear power plants," said Roseanne Pawelec, a
Massachusetts health department spokeswoman. "It was literally a no-brainer to
take advantage of a free supply. It would have been irresponsible not to."

Some doctors said the pills should be distributed beyond a 10-mile limit.

American Thyroid Association officials, pointing out that it's unclear how far
nuclear fallout would spread, recommend distributing the pills in advance to
residents living within a 50-mile radius. Within 200 miles, the pills should be
stockpiled at schools, post offices, hospitals and other locations that can
easily be accessed, the association said.

The thyroid, a gland at the base of the neck, makes hormones that can influence
metabolism throughout the body, including energy levels and concentration, said
Dr. Steven Sherman, a thyroid cancer specialist at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

The thyroid is particularly vulnerable because radioactive iodine concentrates
there, building up to levels 40 to 100 times those found in the bloodstream, he
said.

"Then there is the possibility that the radiation will cause mutation in
thyroid cells that will lead to the development of thyroid tumors - both benign
and malignant," he said.

The pills should ideally be taken before someone is exposed to radioactive
iodine, such as when a radiation leak is announced, Sherman said. But even
within the first hours after exposure, they should work, he said.

Sherman and other advocates of potassium iodide point to the lessons learned in
the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident.

Beginning four years after the accident, the cases of thyroid cancer among
children and adolescents in the path of the radioactive plume shot up,
sometimes as much as 30 to 60 times the pre-accident rates, according to a 2001
Food and Drug Administration paper.

Massachusetts officials held public hearings in communities last fall and
earlier this year before developing a plan, Pawelec said. This summer, they
began making the pills available - two for each household member living within
the 10-mile radius.

Only one pill will be provided to each household member, Pawelec said.
Residents will be given the second pill outside the evacuation zone. A pill's
effect lasts about 24 hours, according to the FDA.

"The idea being that, obviously, evacuation is still the most important
component of any protection plan or safety plan," Pawelec said

But Walter Maynard, county judge for Somervell County, home of the Comanche
Peak plant, said the logistics of distributing the pills to the general
population would be difficult. For example, he said, even if people pick them
up, how often should officials survey residents to make sure they still have
them in their cabinets?

And, he stressed: "We think people would not evacuate when they need to."

Sherman doesn't buy that argument.

"I think that is both a paternalistic attitude and underestimates the common
sense of most people," he said.

More Sci- Than Fi, Physicists Create Antimatter
By DENNIS OVERBYE

Physicists working in Europe announced yesterday that they had passed through nature's
looking glass and had created atoms made of antimatter, or antiatoms, opening up the
possibility of experiments in a realm once reserved for science fiction writers. Such
experiments, theorists say, could test some of the basic tenets of modern physics and
light the way to a deeper understanding of nature.

Matter and antimatter are like the good and evil twins of nature; they are endowed with
equal and opposite characteristics like charge and spin, so if they meet they obliterate
each other, releasing a flash of energy upon contact.

Weird as it sounds, antimatter is a normal feature of the real, unfictional universe.
Scientists see the creation of antihydrogen atoms as the first step toward testing some
physicists' deepest notions about nature, which hold that antimatter should look and
behave identically to ordinary matter.

For example, any violation of the expected symmetry between hydrogen and antihydrogen
would rock physics to its core.

The new research was conducted by physicists at CERN, the particle physics laboratory
outside Geneva.

By corralling clouds of antimatter particles in a cylindrical chamber laced with
detectors and electric and magnetic fields, the physicists assembled antihydrogen atoms,
the looking glass equivalent of hydrogen, the most simple atom in nature. Whereas
hydrogen consists of a positively charged proton circled by a negatively charged
electron, in antihydrogen the proton's counterpart, a negatively charged antiproton, is
circled by an antielectron, otherwise known as a positron.

They then observed the flashes of energy when the new antihydrogen atoms annihilated
themselves in collisions with ordinary matter in the walls of the chamber.

At least 50,000 antihydrogen atoms have been created since the experiment began in
August, said Dr. Jeffrey S. Hangst, from Aarhus University in Denmark, who coordinated
efforts by 39 physicists from 10 institutions in a collaboration named Athena. A paper on
their results has been accepted for publication in Nature and was posted on its Web site
www.nature.com/nature.

While antihydrogen atoms have been glimpsed in CERN experiments before, this is the first
time they are being produced under circumstances that might eventually permit their
detailed study, the scientists say.

"It's very exciting to see the production of antihydrogen," said Dr. Rolf Landua, a CERN
physicist and Athena member. "It opens up a whole new line of experiments with
antimatter."

In publishing its paper, Athena appears to have just beaten a consortium, also based at
CERN and known as Atrap, which has also been in the forefront of antimatter research. In
an e-mail message, Atrap's leader, Dr. Gerald Gabrielse of Harvard, called the production
of antihydrogen an "important and challenging" milestone, adding that his group had seen
similar signals.

Dr. Alan Kostelecky, a theoretical physicist at Indiana University, called it "a
phenomenal technical achievement," and said that Athena and Atrap were the "the Wright
Brothers of antimatter physics." Dr. Kostelecky compared today's announcement to the
first powered flight: "Who knows where it will lead. Nobody can foresee it."

In science fiction, antimatter, with its perfect convertibility to energy, is the
ultimate rocket fuel, but the CERN scientists see their antihydrogen atoms as a ticket
not across the galaxy but in effect to a different mathematical universe, in which
positive is negative and left is right.

According to the standard theories of physics, the antimatter universe should look
identical to our own. Antihydrogen and hydrogen atoms should have the same properties,
emitting the exact same frequencies of light, for example.

But some theorists have speculated that the symmetry between matter and antimatter might
be violated in some versions of theories that seek to unite Einstein's theories on
gravity with the weird rules of quantum mechanics. The most ambitious such "theory of
everything," which portrays particles as strings wriggling in 10-dimensional space-time,
seems to preserve the matter-antimatter symmetry, but theorists do not really understand
why.

Antimatter has been part of physics since 1927 when its existence was predicted by the
British physicist Paul Dirac. The antielectron, or positron, was discovered in 1932.
According to the theory, matter can only be created in particle-antiparticle pairs. It is
still a mystery, cosmologists say, why the universe seems to be overwhelmingly composed
of normal matter.

In modern laboratories like CERN or Fermilab in Illinois, physicists accelerate
antiprotons or positrons produced by nuclear reactions to the speed of light and collide
them with conventional particles to produce tiny starbursts of primordial energy,
recreating forms of matter and energy unseen since the big bang.

The raw material for CERN's antimatter factories is made by shooting protons, or naked
hydrogen nuclei, into a iridium target, but "instead of speeding them up," Dr. Landua
said, "we slow them down."

To do that, CERN built the Antiproton Decelerator, which uses electric and magnetic
fields to slow the particles from near light speed to about one-tenth of that, he said.

From there the antiprotons go into a "catching trap," where most of their remaining
energy is absorbed and radiated away by electrons swirling in a magnetic field, lowering
them to a temperature of about 15 degrees above absolute zero and speeds of a few hundred
feet per second. Meanwhile, positrons from the decay of a form of radioactive sodium are
separately slowed and accumulated. The two clouds of oppositely charged particles are
then superimposed by adjusting electrical fields in a cylindrical "mixing trap" lined
with detectors.

Once an antiproton and positron have joined forces, the resulting antihydrogen atom is
electrically neutral and thus no longer caged by the electrical fields in the trap. "The
atom drifts to where it wants to go," said Dr. Landua, namely the wall where its
components will annihilate with their opposite numbers in a characteristic pattern: the
antiproton into a spray of lighter particles called pions, and the positron producing a
flash of gamma rays. The Athena team recorded this pattern 131 times and based on
simulations, concluded that it had produced at least 50,000 antihydrogen atoms.

The Athena experimenters say they still know very little about their antihydrogen atoms.
They say that in the spring, they hope to train a laser on the antihydrogen to make a
preliminary measurement of the atom's spectrum so that it can be compared to regular
hydrogen.

"Any measurement would be interesting because we know essentially nothing about it," Dr.
Hangst said

Biggest Environmental Cleanup Project Begins at Nuclear Site
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

RICHLAND, Wash., Sept. 18 -  After a decade of fits and starts, construction has begun on
a $4 billion waste treatment complex at the Hanford nuclear reservation, the biggest
environmental cleanup project in the country.

Environmental advocates say the timing is none too soon. At least 67 of Hanford's 177
underground tanks, some of them decrepit and well beyond their intended service lives,
have leaked more than one million gallons of radioactive brew into the soil.

The waste has contaminated the aquifer, and the tanks are just seven miles from the
Columbia River, which borders Hanford.

"There's a lot at stake," said John Britton, a spokesman for Bechtel National, which was
hired to rescue the stranded project last year after the previous contractor's cost
estimates doubled to $15.2 billion.

State regulators have squabbled with the Energy Department over the project since the
early 1990's, when the department scuttled a plan to turn some waste into grout and bury
it in sealed containers.

The new plant will turn radioactive waste from plutonium production into more manageable
glass cylinders. The process, called vitrification, mixes radioactive waste with
glass-forming materials and melts them at 2,000 degrees to make a molten glass that is
poured into canisters for long-term storage.

The most-radioactive glass will go to a national repository, probably Yucca Mountain in
Nevada, where it will take 10,000 years to decay. The less-radioactive waste will be
buried in trenches in the 560-square-mile Hanford reservation.

Exactly how much of the nearly 54 million gallons of radioactive waste will be turned
into glass is still being debated within the Energy Department. The Bush administration
wants the agency to study cheaper ways to treat low-activity radioactive waste.

For now, the focus is on building the plant. In 2005, the plant should be ready for
nonradioactive testing; "hot" testing is scheduled to begin in 2007.

Crews at a test site will use simulated waste to find the best way to remove the
radioactive mix of liquid, salt cake and sludge from the tanks.

Plutonium was made at the Hanford site for more than 40 years for the nation's nuclear
arsenal, including the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in World War II.

NUCLEONICS WEEK - September 19, 2002 
Davis-Besse Set To Restart Dec. 4, But NRC Approval A Question Mark
-Daniel Horner, Washington

FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (Fenoc) this week presented a schedule
for restart of Davis-Besse, saying its target date was Dec. 4. Full-power
operation would follow three days later, the company said. Other key dates
in the schedule were Oct. 30 for completion of the core reload and Nov. 18
for NRC restart approval. As it has throughout the process, NRC refrained
from endorsing the Fenoc projection. Fenoc officials released the
information at a Sept. 17 meeting in Oak Harbor, Ohio of the special NRC
oversight panel formed under Inspection Manual Chapter 0350 to coordinate
the regulatory aspects of the Davis-Besse restart effort. Severe
degradation of the Davis-Besse reactor head was discovered in March during
a refueling outage.

The second report said the Davis-Besse vessel liner, or cladding, was
thinner than originally thought and also had a crack-actually a series of
small cracks, spanning about 3/8 inch. That information came from analysis
of a 17-inch-diameter specimen of the degraded reactor head. Fenoc
submitted both reports to NRC earlier this month.

The second report, dated Sept. 9, said the average thickness of the
stainless steel liner was 0.256 inches, with a minimum of 0.202 in. That
is considerably less than the "nominal" 3/8 (0.375)-in. thickness of the
liner but still somewhat above the design minimum of 3/16 (0.188) in. The
liner was all that remained of the reactor coolant system pressure
boundary after boric acid corroded a 6.5-in.-deep hole in the carbon-steel
Davis-Besse head. According to an NRC preliminary notification, "The depth
of the crack is not known, but there are no indications that it is through
the wall of the liner."

Carlsbad's WIPP on list to build nuclear triggers

CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -  An underground repository that drew intense
opposition for storing low- to mid-level radioactive trash is one of
five sites that may start making plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons.

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, which has accepted only such secondary
waste as glove boxes or contaminated clothing since 1999, could be
transformed into a $4 billion facility to manufacture plutonium pits,
the core that triggers a nuclear weapon.

Besides WIPP, possible trigger makers include Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, the Nevada Test Site and
the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, Sen. Pete Domenici said
Thursday.

About 1,500 people would be employed at the plant, which the Energy
Department hopes to have running by 2020.

"It would be a tremendous asset to the city," Carlsbad Mayor Bob
Forrest said.

The trigger plant would help put the site to good use once waste
shipments are done, he said.

"We'll use the same philosophy we did with WIPP: It's got to be safe,"
Forrest said.

A public meeting on the proposal is scheduled 7-10 p.m. Oct. 10 at the
Skeen-Whitlock Building. A separate meeting will be set for Los Alamos
on Oct. 24.

Carlsbad was originally one of 12 sites being considered, Forrest said.

State Rep. John Heaton, D-Carlsbad, said getting the facility in
Carlsbad was a real possibility. He said Carlsbad was viable because
pit production could be kept separate from other aspects of weapons
production conducted at places like LANL and Pantex, yet Carlsbad is
still conveniently close to those sites.

"We are very early in the process," Domenici said, "but I am glad that
the NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration) is taking a good
look at Eddy County."

Taxpayers to Owe Billions for Nuclear Waste Storage
September 26, 2002
The New York Times

By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 ÷ A federal appeals court has ruled that billions
of dollars in damages that the Energy Department is likely to owe to
nuclear reactor owners for its failure to store nuclear waste will have
to come from taxpayers, not electricity consumers.

The Energy Department signed contracts with reactor owners in the early
1980's promising to accept their wastes for burial beginning in January
1998, in exchange for payments from them based on electricity
production. To date, reactor owners have paid more than $10.5 billion.

But now the department says it cannot take waste until 2010, and the
operators of the reactors are suing because they have been forced to
store the waste on site.

Many experts say the storage cannot start for many years, because of
uncertainties about Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the
government has chosen as its waste repository.

Estimates of the damages run from $2 billion to $60 billion, and the
decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit,
in Atlanta, twice used the word "nebulous" to describe them. At the
National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which is made
up of state officials, Brian J. O'Connell, the director of the Nuclear
Waste Program office, said the number would run "in the billions." Asked
if it would reach tens of billions, Mr. O'Connell, said, "It gets
fuzzy."

He said that one utility, Northern States Power of Minnesota, put its
costs at $1 billion because it might be forced to shut three reactors
prematurely, for want of storage space for the radioactive waste.

The only settlement so far is much smaller. The department and the
owners of the three-reactor Peach Bottom plant, in the Pennsylvania town
of the same name, agreed on $80 million, to pay extra costs for storing
the wastes on site, in giant steel and concrete casks. But 13 other
reactor owners sued to block the deal, because the money would have come
from the Nuclear Waste Fund, money from power customers that they said
was supposed to be used only to open a permanent repository.

In a decision dated Sept. 24, the appeals court ruled that money in the
fund can only be used for permanent disposal. The court said that the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the law that allowed the contracts, called for
a quid pro quo "in which each utility roughly pays the costs of
disposing of its waste and no more." The plan, the court said was for a
system in which the burden of the government's breach of contract would
"fall on the government, not other utilities."

A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Jay E. Silberg, said that if the Energy
Department could use the money collected from utilities to pay damages
to the utilities, the department would be "robbing Peter to pay Peter."

"The lesson learned from the court's ruling is that we need to move
forward with the Yucca Mountain Project," said Joseph H. Davis, a
spokesman for the Department of Energy.

At the Regulatory Utility Commissioners group, Mr. O'Connell said the
decision was a victory because "ratepayers had some assurance that the
nuclear waste fund would continue to be used for its intended purpose."
But he acknowledged that if the burden shifted to taxpayers, it would be
paid by most of the same people. "There's about an 80 percent
convergence," he said.

'88 Warning Was Rejected at Damaged Nuclear Plant
September 30, 2002
By MATTHEW L. WALD 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 - The discovery in February that a
reactor vessel in a nuclear power plant had corroded to the
brink of rupturing may have shocked the plant's operators
and federal safety regulators, but years ago, Howard C.
Whitcomb saw it coming, or something like it. 

Mr. Whitcomb, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission
inspector who was hired by the owners of the Davis-Besse
reactor, near Toledo, Ohio, to write a report on what was
wrong with maintenance there, concluded in 1988 that
management so disdained its craft workers that it had lost
touch with the condition of the plant. 

Top executives responded swiftly and decisively, he said:
They ordered him to change his report. He quit instead. 

Now, the owners are saying they need to get in better touch
with their employees, who according to company surveys are
still reluctant to raise safety concerns. In a meeting with
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in mid-September, company
officials explained that they were meeting with all 800
plant employees in small groups with a facilitator to
improve communication. The plant, built for Toledo Edison,
is now run by First Energy Nuclear Operating Company, after
a merger. 

The simple problem at Davis-Besse, a 24-year-old reactor,
was that water was leaking from two nozzles on top of the
vessel. The water contained boron, a chemical used to
regulate the nuclear reaction, and the boron accumulated in
a hidden spot and ate away about 70 pounds of steel. 

The commission staff has said that the company's reports on
the condition of the vessel head were misleading. 

Now the reactor head must be replaced, a task that has
required cutting a big hole through a containment dome
several feet thick. 

But there are broader questions. Why did the company delay
making a change to the reactor head that would have made
inspection possible? Why did not the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which wanted all plants of Davis-Besse's type
to inspect for the problem, push for earlier action? 

As is common after severe problems at a reactor, the
commission has been examining the structure of management
and what it calls the plant's culture, meaning the
attitudes of the people who work there, the willingness of
operators to raise safety questions and management's
willingness to consider them. 

While the corrosion at the vessel head was not obvious, the
boron had spread elsewhere, and the commission is
particularly interested in why no one did anything about
corrosion on a ventilation duct that was in plain sight of
workers entering the containment. 

"People generally accepted that condition," said Todd M.
Schneider, a spokesman for First Energy. Since the
discovery of the corrosion in the vessel head, management
has worked to change attitudes so "those conditions are no
longer acceptable," Mr. Schneider said. 

In his 1988 report, Mr. Whitcomb mentioned the culture
problems that are now recognized. 

"Many craft personnel hold strong negative perceptions of
engineering and management personnel," he wrote. "In
general, the labor forces feel that management exhibits a
general lack of concern or respect for their abilities,
efforts or problems." 

Mr. Whitcomb was hardly an industry rebel. A veteran of the
nuclear Navy, he was a resident inspector for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission at the H.B. Robinson reactor in South
Carolina, and then went to a plant under construction in
Ohio before being hired by Toledo Edison. After he gave two
weeks' notice at Davis-Besse, he went to work at the Fermi
reactor, near Detroit. Now he is a lawyer in general
practice in Oak Harbor, Ohio, the location of the
Davis-Besse reactor. 

In a report on June 20, 1988, to the company's vice
president for nuclear power and the plant manager, he said
that closing to refuel took too long; that preventive
maintenance was slow and not fully effective because
managers did not pay enough attention to the workers'
needs; and that the workers were embittered. 

"Maintenance has traditionally been regarded in a
subservient role at Davis-Besse," Mr. Whitcomb wrote. To be
successful, management must recognize "the contribution
that craft personnel may provide in the development of
plant-specific maintenance actions." Managers must take a
more serious attitude toward maintenance, he wrote. 

That finding in the report, a copy of which was provided to
The New York Times by Ohio Citizen Action, a nonprofit
group that has raised many safety questions about the
reactor, seems prescient. 

"If they followed the advice of 20 years ago, we wouldn't
be here now," said Amy K. Ryder, the group's program
director in the Cleveland area. 

In an interview, Mr. Whitcomb said, "They just didn't want
to hear it." 

Mr. Schneider, the spokesman for First Energy, said that
the two executives to whom Mr. Whitcomb had made his report
14 years ago were no longer with the company. The report
"was not up to our requirements," he said, but he would not
confirm that Mr. Whitcomb had been told to rewrite it. Mr.
Whitcomb left Toledo Edison voluntarily, he said. 

The company says it hopes to restart the plant this year.
Work is progressing well on the head replacement, Mr.
Schneider said. First Energy bought the head of a similar
reactor in Michigan on which construction has been
abandoned. It is still working on the culture, he said.

Nuke Waste Suit Ruling Against Nebraska

Judge Says State Acted In Bad Faith

POSTED: 11:13 a.m. CDT September 30, 2002
LINCOLN, Neb. -- A federal judge ruled today that Nebraska officials
intentionally tried to kill plans to build a regional dump for low-level
radioactive waste in the state.

The dump was meant to hold low-level radioactive waste from Oklahoma, Nebraska,
Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana.

U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf said the administration of former Nebraska
Gov. Ben Nelson, who is now a U.S. senator, acted in bad faith in refusing to
license the dump.  Kopf ordered Nebraska to pay $151 million, but the decision 
is expected to be appealed.

Utilities that generate radioactive waste sued Nebraska, accusing state
officials of acting in bad faith by not licensing the dump in 1998. The other 
states in the waste compact, including Oklahoma, later joined the lawsuit.

CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -  A state representative says the political atmosphere will
be the single most important issue in deciding whether the Carlsbad area beats
four other contenders for a plant to produce the triggers of nuclear weapons.

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad; Los Alamos National Laboratory
in northern New Mexico; the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas; the Nevada Test
Site; and South Carolina's Savannah River Site are being considered for a $4.1
billion factory for nuclear weapons cores, called plutonium pits. The plant,
which the U.S. Department of Energy hopes to open by 2020, would employ about
1,000.

"The single most important issue will be the political one," Rep. John Heaton,
D-Carlsbad, said during a public hearing on the project Tuesday. "I think
Carlsbad is a place willing to do it and has done it (with WIPP)."  WIPP, an 
underground repository for plutonium-contaminated waste from defense
work, opened in March 1999.

Heaton encouraged area residents to support the plutonium pit factory at a DOE
meeting next week.  But some among the approximately 50 people who attended 
Tuesday's meeting said they were worried that a plutonium factory might hurt 
other industries coming to town.

And a retired minister, Gene Harbaugh, said he opposed any plan that would
bring a plutonium facility to Carlsbad.  Harbaugh also said the WIPP project
and the pit facility are as "different as night and day." "This is a completely
different animal and should be regarded as such," he said.

U.S. pit production operations shut down in 1989 at DOE's Rocky Flats facility
near Denver, and no pits have been made since. Los Alamos is developing an
interim facility that could make as many as 50 pits a year by 2007.

Resident Ford Stone questioned how plutonium would be shipped and the
"terrorist proof"-nature of the project.

Roger Nelson, chief scientist at the DOE's Carlsbad Field Office, said he
couldn't say if the project would be terrorist-proof. Specific information about 
plutonium shipments is classified, he said.  Nelson directed specific questions 
to DOE National Nuclear Security Administration representatives who will 
visit Carlsbad next week.  He said, however, waste created by the production 
facility could be buried in WIPP.

'The single most important issue will be the political one.' 
-Rep. John Heaton, NM legislator

Carlsbad leaders said the plant would bring construction jobs and permanent
jobs. Mayor Bob Forrest also said it would help bring more amenities to town,
such as national restaurant chains.

"I'll back it if it proves to be worthwhile for our community," said audience
member Christa Wolven.

OHIO: U.S. CITES VIOLATIONS AT NUCLEAR PLANT 
The government said it had found 10 violations at a nuclear
plant where an acid leak nearly ate through a
six-inch-thick steel reactor cap. The plant's operator, the
FirstEnergy Corporation, failed to correct safety problems
and violated rules for operating the reactor, the report,
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said. The violations
cited included failure to remove large amounts of acid on
the reactor head, which caused nozzles to crack, and
leaving acid deposits on air coolers.

Utah County's Toxic Tradition Is Under Threat 
By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

TOOELE, Utah, Oct. 18 -  As other places in the United States have struggled
to keep dangerous materials away, Tooele County has welcomed some of the
deadliest things ever made: radioactive waste, ammunition, chemical and
biological weapons.

For nearly 60 years, government and private facilities here in the vast
desert west of Salt Lake City have stored and processed hazardous wastes of
all stripes, winning the county a reputation as one of America's foremost
dumping grounds.

But now, even as some lethal substances are being destroyed under terms of
federal mandates and international agreements, efforts to bring new toxic
materials into the county have set off bruising political fights, leading to
an unusual state ballot initiative next month in one case and a plea to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission in another.

Caught in the breach are Tooele County residents who speak proudly of their
toxic traditions and insist that the county and the country have benefited
from stockpiling the material here. Since the first federal installations
opened in the early days of World War II, Tooele County (pronounced
Too-WILL-uh) has tripled in population, reaching almost 41,000 by the last
census.

"We have taken on a huge share of the defense of America," said Gene D.
White, a Tooele County commissioner, referring to nearly a dozen federal and
private operations in the county that deal with things few other places
want. "Instead of getting credit, all we do is get criticized for it."

Tooele County is Utah's second-largest, at 6,930 square miles, about 84
percent of which belongs to the federal and state governments. The gathering
of dangerous material here began shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
when Washington designated 200 square miles of its Tooele land for weapons
testing. Over the next six decades, county residents have lived alongside
Air Force bombing ranges, testing and storage sites for chemical and
biological weapons, mineral processing plants, toxic landfills and large
incinerators now used to destroy stored weapons. Almost half the nation's
supply of chemical weapons is kept at the eastern end of the county.

All the while, the county's largest towns, Tooele and Grantsville, have
become thriving bedroom communities to Salt Lake City, an easy commute 30
miles to the east. The towns have affordable housing, scenic mountains,
quiet neighborhoods, safe distances from bombing runs and storage sites and
no evidence of uncommon health risks.

But now, as the county waits to open its arms again, strong resistance is
building to new toxic imports, although it is far from clear whether the
opposition will actually stop the flow or merely delay it.

The disputes have coalesced around two entities with strong ties to the
county -  Envirocare of Utah, the nation's largest private disposal company
for low-level radioactive waste, and the Skull Valley Goshutes, a small
Indian tribe proposing to build temporary storage for spent nuclear fuels
headed to permanent entombment at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

After a dozen years of processing low-level radioactive waste, like dirt and
rubble from cleanups at former weapons plants, Envirocare won federal and
state permits to take materials with higher levels of radioactivity, like
medical waste. But as the Goshutes' proposal began drawing more controversy,
Envirocare suspended plans to seek final approval from the Legislature and
governor.

"Maybe not forever and all time," said Betty Arial, a spokeswoman for
Envirocare. "But for now, plans are not being discussed."

Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a third-term Republican, applauded Envirocare's
decision to back off, saying he would have denied any permit for
higher-grade imports, but opponents to Envirocare were not taking any
chances. Led by Doug Foxley, a powerful state lobbyist, they collected
enough signatures to get a complex measure before voters, using the promise
of desperately needed new tax money for public education as its strongest
selling point.

If passed, the measure would bar all higher level radioactive materials from
the state and raise taxes fourfold on revenues generated by low-grade
material.

As both sides interpret the measure, it would affect only Envirocare, but
critics say it would require changes to more than 100 state laws, and
"that's not the way to run a democracy," Mr. Leavitt said in an interview
this week. Officials in Tooele also objected on economic grounds, insisting
passage would put Envirocare out of business, costing more than 250 county
residents their jobs and the county a quarter of its annual income, about $5
million.

"This is a scam on state government," said Teryl Hunsaker, another county
commissioner. "It will wind up hurting the state of Utah."

Mr. Foxley said, "That's nonsense and absurd, nothing but a malicious scare
tactic." Insisting that "monopolies like Envirocare" do not go out of
business, he added, "No one in his right mind spends the money to go through
the permitting process, to stop short of going through the legislative
process."

The Goshutes' effort has been no less emotional. With gaming unlawful in
Utah, a band of several dozen Goshutes in Tooele County has turned to
nuclear waste as a potential revenue source. A proposed deal between the
Goshutes and a group of out-of-state utilities that needs to remove 40,000
tons of spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants is now awaiting federal
approval.

The licensing board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to
announce in December if the technical standards for the proposed site have
been met. If so, commission staff members would consider recommending the
project to proceed.

The deal would mean millions of dollars for the Goshutes. But court
challenges are sure to follow any federal approval, and Mr. Leavitt has
vowed to block the plan.

Mr. Leavitt said he was especially concerned about the safety of storing
large quantities of nuclear material in one place, where they might be
vulnerable to terrorist attack. He said he also worries about fighter jets
that train over the area, and the occasional accidents, like cruise missiles
that veer off course, striking unintended targets, as one did recently,
hitting an abandoned trailer.

From the county's perspective, years of partnerships with the federal
government and private disposal companies have brought none of the problems
that opponents say are lurking, including health risks. Sherrie Ahlstrom,
the community health supervisor, said studies by state officials had never
found any links to illness or disease from toxic substances in the county.

Nicole Cline, a county planner who is writing a history of Tooele's
experience with waste, conceded that people often poked fun at Tooele County
as the nation's dumping ground. Her response is always the same, mindful
that every community grapples with toxic waste of some sort.

"I always tell them, `I know where mine is,' " she said. " `Do you know
where yours is?' "

Uranium Plant Enriches Kentucky City, but at the Cost of Health

October 26, 2002
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 

PADUCAH, Ky., Oct. 25 - A half-century ago, Western
Kentucky was so thrilled about the opening of a cold war
uranium enrichment plant that it named a community Cimota -
"atomic" spelled backward. 

Decades later, angry, scared and dying workers file into
the Sick Workers Office in Paducah, pulling oxygen tanks
and fighting incurable tumors. 

As they marked the 50th anniversary this week of the
opening of the enrichment plant, the Paducah Gaseous
Diffusion Plant, residents of this city pondered a mixed
legacy: The plant turned the city into a pocket of wealth
in a poor region, but at a cost. 

Workers were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, and
scores slowly became sick with diseases that the federal
government only recently admitted responsibility for. 

"People come in here very sick," said Stewart Tolar, site
manager at the Energy Employees Compensation Resource
Center. "They feel like they've lost their dignity." 

In 1999, then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson issued an
apology in Paducah after the government reversed decades of
denial and conceded that many workers did get sick because
of exposure to cancer-causing radiation and silica or
beryllium, which can cause lung diseases. 

An entitlement law later provided lifetime medical care and
a tax-free lump sum of $150,000 to those made sick by their
work. 

Since the program began last year, about $62.8 million has
been distributed to former and current workers and their
survivors through the resource office in Paducah, Mr. Tolar
said. 

But recognition came too late for many. One former worker,
Joe Harding, was denied compensation even though his bones
contained 34,000 times the expected concentration of
uranium before he died in 1980. 

In addition to the health disaster, the Energy Department
estimated it would take 10 years and $1.3 billion more than
the $400 million already spent to clean up environmental
contamination. 

Even so, many former workers say that seeing their city get
rich while doing what many considered their patriotic duty
during the cold war, making weapons-grade uranium for
warheads, made it all worthwhile. 

"It's been a good salary and it's got good benefits," said
Rodney Cook 53, a shift superintendent who had part of a
lung removed in March because of exposure to asbestos he
believed he received in his 27 years at the plant. "I don't
blame anybody for it. It was just part of the job." 

With the increase in demand for engineers and scientist at
the plant, the middle and upper classes expanded in what
had primarily been an Ohio River and railroad town. 

To this day, the Paducah plant is Western Kentucky's
biggest private employer - with more than 1,700 workers -
and one of the largest employers in the state. 

After the United States Enrichment Corporation suspended
operations at a sister uranium plant in Piketon, Ohio, last
year, Paducah became the only place in the nation where
uranium is enriched for the commercial nuclear industry. 

The Energy Department initially thought 3,000 to 4,000
people nationwide might be eligible for compensation for
nuclear-weapons-related work during the cold war, but the
accuracy of that estimate is unclear, in part because of
poor record keeping. 

Despite all that, Paducah, population 27,000, is now in a
competition to attract a new uranium enrichment plant using
safer and more efficient centrifuge technology.

Safety Lapse at Ohio Reactor Is Cited as Potential Peril for Others

November 20, 2002
By MATTHEW L. WALD 

WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 - In a confidential report, the nuclear
industry's internal oversight group has warned utilities
that a focus on production over safety had endangered an
Ohio reactor and could be a broader problem around the
nation. 

Corrosion at the Ohio reactor, discovered in March, ate
away 70 pounds of steel and left the reactor vessel
vulnerable to rupturing. But while the physical degradation
of the reactor was unique, the internal report suggested
that the causes might not be. The report, not intended for
distribution outside the nuclear industry, said the the
First Energy Nuclear Operating Company, 

operators of the reactor, Davis-Besse, near Toledo, had
fallen prey to "excessive focus on meeting short-term
production goals" and "a lack of sensitivity to nuclear
safety." 

"The lessons learned from the Davis-Besse event are
universal in nature and should be reviewed by all nuclear
stations," said the report, by the Institute of Nuclear
Power Operations, a group formed by the industry after the
March 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, Pa., to share
expertise and reduce the chance of further meltdowns. The
report is marked "limited distribution" and is coded "Red:
Immediate Attention." 

For several years, outside critics have raised alarms about
a deregulated power market, saying managers would cut
corners to keep reactors operating when they should have
been shut for maintenance. Even the chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission raised that concern, in 1994. 

At Davis-Besse, in Oak Harbor, about 25 miles east of
Toledo, managers postponed taking the time to inspect an
area on the vessel head that turned out to be corroding,
and ignored warning signs that this was happening, the
report said. 

The industry has not publicly admitted to any worry, nor
seized the Davis-Besse incident as a warning. The new
report, however, recommended that each nuclear company
"conduct a self-assessment to determine to what degree your
organization has a healthy respect for nuclear safety and
that nuclear safety is not compromised by production
priorities." 

The institute has a quasiregulatory function, bringing
lagging reactor operators up to the industry standard as a
way to head off tighter rules from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. After the meltdown of the reactor at Three Mile
Island, in March 1979, the industry created the institute
to investigate problems at each plant and to issue
confidential reports to the others, so they all could
benefit from lessons learned. Operators of all the nation's
power reactors are members of the institute, and on the
intermittent occasions when its internal assessments become
public, they have all been written in blunt terms. Industry
executives say its pronouncements are carefully read. 

This one, nine pages plus footnotes, was made available by
a nuclear industry expert who is seeking to have the
industry take it to heart. 

A spokesman for the institute, Terry Young, said its
personnel could get access to the plants, and state their
findings plainly, only if everyone agreed that the findings
should be kept within the industry. "We cherish that sense
of trust," he said. 

Mr. Young said the reports did, in fact, discuss management
issues when that was relevant. 

The report, dated Nov. 11, cites one failing that seems to
show that Davis-Besse's operators had not learned to
benefit from other failures. In a July 2001 report to
members, the institute emphasized the importance of
inspecting for corrosion after a less severe problem was
found at a similar plant in South Carolina, Oconee. The
institute said managers suffered from "isolationism." 

The Oconee report was "reviewed and accepted" by management
at Davis-Besse, the institute said, but managers did not
perform the inspection on their own plant. 

A year ago, even as the steel was being eaten away, the
plant's operator was seeking permission to raise its power
output by 12.9 percent above what it was licensed for when
it opened in 1978. 

Experts not involved in the preparation of the report said
that it touched on a difficult area, determining when
priorities have been put in the wrong order and people's
attitudes have shifted away from safety and toward
production, and that this report differed from most written
by the institute because it focused on upper-level
management. 

"Talking about management is very sensitive for them," said
Andrew C. Kadak, the former president of the Yankee Atomic
Electric Company, an umbrella company for three reactors,
and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. 

At the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group that
is generally critical of the industry, David Lochbaum, a
nuclear expert, said measuring attitudes toward safety was
hard for people in the industry. 

"Most of the nuclear industry's people are engineers," Mr.
Lochbaum said. "They love equations, things they can
measure. But safety culture isn't something you can do that
on; you can't see how many feet of safety culture you have
and whether you've come up shy or not." 

Paul Blanch, a nuclear safety consultant, said that for
"merchant" plants, the ones selling their production in
deregulated markets, "their only concern is making money." 

Mr. Blanch said the institute's report "hit the nail on
the head." 

"Production does come before safety," he said. "They've got
to strike the proper balance." 

An engineer at a nuclear plant that was shut for safety
reasons for a time in the 1990's, who would not allow his
name to be used, said the report was a shift for the
institute, which began by trying to share best practices
around the industry, and later on human performance, but
which is now focused on leadership performance.

BRITAIN: UTILITY RECEIVES AID Britain extended an emergency loan yesterday for
British Energy, a nuclear power company, and agreed on a restructuring plan
that makes taxpayers liable for nuclear cleanup costs of several billion
pounds. The company will receive £150 million to £200 million a year ($232
million to $309 million) for the next 10 years. In exchange, British Energy
must pay £20 million ($30.9 million) a year plus 65 percent of available cash
toward those liabilities, estimated by the company at £5.2 billion ($8
billion). A new state-backed body called the Nuclear Liability Fund will manage
the cleanup. British Energy ran into trouble this summer after wholesale power
prices tumbled below its production costs. It has been surviving on government
assistance since September.  (Reuters)

U.S. National - AP Leak Prompted Texas Reactor Shutdown 
Tue Dec 3, 4:27 PM ET
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer

DALLAS (AP) - A reactor at a Texas nuclear power plant was shut down after a
leak of radioactive water, leading to government scrutiny of the utility's plan
for finding such leaks.

Operators shut down the TXU Energy's Comanche Peak twin-reactor plant well
before leakage exceeded federal guidelines, TXU spokesman David Beshear said
Tuesday. They have since repaired leaking and corroded lines.

"There was never a danger to the safety of the plant, the safety of the
employees or the safety of the public," he said. Comanche Peak is about 80
miles southwest of Dallas.

A report by Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors said radiation monitors
inside the plant's Unit 1 sounded alarms after recording high radiation
readings on Sept. 26.

Radiation levels peaked six more times before operators shut down the reactor
two days later, the inspectors said.

The leak was found in a small tube carrying radioactive water in one of four
generators that make steam to turn the reactor's electric turbines.

The utility's own report to the NRC said a subsequent TXU check found corrosion
in 667 other tubes in Unit 1, but none was leaking. That number, according to
TXU, represented more than 3 percent of the tubes.

NRC spokesman Roger Hannah said an inspection of the plant focused on Comanche
Peak's system for finding and responding to leaks.

"What we're interested in is whether they should have picked up on this
earlier," he said.

The utility said it was the first unplanned shutdown of the plant, which
returned to service Nov. 11.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, said the leak could have quickly developed from debris in the water
or over time if corrosion had been overlooked.

"If it was missed and they had the opportunity to prevent this in the past and
missed it, that's one thing," he said. "But if it happened randomly, then there
was nothing they could do to prevent this."

Lochbaum said similar leaks have shut down about a dozen plants in the past
decade.

The Davis-Besse nuclear power plant near Toledo, Ohio, has been shut down since
February because an accumulation of acid nearly ate through a 6-inch-thick
steel reactor cap. That leak, discovered in March, was the most extensive
corrosion ever found on a U.S. nuclear reactor and led to a nationwide review
of 69 similar plants.

Comanche Peak nuclear plant still down
Associated Press

GLEN ROSE - The public was never in danger after a leak at a North Texas
nuclear reactor, and plant officials followed the proper procedures in shutting
down the device, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission official said today.

A reactor at TXU's Comanche Peak Steam Electric Plant was shut down in
September after leaking low-level radioactive water, which did not escape from
a protective containment area, officials said Tuesday.

"In response to the indications they had, they took very good and appropriate
action," said Dwight Chamberlain, director of the division of reactor safety at
the NRC's Arlington office.

The reactor was shut down when the water was leaking at a rate of about half a
cup a minute. The plant's requirement for shutting down is a leak of 1 cup a
minute; the NRC requires action at 2 cups a minute, TXU officials said.

NRC officials on Tuesday presented a report from a special inspection team,
which found that three incidents of human error led to the steam generator tube
leak. The plant is unlikely to be fined or otherwise penalized, Chamberlain
said.

In two of the mistakes, TXU made the necessary corrections. The NRC still is
examining the third incident, in which a plant employee reviewing computer data
failed to report a marginal problem that later led to the leak, TXU officials
said.

"We've already retrained all of our analysts for looking at this data," said
Lance Terry, a TXU senior vice president and principal nuclear officer. "You
take a lesson learned and you retrain people."

Comanche Peak, near Glen Rose, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, went
online in 1990 with one reactor. It now has two.

The reactor was shut down to repair more than 660 corroded and cracked tubes
and for refueling. It remains out of service for unrelated problems despite two
attempts over the past month to get it running again.

Terry said the reactor could be operating again by later this week.

The troubled reactor resumed operation Nov. 15 but was shut down Nov. 23
because of a potential valve problem, TXU officials said. The reactor was back
in service two days later. But on Nov. 30, a blown fuse triggered a safety
mechanism that caused a control rod to drop into the reactor's core, TXU
spokesman David Beshear said.

The control rod is a safety measure that slows the nuclear reaction in the
core.

On Dec. 3, the reactor was taken off-line again, this time to repair an
electric coil. Plant workers found that the coil failure was caused by a leaky
weld in a canopy seal at the control rod, Beshear said.

He said that the weld has been repaired and that other minor work is being
done.

Bill Johnson, NRC branch chief responsible for overseeing reactor inspections
at Comanche Peak and two other nuclear plants, said such leaks are not uncommon
at the canopy seal by the control rod.

decide within 30 days whether to cite a TXU Corp. TXU.N unit for an
apparent safety violation at a Texas nuclear power unit, the agency and TXU
said Wednesday.

The apparent violation involves a leaking steam generator tube at the 1,150
megawatt Comanche Peak 1 plant in Glen Rose, Texas.

The unit is currently shut for electrical work following a refueling and
repair outage to fix the leak, and is expected to return to service within
a few days.

On Tuesday, the NRC presented their preliminary results of a special
inspection done after the leak, NRC public affairs officer Roger Hannah
told Reuters.

"We came to the conclusion that in three instances there were indications
during previous testing that were missed by the analyst looking at this
particular problem. In one case, the one that lead to the leak, there was
an apparent violation," Hannah said, adding that in the other two cases,
there were no violations.

"We're still doing the risk analysis and we won't know for sure what our
actions will be as an agency until we complete that risk analysis," he
added.

"The bottom line is, from a safety standpoint, (TXU) took conservative
action and shut the plant down when they saw this small leak. There was no
detectable radiation released in the environment," Hannah said.

The NRC also said it had not classified its preliminary finding into one of
its four-color codes for safety violations.

The findings range in severity from green to white, yellow or red for the
most serious violations.

In a pressurized water reactor, like the Comanche Peak unit, steam
generators are used to heat water into steam which is then used to turn
turbine-generators and make electricity.

The steam generators contain thousands of tubes which circulate heated
water from the reactor vessel. The water from the reactor contains some
radioactivity and a leak or rupture in a tube allows leakage from the
reactor, or primary side, to the turbine-generator, or secondary side, of
the plant.

The unit was taken out of service for its scheduled autumn refueling a few
days early to fix the tube leak.

TXU Energy spokesman David Beshear said in response to the findings the
company has already retrained their analysts to look for this particular
kind of problem.

"The (levels) were well below the computer model threshold and the human
threshold, but yes, we think the analyst should have caught the problem
also," Beshear said.

The reactor vessel heads at the plant have also been inspected and no
problems were found, Beshear said previously, adding there was no plans to
replace the heads.

Recently, reactor vessel heads at pressurized water reactors have come
under scrutiny after severe corrosion was discovered earlier this year at
FirstEnergy's FE.N Davis Besse nuclear power plant in Ohio.

The Comanche Peak station also consists of the adjacent 1,150 MW Unit 2,
which continued to run at full power on Wednesday, the NRC said in its
reactor status report.

Problems keep reactor at nuclear power plant closed

FORT WORTH (AP) -  A reactor at a nuclear power plant that was shut down after leaking
radioactive water is still out of service despite two attempts over the past month to
get it running again.

The reactor at the Comanche Peak plant was shut down in September to repair more than
660 corroded and cracked tubes and for refueling.

"The reactor should be back in operation in a number of days," said TXU spokesman
David Beshear. "The bottom line is safety, and we have systems in place that work
correctly."

TXU is scheduled to meet Tuesday at the plant with a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
special inspection team that has investigated problems with the steam-generating
tubes.

"This will be a discussion of the team's preliminary findings and a look at what the
company has been doing to address the problem," said Ken Clark, NRC spokesman.

Comanche Peak, near Glen Rose, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, went online in
1990 with one reactor. It now has two.

The troubled reactor resumed operation Nov. 15 but was shut down Nov. 23 because of a
potential valve problem, TXU officials said. The reactor was back in service two days
later. But on Nov. 30, a blown fuse triggered a safety mechanism that caused a control
rod to drop into the reactor's core, Beshear said.

The control rod is a safety measure that slows the nuclear reaction in the core.

On Dec. 3, the reactor was taken off-line again, this time to repair an electric coil.
Plant workers found that the coil failure was caused by a leaky weld in a canopy seal
at the control rod, Beshear said.

He said that the weld has been repaired and that other minor work is being done.

Bill Johnson, NRC branch chief responsible for overseeing reactor inspections at
Comanche Peak and two other nuclear plants, said "such leaks are not uncommon" at the
canopy seal by the control rod.

"It's not a major safety problem," Johnson said. "It's an operating problem."

None of the problems has posed a safety or public health risk, TXU and NRC officials
said, but the September incident prompted government scrutiny of the utility's plan
for finding such leaks.

Officials: Water leak at Comanche Peak nuke plant was missed
Regulators' decision pending on whether to cite TXU for violation
12/11/2002
By RANDY LEE LOFTIS / The Dallas Morning News

GLEN ROSE, Texas - Corrosion that caused a small radioactive-water leak at the
Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in late September should have been noticed
and repaired as early as April 2001, federal regulators and TXU executives said
Tuesday.

The leak, which was stopped within a few days, did not release radiation into
the environment or pose a risk to the public, government officials said at a
meeting at the plant, about 75 miles southwest of Dallas.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials said the failure to note a "clearly
identifiable" flaw in a steam-generator tube could result in a violation notice
for the Dallas-based utility, though no decision has been made. Officials said
two other errors made when the leak was found were minor and would not result
in violation notices.

"We feel like Comanche Peak took appropriate and conservative action in
response to the tube leak," said Dwight Chamberlain, reactor safety director
for the NRC's Arlington regional office.

James Kelley, a TXU vice president, said the company agrees with an NRC finding
that tests during a routine shutdown in April 2001 showed problems with the
tube that later leaked.

"That crack that we missed ... caused this small, minor leak," he said.

Plant officials were not required to shut down the two-reactor plant's Unit 1
after finding the leak Sept. 26 but chose to do so Sept. 28. The reactor was
scheduled for a refueling shutdown and equipment inspection starting the next
week.

That work and the leak repair are done, but the reactor was still shut down
Tuesday because of separate equipment problems.

The leak was the first since Comanche Peak's Unit 1 reactor started full-power
operations in 1990. However, the utility has plugged hundreds of
steam-generator tubes to take them out of service after signs of corrosion were
found.

In each of the two units, more than 18,000 tubes carry radioactive,
reactor-heated water through steam generators that make steam to turn power
plant turbines. If too many tubes are taken out of service, the plant's
productivity drops.

Mr. Kelley said an economic analysis would show whether TXU should keep
repairing damaged tubes or replace all four of Unit 1's steam generators.
Replacements would cost a total of $150 million, he said.

The Unit 2 equipment, which is several years younger and has improved corrosion
resistance, is not being considered for replacement, he said.

Corrosion of steam generator tubes at plants with Westinghouse-built reactors
has been a nuclear industry concern for years. Mr. Kelley said the analysts who
made the errors worked for a Westinghouse contractor.

The analysts, who run tests on equipment and then examine the results looking
for problems, have been retrained, Mr. Kelley said.

================

From the NRC

ONE:
A failure to identify and correct a clearly detectable steam generator tube flaw indication
during eddy current examinations in the 2001 refueling outage (1RF08) resulted in the tube
remaining in service until it leaked in September of 2002.

TWO:
Inspectors identified a non-cited violation of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B,
Criterion XVI for two examples of failure to perform adequate steam generator eddy-current
examination in the 2002 refueling outage (1RF09). The inadequate examinations resulted in
analyst failure to properly characterize two steam generator tube flaws until the licensee took
corrective actions in response to questions from the NRC inspectors.
This finding is greater than minor because it degraded the ability to meet the cornerstone
objective of reactor coolant system pressure boundary. The failure to identify the flaws could
have resulted in flawed tubes that might have developed leaks if left in service. The
significance of this finding is very low because the in situ tests demonstrated that the tubes
would have met the design basis requirements for withstanding analyzed transients, and prior
to returning the plant to operation the licensee removed the flawed tubes from service
(Section 02.02).


The general root causes of stress corrosion cracking are well documented in
industry literature and include having a material that is susceptible to stress
corrosion cracking, the presence of stress in the material, and an aggressive
environment. Each of these causal factors are known to be present for all PWR
steam generators, particularly those employing Inconel Alloy 600 mill-annealed
tubing as is the case for Comanche Peak Unit 1. The aggressiveness of the
cracking, in terms of time to crack initiation and crack growth rate, can be
aggravated by the presence of residual stress or off-normal stress associated
with dings, dents and scratches, material micro-structure, and secondary water
chemistry.

Public Citizen Statement on USEC Plan to Test New Uranium Enrichment
Technology

December 9, 2002

The recent announcement by USEC, Inc. that it has designated its
Portsmouth plant in Piketon, Ohio, as the site of a test facility for a
new kind of uranium enrichment plant has concerning public health,
safety and economic implications. The pilot facility would test
centrifuge technology, for eventual use at a full-scale facility. USEC
plans to submit an application for the test plant to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission next year and begin operations by 2005.  Enriched
uranium is used as fuel in U.S. nuclear power reactors.

The Portsmouth plant has not been enriching uranium since May 2001. 
USEC currently runs the country's only uranium enrichment facility in
Paducah, Kentucky, using gaseous diffusion technology.

Separately, a multinational consortium called Louisiana Energy Services
(LES) is making an effort to build a centrifuge plant in Hartsville,
Tennessee, where it has been met with significant opposition from public
interest and environmental groups.

Uranium enrichment facilities produce massive amounts of long-lived
radioactive and hazardous waste in the form of depleted uranium (DU). 
700,000 metric tons of DU have been amassed in the U.S. during the past
half-century, which now sit in some 50,000 steel cylinders that are
stacked in huge piles on site at the country's old uranium enrichment
facilities, including Portsmouth, where there is a great potential for
leaks that could allow this dangerous radioactive waste to enter into
the environment.  Resuming enrichment operations at Portsmouth would
compound this nuclear waste problem.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has stated concern for the
health and safety of citizens near Portsmouth, noting that the
Department of Energy (DOE) neglected to perform a baseline environmental
assessment report and a screening-level human risk assessment.  Indeed,
USEC has an extremely tainted history of environmental negligence and
what amounts to employee abuse,  which has the government paying out
millions of dollars to retired nuclear industry workers who are now
suffering the health consequences of their tenure working with
radioactive and hazardous materials.

USEC has also been plagued with serious financial problems since it was
privatized by the U.S. government in the late 1990s, calling into
question the financial viability of the centrifuge project. John
Longenecker, a former DOE secretary of enrichment who now consults for
the nuclear industry, indicated that there is a good chance that USEC
will not find financial backing for its new plant, and will require
taxpayer subsidies.  The Washington Post reported that Ohio's
Republican Governor Bob Taft has already "awarded an undisclosed
package of incentives to USEC to nail down the project."

The USEC project fuels the Bush Administration's misguided program
for expanding nuclear power production.  Given the near-catastrophic
maintenance failure at the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant near Toledo,
residents of Ohio should be skeptical of this agenda. In the current
climate, where nuclear power's inherent dangers and security
vulnerabilities have come to the fore, it is irresponsible to construct
new plants to provide fuel for more nuclear reactors.  Sensible energy
policies should instead promote conservation, efficiency, and renewable
source alternatives that will lead us on the path to a sustainable
energy future.

BRITAIN: LOSS AT POWER CONCERN British Energy, a nuclear power generator that
has been struggling to revamp its business, said half-year losses widened
tenfold compared with the period a year ago. British Energy lost £403 million
($637 million) in the six months to Sept. 30, compared with a loss of £37
million last year. British Energy also said it would probably further write
down the value of its eight nuclear plants and one coal-fired plant in Britain.
The company received a bailout from the government in September, when it was
granted £650 million in new credit lines, and is currently pushing through a
revamping plan that would replace £1.26 billion of existing debt with newly
issued bonds and shares.   Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

UTAH: NUCLEAR STORAGE MOVES FORWARD The state was set back in its efforts to
block construction of a nuclear storage site on an Indian reservation near Salt
Lake City when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it did not have to
consider the environmental impact of a terrorist strike on the site. The ruling
allows the Skull Valley Goshutes, a small tribe, to continue plans to bring
40,000 tons of nuclear waste to the area for storage until a permanent site in
Yucca Mountain, Nev., opens, perhaps in 2010. State officials have not decided
on an appeal. Michael Janofsky (NYT)

Nuclear reactors able to withstand attack by airliner

     ASSOCIATED PRESS

Tests using engineering models support the nuclear industry's arguments
that a reactor could withstand a direct hit by a jetliner, an
industry-sponsored report says.

While the tests by engineers independent of the industry provide
valuable data, federal regulators briefed on the findings say they are
waiting for completion of their own tests before drawing conclusions.

The vulnerability of the 4-foot-thick concrete containment domes of
reactors to an airborne strike has been of major concern since the
September 11 attacks.

Reactors are designed to withstand many natural disasters, including
hurricanes and earthquakes. They never were designed specifically to be
protected against a direct hit by a large aircraft such as the planes
flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center.

Findings to be released this week conclude that if a Boeing 767-400
jetliner, fully loaded with 28,980 gallons of fuel, were flown directly
into the center of a reactor at 350 mph, the plane would not penetrate
the structure.

"The analysis indicates that no part of the engine, the fuselage or the
wings -  nor the jet fuel -  entered the containment building," says the
report prepared by two consulting firms for the Electric Power Research
Institute at the request of the nuclear industry.

The computer analysis evaluated a direct impact on the containment
structure of one of the plane's engines and "the global impact" of the
entire aircraft mass on the structure.

The analysis concluded that damage would be limited to "some
sprawling," or crushing of material, of the concrete but with minimal
penetration.

A summary of the report, provided to the Associated Press yesterday by
industry sources, produced no detailed test calculations but said
conservative assumptions were used.

For example, the computer runs assumed a fuel-loaded aircraft, making a
direct hit at the center of the containment building where impact
forces would be greatest.

It assumes use of a Boeing 767-400 because that wide-bodied jet best
represents the commercial aircraft fleets, and the report used a speed
of 350 mph because that is believed to be the speed at which two
jetliners hit their targets on September 11.

Higher speeds would make an aircraft too hard to control at low
altitude and a hit on a reactor difficult, the study said.

The tests were conducted by ABS Consulting, which specializes in
quantifying losses from natural and man-made hazards such as fires,
earthquakes and missile impacts; and Anatech Corp., a San Diego
engineering firm that specializes in evaluating structural failures.

The sponsoring Electric Power Research Institute, based in Palo Alto,
Calif., is a nonprofit energy research consortium of the electric power
industry. After the September 11 attacks, the Nuclear Energy Institute
asked the consortium to develop the study.

Separate tests on reactor vulnerability to an aircraft crash, details
of which are classified, are under way at the government's Sandia
National Laboratory and elsewhere, said a spokesman for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

Spokesman William Beecher said he could not comment on the industry
tests without referring to classified information involving the
government tests. He said commission officials have been briefed on the
industry findings.

NYTimes Op-Ed
Security Doubts at Indian Point

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs to subject New York's Indian
Point nuclear plant to a stringent test of its ability to cope with a
terrorist attack as soon as possible. There is no other way to
determine whether the plant's security forces are blessed with
Rambo-like powers, as the industry claims, or are more like the
Keystone Kops, as an assessment from some of the guards themselves
suggests.

The ads on nuclear plant security that the industry ran earlier this
year depicted tough-looking men with big guns protecting unidentified
nuclear plants. "Meet Steve Yancey, formerly of the 82nd Airborne and
the U.S. Marine Corps," one ad said. It described Steve and his
colleagues as highly committed, exactingly trained and physically fit
and as expert marksmen with an array of weaponry.

Too bad the guards at Indian Point, some 35 miles north of Times
Square, do not quite fit that image. According to a leaked report
submitted to the plant's owners early this year, only 19 percent of the
guards, who are supplied by the Wackenhut Corporation, felt that they
could adequately defend the plant. Some guards estimated that half the
force might not be physically able to meet the demands. As for
marksmanship, some guards require multiple tries to pass their annual
tests.

These revelations were contained in a report prepared by a former
N.R.C. investigator who interviewed more than 50 guards at the plant.
In follow-up interviews, Richard Prez-Pea of The Times reported,
guards told of minimal training, of some guards' reporting to duty
drunk and having to be sent home, and of fatigue from working 70 to 80
hours a week or more.

Entergy, the company that owns and operates Indian Point, says that
most of the guards' concerns have been addressed. A new fence, barriers
and security cameras have been installed, for example, and 30 new
guards will report in January to help protect both Unit 2, where the
survey was done, and the adjacent Unit 3. National Guardsmen and state
police provide additional protection. Entergy remains convinced that
Indian Point's defenses are robust and that they could pass any test.

Security at Indian Point has passed muster with both the N.R.C., which
considers the site well protected against terrorists, and Gov. George
Pataki's own Office of Public Security. But the guards' assessment is
so jarringly at odds with those judgments, and with the industry's
tough-guy reassurances, that a closer look is needed.

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has urged both Entergy and the N.R.C. to
schedule a mock terrorist attack at Indian Point early next year to see
whether the security force can handle it. Entergy says it is willing.
The drill should use realistic assumptions about the size of an
attacking force and the likelihood that it would strike without
warning. If the regulators cannot ensure that the private guards are
competent and ready, it may be time to federalize the security force at
nuclear plants.

In an Upside-Down World, Sunshine Is Shunned
By LARRY ROHTER

PUNTA ARENAS, Chile -  Everything is different here at the bottom of the world,
starting with the weather. Before Alejandra Mundaca lets her two children go out,
she checks the forecast for the temperature, chances of rain and also the level of
ultraviolet rays.

For the last decade the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica has been forming
earlier in the Southern Hemisphere spring and growing larger. The 125,000 residents
of the southernmost city on the planet, here on the Strait of Magellan, have
reluctantly learned to adapt.

They closely watch the color-coded warnings of a "solar stoplight" publicized on
television and radio and even posted on street corners here. Even on warm days, most
people insist on wearing jackets or long-sleeved shirts or blouses. Many wear
sunglasses and make sure to apply 50-proof sunblock even when the sky is blanketed
in clouds.

"Life has changed a lot for us over the past few years, and I know that my sons are
not going to be able to enjoy the same kind of childhood that I had growing up
here," said Ms. Mundaca, 33, a schoolteacher. "We used to look forward to spring as
relief from the long harsh winter, but now it is a time of maximum peril for all of
us who live here."

The ozone layer is a thin covering of gas in the stratosphere that absorbs most of
the sun's ultraviolet rays. Since scientists first discovered the hole over
Antarctica in the mid-1980's, it has nearly doubled in size and now covers an area
larger than North America during the Southern Hemisphere spring. The arms of the
hole occasionally extend as far as southern Chile and Argentina, depending on wind
patterns.

On a typical day here this month, the solar stoplight was set at orange, the second
highest of four levels, and people were warned to limit their exposure to the sun
between noon and 3 p.m. to 21 minutes at most.

"When the light is red, I don't let my kids go out to play at all," Liliana Navarro
Torres said, referring to Kimberley, 6, and Jonathan, 4. "They don't like it much,
and sometimes it drives me crazy to have them running around the house, but that's
the way it has to be when you live here."

The growth of the ozone hole is attributed largely to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's,
that were widely used in aerosol sprays and refrigerants until an agreement in 1987
to phase them out. But scientists also think that global warming may be contributing
to the phenomenon.

During much of the 1990's there was resistance here to accepting signs that the
risks to people were growing. The warnings of scientists like Bedrich Magas of
Magallanes University, one of the first to emphasize the potential dangers, were
dismissed by local boosters who feared a drop in tourism.

But that changed in September 2000, when the ozone hole opened directly over Punta
Arenas. The Socialist government responded with a far-reaching prevention and
education program that has become visible everywhere.

"It's a new way of living," said Lidia Amarales Osorno, the Chilean Health
Ministry's regional director here. "You'll see the solar stoplight posted in
supermarkets, offices and schools, and we even have an Ozone Brigade to raise
consciousness about this problem."

In elementary schools, a giant penguin named Paul leads a permanent campaign to
teach children the steps they need to take to protect themselves. Many schools also
hoist a flag each morning to alert their pupils' families of the expected level of
ultraviolet rays, and in some poor neighborhoods, skin creams are even distributed
free to youngsters.

"But the truth is that there is only so much that we can do here ourselves," Dr.
Amarales said.

This year, to everyone's bafflement, the situation has been relatively mild. The
ozone hole split in two for only the second time since monitoring began, with only
the smaller part passing over Punta Arenas, winds have been calmer than usual, and
the hole has begun to retract earlier than usual.

But scientists here warn that the problem may persist until the middle of the
century and is likely to worsen through the decade.

The laboratory here has also reported the appearance of smaller ozone holes in
central Chile, and health officials say that the incidence of melanoma, the most
common form of skin cancer, in Santiago, the country's capital, increased by 105
percent between 1992 and 1998.

Because solar radiation reaches the ground at a more acute angle here than places
farther north, Punta Arenas may actually be at less risk than other parts of Chile.

But this time of year, atmospheric scientists from all over the world flock here
anyway, drawn by the opportunity to study a rare and little-understood phenomenon.
Their presence, rather than reassuring residents, only adds to their sense of
unease.

"We feel like we are rabbits in a laboratory experiment," said Ivan Mansilla Vera,
36, an engineer and father of two young children. "Nobody knows what is going to
happen to us."

American Ecology Set to Close a Plant
By BLOOMBERG NEWS

BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 27 (Bloomberg News) -  The American Ecology Corporation, which runs
hazardous-waste plants, expects to lay off about 20 percent of its work force after
closing a Tennessee plant that processes radioactive material.

Sixty-three jobs will be eliminated at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., plant, which reduces levels
of radioactivity in waste from nuclear plants, hospitals and research institutions. The
waste is then shipped to a competitor's plant in Utah for disposal, an American Ecology
spokesman, Chad Hyslop, said. The company employs about 300 people.

American Ecology is trying to sell the Oak Ridge plant, after losing more than $45
million since buying it in 1994. Federal regulations will not allow the company to
dispose of waste that is treated in Oak Ridge at its dump in Richland, Wash., Mr. Hyslop
said. "We never could make it profitable," he said.

By closing the operations, American Ecology, which is based in Boise, is seeking to
attract buyers interested in running other types of businesses on the site. A few
employees will continue to work at the plant to remove waste stored there, the company
said.

American Ecology Discontinues Radioactive Waste Processing by Oak Ridge, Tenn 
Subsidiary; Action Taken to Reduce Expenses and Better Position Subsidiary 
for Sale.

Business Wire, Dec 27, 2002
Business Editors
BOISE, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2002

Stephen Romano, president and chief executive officer of American Ecology 
Corporation (Nasdaq:ECOL), today announced that subsidiary American Ecology 
Recycle Center, Inc. ("AERC"), based in Oak Ridge, Tenn. is discontinuing 
processing of low-level radioactive waste ("LLRW") to reduce operating 
expenses and better position AERC for sale.

Romano also announced an associated labor force reduction of 63 employees. 
The subsidiary will retain a limited number of employees to oversee the 
removal of stored waste from the Oak Ridge site and maintain compliance with 
its radioactive materials license.

"Since October, when the Company announced its intention to market and sell 
AERC, American Ecology entered non-disclosure agreements with, and provided 
information to several interested parties, but to date have received no 
acceptable offers based on the Oak Ridge facility's historic mode of 
operations," Romano explained. "However, several potential buyers have 
expressed interest in acquiring AERC based on different business models," 
Romano added. Company management believes the discontinuation of LLRW 
processing and timely removal of waste will reduce losses and liabilities at 
the Oak Ridge facility, increasing its attractiveness to potential buyers.

Since purchasing AERC in 1994, the subsidiary has lost $45 million, including 
a substantial operating and net loss in 2001 and 2002 year-to-date. "The Oak 
Ridge commercial LLRW processing operation does not fit our core business 
model since the majority of wastes processed there are ineligible for burial 
at our disposal facilities," Romano said. American Ecology's profitable, core 
business is the treatment and disposal of hazardous, PCB and radioactive 
waste at sites in Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Washington.

American Ecology expects to continue to market AERC to qualified buyers while 
continuing to meet its radioactive materials license obligations.

Management expects that discontinuance of its LLRW processing operations will 
require the Company to take special charges, establish reserves and impair 
certain assets of AERC during the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company's 
preliminary, initial estimate for these special charges associated with 
discontinuing processing operations at Oak Ridge is in the range of 
approximately $6 million. The Company will report its 2002 fiscal year 
results, along with fourth quarter 2002 financial results, on February 24, 
2003.

"The reduction in our Oak Ridge workforce was a difficult but necessary 
decision in preparing to exit the commercial radioactive waste processing 
business," Romano stated, concluding, "We thank the affected employees at Oak 
Ridge for their past efforts."

American Ecology Corporation, through its subsidiaries, provides radioactive, 
PCB, hazardous, and non-hazardous waste services to commercial and government 
customers throughout the United States, such as nuclear power plants, steel 
mills, medical and academic institutions and petro-chemical facilities. 
Headquartered in Boise, Idaho, the Company is the oldest radioactive and 
hazardous waste services company in the United States.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our 
current expectations, beliefs, and assumptions about the industry and markets 
in which American Ecology Corporation and its subsidiaries operate. Actual 
results may differ materially from what is expressed herein and no assurance 
can be given that the Company can successfully implement its growth strategy, 
generate improved earnings, or conclude an agreement for the sale of 
subsidiary American Ecology Recycle Center, Inc. The current preliminary 
estimate for discontinued operations will be adjusted as additional facts 
become known and further analysis is performed. No assurance can be given 
that the estimated special charges associated with discontinued processing 
operations will not ultimately be higher than discussed herein. For 
information on other factors that could cause actual results to differ from 
expectations, please refer to American Ecology Corporation's Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

G.A.O. Suit Against Cheney's Energy Task Force Is Dismissed
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Monday rebuffed congressional efforts to
gather information about meetings that Vice President Dick Cheney's energy
task force held with industry executives and lobbyists as it was
formulating the administration's energy plan.

U.S. District Judge John Bates said the lawsuit filed by Comptroller
General David Walker against the vice president is an unprecedented act
that raises serious separation-of-powers issues between the executive and
legislative branches of government. Advertisement

"No court has ever before granted what the comptroller general seeks,"
wrote Bates, an appointee of President Bush.

The judge said that the comptroller general, who runs the General
Accounting Office, "does not have the personal, concrete and particularized
injury required" under the Constitution and that "his complaint must be
dismissed."

Courts historically have not stepped in to resolve disputes between the
political branches, wrote Bates.

"This case, in which neither a House of Congress nor any congressional
committee has issued a subpoena for the disputed information or authorized
this suit, is not the setting for such unprecedented judicial action,"
wrote the judge.

Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and John Dingell of Michigan
requested information in the spring of 2001 about which industry executives
and lobbyists the Cheney task force was meeting with in formulating the
Bush administration's energy plan.

As the dispute grew, Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and Byron
Dorgan of North Dakota joined the fight, urging that Cheney disclose data
about his industry meetings.

The Cheney energy plan called for expanded oil and gas drilling on public
land and easing regulatory barriers to building nuclear power plants. Among
the proposals: Drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge and possibly reviving
nuclear fuel reprocessing, which was abandoned in the 1970s as a nuclear
proliferation threat.

The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, argued that its statutory
responsibilities give it broad powers to investigate government programs
and demand almost all government documents required to help Congress.

In courtroom arguments in September, Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement
of the Justice Department said Congress has other ways to seek the
information other than relying on the GAO. Congress could subpoena them or
seek information through the appropriations process, said Clement.

Carter Phillips, an attorney representing the comptroller general, argued
that dismissing the case, as Cheney's attorney asked, would impede the
GAO's ability to do its work.

Phillips argued that the president and vice president are not immune from
the oversight responsibilities of Congress and noted that the White House
had refrained from invoking formal executive privilege to protect the
energy task force documents.

The suit asked the court to require Cheney to reveal who attended the
energy tax force meetings, with whom the task force met to develop its
energy recommendations, how it determined whom to invite and how much it
cost to develop the policy.

A small part of the Cheney task force's contacts has been revealed -- the
meetings with the executives of Enron Corp. Cheney's office released the
information last January amid political pressure that was building over the
collapse of the nation's seventh-largest corporation. Enron and its
executives have been George W. Bush's biggest political campaign
contributor over the years.

Cheney said that Enron representatives met six times with the vice
president or his aides about energy policy, including a discussion in
mid-October, 1 1/2 months before the company's collapse. Cheney's office
also said that former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay met once with Cheney.
Details of the discussions were not released.

While the Cheney task force's operations have remained largely a secret,
various federal agencies in lawsuits have been forced to release a wide
range of information about their industry contacts in assisting the Cheney
panel's efforts.

Separately, two private groups are suing the Cheney task force, seeking
release of documents about the industry contacts of the now-defunct Cheney
panel. It prepared the plan in the early months of Bush's presidency and
released it publicly in May 2001.

Director Quits Los Alamos Under Fire
By KENNETH CHANG

The director of the nation's pre-eminent nuclear weapons laboratory has resigned amid
investigations of corruption and missing equipment, officials said yesterday.

John C. Browne, director of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico since November
1997, submitted his resignation on Dec. 23, according to the University of California,
which manages the laboratory for the Department of Energy. Joseph Salgado, the
laboratory's principal deputy director, also resigned. The resignations will take effect
on Monday.

George P. Nanos, a retired Navy vice admiral who is a deputy associate director at Los
Alamos, will become interim director while the university looks for a permanent
replacement.

"These changes reflect the university's deep concern about the allegations that have been
made about Los Alamos business practices and our absolute and steadfast commitment to
addressing them in a timely manner," Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of
California, said.

The university said it delayed the announcement of the resignation until Admiral Nanos
had been selected as interim director and laboratory employees returned to work.

In a stern letter to Dr. Atkinson on Dec. 24, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said he
was "deeply concerned" about the situation at Los Alamos. Noting that in November the
laboratory fired two investigators looking into the accusations, Mr. Abraham wrote that
the reported abuses "reflect a systematic management failure, one for which laboratory
management must be held accountable."

The University of California has run Los Alamos under contract to the federal government
since the laboratory was founded in 1943, developing during World War II the world's
first atomic bombs. The latest five-year contract extension began in January 2001.

But Mr. Abraham said in his letter that "taken together, these problems have called into
question the University of California's ability to run the Los Alamos National
Laboratory."

Other management changes will put the laboratory under closer scrutiny. Los Alamos's
auditor, administrators and business managers will now report directly to the university
president instead of the laboratory's chief administrator. A management oversight board
will be appointed to help Admiral Nanos.

In March, Glenn Walp, a former chief of the Arizona Capitol police hired by the
laboratory, wrote a memorandum to Los Alamos administrators outlining more than $3
million worth of equipment than had been reported lost from October 1998 to September
2001. An investigation also found credit card abuses, including an employee who tried to
buy a $30,000 Ford Mustang.

Another investigator, Steven Doran, who was police chief of Idaho City, Idaho, before
being hired by Los Alamos in July, said yesterday that he and Mr. Walp had uncovered
rampant abuse in the use of the laboratory's credit cards and purchase orders. Laboratory
employees -  primarily members of the support staff, not the scientists -  had bought
expensive lawn furniture, barbecue grills, gift certificates for massages, jewelry and
even $9,000 worth of military knives, Mr. Doran said.

"We found just an extensive abuse and misuse of taxpayer dollars, in the millions," he
said. "It's part of the culture. Even now, they truly cannot see the error of their
ways."

Mr. Doran said that when he was fired he was told only that he "did not fit in with lab
culture."

A review by a former inspector general for the Energy Department and accountants at
PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. found $3.7 million of unreconciled purchases. But the
laboratory said that as of Dec. 18 all but $121,000 of its purchasing accounts had been
reconciled, and $20,000 worth of questionable transactions were still being reviewed.

"The allegation that there are millions of dollars of Los Alamos property involved in the
misuse of credit cards is absolutely false, and that was proven by this external review,"
said Linn Tytler, a laboratory spokeswoman.

At the time of the firings, Philip Kruger, the deputy human resources director for Los
Alamos, said the firings were not in retaliation, but "were related to loss of
confidence."

Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Energy's
inspector general's office and Congress are also looking into the accusations.

N.R.C. Excludes Terrorism as Licensing Consideration
By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 -  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ruled that the threat of
terrorism cannot be considered when licensing reactors or other nuclear installations
because the risk is too speculative.

The commission also said discussing the issue in licensing hearings would give too much
information to terrorists and might "unduly alarm the public."

The ruling, made late last month, covers a factory that Duke Energy and other companies
are seeking to build in South Carolina to turn weapons plutonium into reactor fuel; two
existing Duke reactor plants that would use the plutonium fuel; a temporary waste-storage
project in Utah; and a project to expand fuel storage at the Millstone reactors in
Waterford, Conn.

The commission said that it defined risk as a product of the probability of an event
multiplied by its consequences, but that in the Utah case, which involves building
concrete and steel casks to store highly radioactive nuclear fuel, "we have no way to
calculate the probability portion of the equation, except in such general terms as to be
nearly meaningless."

The ruling has outraged some nuclear-safety experts. Victor Gilinsky, one of the five
members of the regulatory commission in the 1970's and 80's, complained that at a time
when the commission forbids considering terrorism at the Duke plutonium plant, "Ashcroft
is changing the Bill of Rights because it is imminent."

Dr. Edwin Lyman, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, an antiproliferation group
in Washington, said the decision was contradictory. The commission reasoned that it need
not consider terrorism, because terrorism is "entirely independent of the facility," Dr.
Lyman pointed out.

But that, he added, "ignores the fact that the terrorist threat to a facility is surely
dependent on where that facilities is sited, i.e. in a remote or densely populated area."

"One of the main threats we face today in the U.S. is that many potentially hazardous
facilities are located near heavily populated areas," Dr. Lyman wrote in an e-mail
message. "This situation is tolerated because severe accidents are considered highly
improbable. But surely in the future, it makes sense to consider the possibility of
terrorist acts that could intentionally cause large releases when making decisions about
the location and design features of hazardous facilities."

The commission ruling took note of the Sept. 11 attacks. It said the proper approach
would be to improve security at nuclear sites, on airplanes and around the country
generally, rather than to try to determine the environmental effects of "a third-party
attack" on a site.

In the past, design features at nuclear plants proposed to ensure environmental safety
had been available for public scrutiny. But the commission said security preparations and
characteristics of plants that would bear on the success of a terrorist attack would
remain secret.

The commission ruled that terrorism could not be considered under the National
Environmental Policy Act, the law that requires the government to issue an Environmental
Impact Statement when it takes a major action.

Diane Curran, a lawyer in Washington who has represented nuclear opponents in several
cases where considering terrorism was forbidden, said that opponents could try to raise
the same arguments under the Atomic Energy Act, but that under that law, the regulatory
commission was free to ignore them.

Only in the environmental impact statement process is the government required to respond,
Ms. Curran said, and thus the decision was a major setback for opponents.

Peter A. Bradford, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1977 to 1982,
compared the commission's attitude to its view on hydrogen explosions. Before the
accident in 1979 at Three Mile Island in Middletown, Pa., Mr. Bradford said, such
explosions were considered impossible. After the one at Three Mile Island, he said, the
commission still considered them impossible, "because now that we had had one, we would
be too vigilant for another to occur."

"The bottom line is that events that have occurred but that can't be dealt with must
still be considered impossible, first because they haven't yet occurred, then because
they have," he said.

The commission has historically declined to speculate about terrorist threats against
reactors. In the late 80's and early 90's, it fought off arguments that it needed
stronger defenses against truck bombs, despite truck bomb attacks around the world. The
commission argued that in the United States no bomb could be assembled without attracting
the notice of the police. But in early 1993, terrorists exploded a truck bomb in an
underground garage at the World Trade Center and a man with a history of mental problems
drove his station wagon through an open gate at Three Mile Island and drove into the
turbine building. The man, who was not armed, hid inside the plant for hours.

Shortly after that, the commission revised its rules to cover bombs in small vehicles.
But it has not instituted any sweeping rules related to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

"They are closing the barn door from yesterday," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety
engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The commission, Mr. Lochbaum said, should be more forward looking. But he added that
nuclear engineers were "not good on qualitative analysis" and that the commission's
problem was that it was confronting a problem with a lack of data points on major
terrorist attacks.

Regulators' Wariness Kept a Damaged A-Plant Open
By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 -  Three months before workers refueling an Ohio nuclear reactor
discovered last year that its lid had rusted nearly all the way through, the staff of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission drafted an order to close it for inspection.

But the order was never issued, because the staff doubted its authority to close the
plant, did not want to impose unnecessary costs on the owner and was reluctant to give
the industry a black eye, according to an internal commission report released today.

The report, by the commission's inspector general, concluded that the staff had been too
hesitant and that a policy adopted by the N.R.C. in the mid-1990's to take costs into
account when setting regulatory requirements was in conflict with the commission's goal
of maintaining reasonable assurance of public safety.

But the basic problem, the report said, was the staff's assumption about who had the
burden of proof -  the commission or a plant's operator -  when safety was in question.

The commission "appears to have informally established an unreasonably high burden of
requiring" of itself "absolute proof of a safety problem, versus lack of reasonable
assurance of maintaining public health and safety," said the inspector general, Hubert T.
Bell.

The report, dated Dec. 30, was issued today after an account about it appeared this
morning in the Cleveland daily The Plain Dealer. Its sharp criticism of the commission's
staff concerned the belated nature of the shutdown of the Davis-Besse reactor, near
Toledo, last year.

Other reactors of the same design had been found to have cracks in parts attached to the
lid, and the commission wanted all such plants inspected by Dec. 31, 2001. The operators
of the Davis-Besse plant wanted to wait until March 2002, when the reactor was scheduled
to be shut anyway for refueling.

When the plant finally closed, on a compromise date in February 2002, engineers and
workers were shocked to find that cracks of the kind the commission staff had suspected
there had let acidic water leak onto the head, where it had eaten away a 70-pound chunk
of steel six inches thick.

Only a layer of stainless steel about a quarter-inch thick had prevented the cooling
water from spewing out of the vessel head, in a leak that could have proved catastrophic.
The corrosion was the most extensive ever found at an American nuclear plant.

Three months earlier, in November 2001, the commission's staff had drafted a shutdown
order. But some staff members were not sure they had the authority to issue it, the
inspector general's report found. Others thought that it might not be defensible in
court, and that such an order would "destabilize confidence" in the industry.

William M. Beecher, director of the commission's public affairs office, said the N.R.C.
received the report on Thursday and had not yet determined how it would respond. But, he
said, "the N.R.C. has the unquestionable and unquestioned authority to shut down a plant
if it concludes that public health and safety is potentially in jeopardy."

Such shutdown orders were common in the 1970's and 1980's, when reactors were newer and
operating problems were first occurring. They are rarer now. In the mid-1990's, the
commission adopted a policy called "risk-informed regulation," in which it pays more
careful attention to the costs it imposes on plant operators, comparing those costs with
the amount of risk reduction they provide.

But Mr. Beecher said that while the commission and its staff do take costs into account,
"the primary and overarching requirement, concern, standard, for the N.R.C. is public
health and safety."

"Anything else," he said, "is secondary or tertiary."

As for the concern about having to defend such an order in court, the new report
determined that the fear of a lawsuit had been unfounded. The president of the
FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company, which runs Davis-Besse, told the inspector general
that no formal shutdown order would have been required; he would have closed the plant
had the commission simply telephoned and asked him to do so, he said.

The inspector general undertook his investigation at the request of the Union of
Concerned Scientists, a safety group that is generally highly critical of nuclear
operations.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer with the group, said in an interview that shutting
down early for a special inspection would not have been an undue burden on Davis-Besse.
Other reactors suspected of cracks in the lids did just that, Mr. Lochbaum said.

A Nuclear Horror Story

The more we learn about a case of severe corrosion discovered at a nuclear plant in Ohio
last March, the more frightening the incident appears. The corrosion, which ate nearly
all the way through the thick lid of a reactor, left the vessel dangerously vulnerable to
rupturing. Even more alarming were the slipshod industrial practices and lax regulatory
oversight that allowed it to happen. If those practices are not changed, the same
pressure to keep reactors operating while ignoring warning signs may threaten the safety
of nuclear plants all around the country.

The corrosion was found almost by accident at the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Oak
Harbor, about 25 miles east of Toledo. For several years operators had missed the
significance of warning signs that boric acid was leaking and accumulating in potentially
dangerous amounts. During inspections last February, a workman stumbled onto hidden
corrosion that shocked everybody. Boric acid had eaten through six inches of carbon
steel, leaving only a stainless steel liner about a quarter-inch thick to hold in
high-pressure cooling water.

When investigators looked into the matter afterward, they found disturbing evidence that
both the First Energy Nuclear Operating Company, which runs Davis-Besse, and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission had put production interests ahead of safety. The industry's own
oversight group, The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, concluded in November that
the power company had shifted focus from "implementing high standards to justifying
minimum standards." It accused the company of excessive focus on production goals and
"lack of sensitivity to nuclear safety."

Unfortunately, the regulatory agency that was supposed to ride herd on unsafe plants was
equally negligent. A report just released by the N.R.C.'s inspector general concludes
that the regulatory staff was slow to order Davis-Besse to shut down for inspection, in
large part because it did not want to impose unnecessary costs on the owner and did not
want to give the industry a black eye. Although the N.R.C. insists that safety remains
its top priority, its timidity in this case cries out for a searching Congressional
inquiry into whether the regulators can still be counted on to protect the public from
cavalier reactor operators.

Budget problems create kink in plan to clean air
By DINA CAPPIELLO
Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle Environment Writer

With an anticipated multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, state
lawmakers enter the session this week facing a conundrum in their
effort to clean up Texas' air: Either find a way to fund a $188
million-a-year pollution reduction scheme or deal with the loss of
millions more in federal highway money.

The issue dwarfs all other environmental matters expected in the
coming session, including efforts to fund a variety of water
programs, ban all-terrain vehicles from fragile riverbeds and agree
on a place to build a low-level radioactive waste dump.

"Ultimately, this session is about filling the promise for cleaner
air," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of the Austin-based advocacy
group Public Citizen.

At the heart of the dilemma is Senate Bill 5, a piece of legislation
passed in the waning hours of the 2001 Legislature. The bill
established a package of incentives to encourage governments,
industries and individuals to replace dirty engines with cleaner
technology. Under the program, entities can apply for state grants
to offset the cost of converting equipment.

A fee on vehicles transferred from out of state would have paid for
most of the incentives. But it was later ruled unlawful, leaving the
program without much funding.

The so-called Texas Emissions Reductions Program is a cornerstone in
plans to meet a federal mandate for reducing air pollution by 2007
in the smog-choked Dallas and Houston areas. Already, the Port of
Houston Authority has taken advantage of the TERP incentives to
replace engines, and H-E-B has used them to convert a dozen local
grocery store trucks to natural gas.

To date, the state has awarded $14 million in grants. The technology
upgrades have cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 550 tons a year,
mostly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

But the Dallas and Houston clean-air plans will both be scrapped
unless the Legislature fully funds the program by September. Without
it, neither area would be able to meet federal guidelines and the
state could lose millions in federal highway funds for not meeting
the deadline.

"It puts us out on a limb. If the program isn't funded, the Dallas
and Houston air plans die," said Gregg Cooke, the former regional
administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which
approved the Houston plan on the condition that the incentive
program be funded.

Houston's air plan is already about 56 tons per day short of meeting
federal air quality standards. In December, the state said the
yet-to-be-funded incentives package would eliminate a quarter of
that gap.

And while the Dallas air plan has not yet been approved, Cooke said
it would be impossible for the EPA to endorse it without the
incentives program.

"If we don't solve the SB 5 problem, it all comes tumbling down," he
said.

The looming deadline has lawmakers, environmentalists, state
officials and industry lobbyists talking about how to come up with
the money.

When the bill was introduced two years ago by then-Sen. Buster
Brown, R-Lake Jackson, about 80 percent of the funding was to come
from taxes on vehicle inspections, new vehicle purchases, hotel
bills and taxi rides in polluted areas.

But lawmakers, wary of reaction to a host of new fees, opted instead
to raise the money by dramatically increasing the fee people pay on
their vehicles when they move to Texas from out of state. That
increase was challenged in court and found to violate commerce laws.

Therefore, it is before lawmakers again.

"SB 5 will be the primary environmental issue facing Texas next
session," said Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock. "It's not just a
Houston-Dallas issue, it's a state issue."

The challenge is formidable. When lawmakers return to Austin on
Tuesday, they will face at least a $5 billion budget shortfall and a
Legislature stocked with new faces and controlled for the first time
in 130 years by Republicans.

"We are in the unenviable position of getting this funding against a
tough budget background," said Robert Huston, chairman of the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. "The agency's position is to
maintain the equity and spread this burden very widely across all
operators of engines."

One lawmaker, Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, has proposed placing a
tax on engines larger than 50 horsepower.

Some environmentalists would like a tax placed on barrels of
high-sulfur fuel, which is responsible for the bulk of pollution
from diesel engines. There is also talk of a sliding fee scale based
on the cleanliness of a person's car, and a fee on incandescent
lamps and traditional light bulbs.

Either way, everyone agrees that the incentives program of Senate
Bill 5 needs to be funded.

"I know of no organized group that opposes full funding of this
plan," said Anne Culver, a lobbyist for the Greater Houston
Partnership. "It's a key component to compliance."

Nuclear Waste Removed at Washington Site
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SPOKANE, Wash., Jan. 11 -  Workers have finished removing more than two million pounds of highly
radioactive spent nuclear fuel from a cold war-era storage pool on the Hanford nuclear
reservation, an official says.

Removal of the 957 metric tons from the K West Basin, 400 yards from the Columbia River, is a
milestone in Hanford's 60-year history, said the official, Dave Van Leuven, a vice president of
Fluor Hanford, the Energy Department's contractor.

"Moving this fuel and getting the fuel into dry storage represents the most significant cleanup
accomplishment at this site in 60 years," Mr. Van Leuven said on Wednesday. "The fact we
removed half of this high-risk fuel is significant."

Fluor Hanford has been cleaning, drying and packaging spent fuel from the K West Basin since
December 2000. The job was supposed to have been finished by Dec. 31, 2002, under the Tri-Party
Agreement, the legal pact among state and federal agencies that governs cleanup at Hanford, in
central Washington.

Workers have now shifted to moving fuel assemblies stored in the K East Basin, which is closer
to the Columbia River and has leaked twice since the 1980's.

"We are on a path to have the entire amount of fuel out on schedule," Mr. Van Leuven said.

The cleanup at K West is a small part of the project.

Radioactive Dump on Wildlife Refuge Raises Liability Concerns
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 -  In the 1950's and 60's, the United States Air Force conducted 12
test launchings of nuclear missiles on tiny Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. In 1962,
two of the shots were aborted and the missiles exploded over the runway, drenching the
area in radioactive contaminants.

In November, 40 years after those two failed missions, the Air Force finished burying
thousands of cubic meters of plutonium-contaminated waste in a 25-acre landfill on the
atoll. In 2004, the military is to leave the atoll, which was designated a wildlife
refuge in 1926, in the care of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

But the Fish and Wildlife Service is worried about potential liability from the
radioactive dump and is not particularly enthused about the duties of caring for the
atoll, a nesting ground for green sea turtles, a habitat for 300 species of fish and an
essential resting ground for 20 species of migratory birds.

The wildlife service's regional director, Anne Badgley, wrote to the military in July
that the plutonium-contaminated waste in the landfill "should be shipped off-island to a
radioactive waste facility."

So before the Defense Department can turn over the property, it has to negotiate with
wildlife officials the delineation of responsibilities in case the landfill erodes or is
breached and the toxic material leaks out.

The United States used Johnston's four islands, totaling just 690 acres less than 800
miles southwest of Honolulu, not only to test nuclear missiles, but also to store and
incinerate nerve gas and chemical weapons until 2000. Now, environmental organizations
say, the Defense Department is leaving the island to stew in its own lethal juices.

John F. Ahearne, former chairman of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now a
lecturer in risk and regulation at Duke University, said it was difficult to assess
whether the development of nuclear weapons was worth long-term environmental
contamination.

"You can never know if developing the weapons prevented a large-scale nuclear war," Mr.
Ahearne said. "But you can say that developing the weapons led to a lot of environmental
problems that we're working very hard to figure out what to do with, and it will take
decades and a lot of money to clean it up."

While the Department of Energy alone has spent more than $70 billion over the last 13
years to address the environmental legacy of the arms race, he said, that actual cleanup
was difficult.

Johnston Atoll is just one of hundreds of sites where the government used nuclear weapons
and produced nuclear waste. While Johnston's waste may be comparatively remote,
environmental organizations are worried about the potential threat it poses, in part
because much of Johnston Island is landfill itself, expanded more than 10 times its
original size to accommodate a launch pad.

The Earth Foundation, an environmental group based in Maui, says that during hurricanes
the atoll can be completely submerged. And a Pentagon study says the island's sea wall
will fail in less than 50 years. Roy Smith, an environmental engineer in Hawaii, said
that because of the rough weather and the fact that the landfill is unlined, "at some
point, the whole load is going to fall into the ocean."

The foundation said that the contaminants could be absorbed by fish and carried by ocean
currents to the coasts of Hawaii, California, Japan and South America. These fears
prompted the foundation and the Fish and Wildlife Service to propose shipping the
material to a repository in the continental United States, like the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.

In the 1980's, several contaminated structures on the island were dismantled and sent to
the Nevada Test Site for burial.

"We don't normally have wildlife refuges that have a plutonium landfill," said Don
Palawski, project leader of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex,
based in Honolulu, which oversees eight islands, including Johnston, for the Fish and
Wildlife Service.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a branch of the Defense Department, conducted public
hearings on Johnston's problem and rejected the idea of shipping more waste to the United
States. The agency said the radioactivity was too low to harm humans or to justify the
estimated $55 million it could cost to move the waste.

Instead, the military spent $1.5 million to create a landfill on the island and buried
the waste there.

Now the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is conducting an ecological risk assessment of
the area, and, with the Fish and Wildlife Service, is trying to develop a memorandum of
understanding before the service assumes control of the dump.

"From our standpoint," said Mr. Palawski of the Fish and Wildlife Service, "we need a few
things: a physical monitoring of the landfill to ensure its integrity over the long term,
to ensure that we don't have any plutonium to which humans could be exposed years from
now; a long-term agreement on liability and responsibility; and if it leaks, we don't
want to be responsible for putting it back in the landfill. We want to be able to get on
the phone and say, `We have a little issue here, and we want you to come and fix it.' "

Harry Stumpf, a geologist and oceanographer with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and
program manager for the Johnston project, said: "The levels of plutonium and
radioactivity are so low as to present no significant risk to either humans, wildlife or
plant life."

Mr. Stumpf also said he had "no concern whatsoever" about leaks. "The material is two to
three times denser than lead," he said. "If it got into the water at all, all it would do
is sink." He said that because the risk is so low, the Defense Department "is not likely
to fund any sea wall maintenance or repair."

Nonetheless, he said, at the request of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the landfill was
capped and compacted with extra soil so birds would not be harmed if they burrowed into
it.

And he is working on the memorandum of understanding on how the site should be managed in
case of problems.

"We recognize that every particle of plutonium out there has our name on it," he said.
"We'll never be off the hook for liability. If by some chance something gets exposed at
the surface, if the sea wall fails and the landfill collapses, Fish and Wildlife is
supposed to give us a call and we'll take appropriate action at that point. We know we'll
never be able to wash our hands of that."

JAPAN: RULING A BLOW TO NUCLEAR PROGRAM A court dealt a severe blow to the country's
nuclear energy program, upholding the suspension of operations at an accident-plagued
experimental reactor. The ruling by the Nagoya High Court on behalf of local residents,
the first of its kind against nuclear reactor operations in Japan, nullified the central
government's approval to operate the Monju plant, a so-called fast-breeder. "It's
virtually impossible now to resume operations at Monju," Miwako Ogiso, a representative
of the plaintiffs, said at a news conference. The $6 billion reactor has been shut since
a huge leak of sodium coolant in December 1995, but the government has intended to resume
operations.

JAPAN: WHERE'S THE PLUTONIUM? An official at the government's nuclear safety office said
that more than 450 pounds of plutonium, enough to produce 25 or more nuclear bombs, was
unaccounted for at a troubled nuclear complex at Tokaimura on the Pacific coast, but he
blamed faulty measurements rather than criminal activity. The official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the case had been reported to the International Atomic
Energy Agency. About 205 pounds is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without
being measured, the official said, adding that another 64 pounds disintegrated into a
different type of element. The rest may have "stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste
water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of."    Howard W. French

Study Warns Attack on Fuel Could Pose Serious Hazards
By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 2003-  A successful terrorist attack on a spent fuel storage pool at a
large nuclear reactor could have consequences "significantly worse than Chernobyl,"
according to a new scientific study. But it said the risk could be cut sharply by moving
some of the spent fuel to dry casks near the reactors and making changes in how the rest
is stored. Advertisement

The report, which will be published this spring in a scientific journal of Princeton
University, is one of the few broad analyses of the risk posed by spent fuel that is
being made public. Because there is no long-term storage site for nuclear fuel, the risk
it poses would persist for years even if the reactors where it is now stored are shut
down, as some critics are seeking for the Indian Point plants in New York.

Many reactor operators have already moved some fuel to dry casks because their pools have
filled up as the federal program to bury the fuel has slipped further into the future.
Burial can be done only with fuel that is more than five years old, because newer fuel
gives off so much heat that it must be kept in water. The older fuel can be kept dry
because air will safely dissipate its heat. It would cost $3.5 billion to $7 billion to
move old fuel to dry casks, the authors predicted.

But if the federal government opens a burial site at Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas, as it
says it will in about a decade, some of that money will have to be spent anyway to put
fuel in casks for shipment to a permanent burial site. The paper will appear in the
spring issue of Science and Global Security, a journal at Princeton. Some of its eight
authors began briefing federal officials in Washington today. Their recommendations
include reinforcing the casks to make them less vulnerable and designing them so that if
a large airplane were crashed into them, the plane's fuel could not pool around them and
overheat them as it burned. The nuclear industry has generally argued that a successful
attack is highly unlikely. At the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade
association, Stephen D. Floyd, a senior director, said that an aircraft could not do the
job, and that adversaries could not assemble a larger attack without attracting
attention.

Security improvements, Mr. Floyd said, should be limited to those that address realistic
threats. "Otherwise you're going to chase your tail and spend this country out of
existence on what-if scenarios," he said.

Today, two of the authors briefed one of the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Edward McGaffigan Jr., who said the study overstated the possible effects. At
Indian Point, Mr. McGaffigan said, even if terrorists could puncture a spent fuel pool,
it would be very difficult to drain the water because the fuel is almost entirely below
ground.

"If you're at all rational as an Al Qaeda planner, you don't choose this target where you
have a probability of failure," he said. "You have other targets where you have a higher
probability of success."

But the authors, reviewing European tests and other studies, suggest that a plane moving
fast enough could cause the building over a spent fuel pool to collapse, or could create
an explosion under a pool.

The authors say that the industry has raised the risk by reconfiguring its pools over the
years to squeeze in more and more fuel and that in their current configuration the pools
are vulnerable to heating up and catching fire if they are breached. Nuclear experts,
including at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, acknowledge that the vulnerability of the
pools has increased because they are so full. With older fuel removed, the authors say,
remaining fuel could be spread out, and reactor operators could install air-moving
equipment that could help keep it cool even if the pool were drained. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission ruled in December that it was impossible to determine the
likelihood of a terrorist attack and thus has resisted using its standard method for
deciding whether to make improvements, which is to multiply the probability of an event
with its consequences, and using the product to rank the hazard and determine how much
should be spent to reduce it. "This situation calls for more explicit guidance from
Congress," the paper said. Nuclear plants create radioactive material as they operate,
splitting atoms of uranium, which are only slightly radioactive, into a variety of
products that are highly unstable and give off gamma rays or subatomic particles to
achieve stability. Nearly all the radioactive material stays inside the fuel, which
continues to generate heat over the years as it gives off radiation.

When the nuclear plants were designed, engineers believed that the fuel would be removed
quickly from the pools, and were more concerned about releases from inside the
containment, where water and steam at high temperatures and pressures seemed more prone
to escape. Spent fuel pools are designed to withstand earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes
and other natural hazards, but were not explicitly designed with terrorism in mind. The
authors plan to brief some members of Congress on Thursday. The authors include Frank N.
von Hippel, a Princeton physicist; Gordon R. Thompson, director of the nonprofit
Institute for Resource and Security Studies, in Cambridge, Mass.; Alison Macfarlane, of
the Securities Studies Program and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Edwin
Lyman, president of the Nuclear Control Institute; and Robert Alvarez, a former adviser
to the energy secretary.

Buddy West to chair House energy board

By Bill Kidd
Special to the Odessa American

AUSTIN -  Odessa legislator G.E. "Buddy" West received a committee
chairmanship Thursday from fellow Republican and neighboring West Texas
lawmaker Speaker Tom Craddick of Midland. West said he was "very pleased
and honored" to have been selected by Craddick to chair the House Committee
on Energy Resources, which deals with oil and gas matters. West was also
named to the Committee on Environmental Regulation and Committee on House
Administration. West, serving his sixth term in the House, represents
Ector, Andrews and Winkler counties. His committee assignments will enable
him to deal with issues of interest to his legislative district, West said.
"There are several things in West Texas that those committees will be
looking at," West said. "I look forward to working with the Railroad
Commission on the Wink Sink and Kermit Sink. Both of those are in my
district." West was referring to sinkholes that have left gaping holes in
the ground near Wink and Kermit. "The oil and gas industry in the Permian
Basin is very important to our livelihood," West said. "It's important to
the entire state, not just West Texas." Morris Burns, executive director of
the Permian Basin Petroleum Association in Midland, said West's appointment
was "great." "Buddy has a lot of experience. He served on that committee a
number of times É and he knows it and knows those issues," Burns said.
Martin Fleming, vice president of public affairs for the Texas Independent
Producers and Royalty Owners Association, said choosing someone from and
oil and gas producing area to chair the committee "shows great leadership
by the speaker." "We're excited about the opportunities to work with them,"
Fleming said. The Energy Resources panel is charged with considering
legislation that deals with production, regulation and transportation of
oil, gas and other energy resources; mining, development, leasing and
regulation of mineral rights, and pipeline operations and utility
regulation as it relates to energy production and consumption. Burns said
if a measure were to be filed seeking changes to existing operator bonding
statutes, it would first go to West's committee. "That committee considers
any type of rules changes. Any bills other than tax bills," Burns said.
Burns said the Energy Resources panel is "definitely not" the potted plants
of House committees. "It's a very important committee, of course, for the
oil and gas folks," Burns said. West said his background in the oil and gas
industry will help in guiding the committee's efforts to manage the
conservation of Texas' energy resources, and to find innovative methods for
protecting and improving production. He also noted that the Environmental
Regulation assignment is a good fit, in light of efforts in Andrews County
to establish a low-level radioactive waste disposal site. The committee is
charged with addressing pollution and environmental protection issues.
Legislation on the Andrews County low-level radioactive waste site probably
will originate in the Senate with Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Andrews, and be
considered in the House committee after Senate passage, West said. The
Administration Committee is charged with housekeeping and administrative
matters affecting the Texas House of Representatives. West said he also
will be monitoring closely higher education issues, noting the presence of
Odessa College, University of Texas of the Permian Basin, Texas Tech
University Health Science Center, Sul Ross State University and other
institutions in the area. He also plans to seek approval of legislation
dealing with child pornography and requiring a two-thirds vote by
legislators for any tax increase.

U.S. Plans to Rejoin Project to Develop Fusion Reactor
By KENNETH CHANG

The United States will seek to join a $5 billion international project to build an
experimental fusion reactor, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced yesterday.

"Now is the time to expand our scope and embrace international efforts to realize the
promise of fusion energy," Mr. Abraham said at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in
New Jersey. "Now it is time to take the next step on the way to having fusion deliver
electricity to the grid."

The United States left the same project in 1998, calling it too costly and too ambitious.
The design was then scaled back and the budget cut in half. Last month, a committee
convened by the National Research Council recommended that the United States rejoin the
project, known as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER. The
participants are considering Canada, France, Spain and Japan as possible sites for the
reactor.

Fusion has long been an attractive potential energy source. Using the same process that
lights the sun, fusion produces energy by combining hydrogen atoms into helium. Hydrogen
is readily available, and fusion reactors would not produce long-lived highly radioactive
waste like current nuclear fission reactors.

But progress toward continuous, controlled fusion reactions has been slow, and even
proponents believe commercial fusion power plants are decades away.

The United States would contribute about 10 percent of the construction costs of the
reactor, or about $500 million over eight years, according to a news release from the
Energy Department. That would be a smaller share than at least some of the project's
current partners, Russia, the European Union, Japan and Canada. China has also announced
it would like to join the project.

Mr. Abraham did not indicate whether the administration's budget proposal for next year,
to be released on Monday, would include an increase in financing for fusion research.
Fusion research was cut by a third in 1996 and has remained flat since then at about $250
million a year.

In his speech, Mr. Abraham said that joining ITER "in no way means a lesser role for the
fusion programs we undertake here at home." He added, "It is imperative that we maintain
and enhance our strong domestic research program."

Most American fusion scientists support entering ITER negotiations, but also want to
continue design work on a smaller alternative reactor that the United States could build
alone should the project hit additional snags.

Energy officials will attend meetings next month in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the
ITER participants will discuss where the reactor will be built and how to divide the
costs and responsibilities among the partners.

The reactor, even its scaled-back design, would still produce much more power than its
predecessors. The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory,
which closed in 1997, generated a maximum of 11 megawatts of energy for one-third of a
second. ITER is designed to generate up to 500 megawatts for up to an hour. That would
allow examination of a regime known as "burning plasma" where most of the heating of the
hydrogen gas comes from the fusion reactions, not from the electricity powering the
reactor.

Construction of the reactor is scheduled to begin in 2006, with experiments starting in
2014

ABC NEWS
High Level of Plutonium in Los Alamos Storm Runoff
Reuters
Jan. 31 2003

-  SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) - Rainwater runoff from Los Alamos National Laboratory
contained levels of plutonium that were three-times higher than U.S. guideline levels, a
spokesman for the state's Environment Department said on Friday.

The concentration of plutonium-239 measured in the runoff from six storms in 2001 and 2002 were
more than triple the U.S. Department of Energy's "derived concentration guideline," and over
100 times the level of water samples taken from 1995 to 1999, said Jon Goldstein, a spokesman
for the state Environment Department.

Massive forest fires in 2000, which encircled the famed nuclear lab where the first atomic bomb
was made, were mostly to blame because the blazes destroyed large amounts of vegetation in the
area, said Goldstein.

He added that without vegetation to hold the sediment, the runoff "flows directly into the Rio
Grande."

Lab officials said the plutonium levels pose no threat to human health or to the environment,
and were to be expected following the devastating Cerro Grande Fire in the summer of 2000.

"Much of the plutonium we're seeing is the result of former lab operations conducted during the
Cold War," said lab spokesman James Rickman, noting that two separate studies of the possible
runoff risks began immediately following the Cerro Grande fire.

"The bottom line is that even in the worst-case scenario, we found there is not an elevated
risk to human health or the environment from exposure to these radionuclides," he said.

Plutonium-239 is a radioactive, man-made element produced since the 1940s for use in nuclear
weapons and it has a radioactive half-life of] 24,000 years.

Lab officials said they have been working closely with local and federal government agencies to
stabilize the movement of contaminated sediment and to increase vegetation in the area, which
will help reduce erosion.

Urgent Yet Methodical, Search Traverses a Vast Terrain
February 5, 2003
By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN 

MELROSE, Tex., Feb. 4 - When the sun came up, they set off,
walking six abreast through scratchy fields marked with
anthills, cow pies and little red flags. 
They carried Radiac meters, photo-ionizers, tongs, spoons
and yards of Ziplocs. 

Their job: to locate every single bit of the space shuttle
they could, test it for hazardous material, map it, bag it
and bring it back to headquarters. 

"Chicken house? Chicken house?" asked George Pearson, an
Army lieutenant in charge of one of the recovery teams.
"Where the heck is this chicken house?" 

"There's a little-bitty computer thing out there," a state
trooper said, motioning in the direction of the elusive
chicken house. 

"Where?" Lt. Pearson asked. 

"Somewhere out yonder." 

Another day, another little piece
for the debris team. 
Each morning, more teams fan out across the woods and hills
of east Texas. Some ride horses, others search by
helicopter. Some just mark items, others retrieve them. The
teams consist of police officers, National Guardsmen,
environmental scientists and mapping experts. They have
found more than 15,000 pieces of the space shuttle
Columbia, from bean-sized bits of metal to a length of the
Columbia's cabin, a helmet, a door - and many body parts. 

The hunt has been complicated by everything from
impenetrable forests and murky ponds to hundreds of false
leads. People have phoned in sightings of hubcaps and
chicken bones. This afternoon, one boy raced up to a debris
team claiming he had something that fell from the sky. It
was a Chevy alternator. 

There have also been thieves. NASA officials said more than
500 shards of wreckage have been plundered from unguarded
sites. 

Mary Ann Rector, who lives in Melrose, a town in East Texas
that escapes the biggest of maps, said "some guy with a
gun" came by her home and took away a charred camera her
family had found in the woods. The real NASA officials came later. 
"Now we don't know
where it is," Ms. Rector said. 

Among the more significant discoveries today: a piece of
landing gear recovered near the Louisiana border; a cockpit
seat; a six-foot section of a wing found in a pond; several
tanks still full of fuel, somehow, after slamming to the
ground from 200,000 feet; and computer circuit boards that
might hold some clues to why the shuttle broke up over
Texas four days ago, killing all seven astronauts aboard. 
Also found: a patch stitched with the Star of David,
possibly from the sleeve of the Israeli astronaut, Col.
Ilan Ramon. 

The field of debris keeps widening, with reports of thermal
tiles from the shuttle's underbelly spotted in California.
Those reports excited NASA officials, who are eager for any
clues into the moments before the breakup. 

"It's profoundly important because anything from that stage
of the flight could help us piece together what happened,"
said Andy Thomas, NASA's deputy chief astronaut. 

Still, East Texas continues to be the hub of recovery
efforts. This morning, retired Admiral Harold W. Gehman
Jr., chairman of the independent shuttle investigation,
came to Nacogdoches, a town transformed by all the shuttle
pieces that rained down on it. 

Each morning, debris teams of 6 to 10 people meet at the
sheriff's office, where they huddle around a red and white
Salvation Army truck serving Sunny Delight and steaming
cups of coffee. 

They are handed lists of debris sites. Most of the known
debris has been discovered by residents, like the shuttle's
nose cone, which was found on Monday embedded in the ground
in a deep thicket near Hemphill, Tex., by two men out for a
walk. 

Some pieces have been spotted by sheriff's deputies and
other authorities. As the days pass, more resources are
being applied to extensive searches of unpopulated areas. 
In Hemphill, to the east, large numbers of debris searchers
staggered their way today through a landscape of thorns,
swamps, snakes and other critters. 

"You're dealing with head-high or waist-high brush that
will either poke you, trip you, tear you, sting you or make
you itch," said Michael G. Dawson, a search specialist with
the Forest Service. 

When a debris team locates a piece of the space shuttle,
the first thing it does is check for hazardous materials.
The team members stand upwind to do this. 

"Zero rad!" yelled David Kuykendall, an Army sergeant, as
he kneeled next to a crushed thermal tile in a field near
Nacogdoches and waved a radiation-detecting wand. "All
clear!" 

Initially, NASA scientists warned that debris would include
explosive bolts, volatile sealant and highly toxic fuel
tanks. They told people not to touch anything and to stay
away. 

Several of the debris teams include environmental engineers
and soldiers schooled in the science of explosives. They
use radiation meters and photo-ionizers to check for
dangerous material. Of the debris recovered so far, most of
the toxic chemicals and fuels seems to have burned off in
the fiery plunge to earth, Brian Danko, a state
environmental investigator, said. 

An exception was an orb-like tank of fuel mashed into the
mud of a deserted field near Melrose. The size of a
beachball, the orb was intact. 

"I ain't touching that," Sergeant Kuykendall said. NASA
officials could remove it, the team decided. 

The next step is to record the coordinates of the debris
with Global Positioning System meters. NASA scientists are
trying to piece together a map of what debris fell where to
help them understand the sequence of events that led to the
Columbia's break-up. The GPS coordinates also help debris
teams to determine which areas they should go back and
scour, based on the concentration of objects found. 

The last step is removal. Small pieces go in Ziplocs. Big
items, like a blackened circuit board found in Melrose, get
wrapped in thick plastic. Some debris gets scooped up with
a spoon, like the crushed, powdery thermal tiles. 

The procedure changes when human remains are found. Debris
teams are instructed to notify federal authorities
immediately. Many body parts have already been retrieved,
and stored at Barksdale Air Force Base in Western Louisiana
pending transfer to a special military laboratory for
identification. 

"Picking up shards of metal is one thing," Lieutenant
Pearson said. "But the priority is really clear: Find these
astronauts. Of all the stuff we do, you can tell the NASA
folks really want their people back."

North Korea Restarts Plant With Ability to Fuel Arms

February 6, 2003
By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 5 - In a move that appeared
designed to keep pressure on the United States, North Korea
said today that it had resumed "normal operations" at a
mothballed nuclear reactor that could be used to produce
weapons-grade uranium. 

The North said the reactivated plant at Yongbyon would "for
the present stage" be used only to produce electricity -
but the United States says the site could produce nuclear
weapons within months. 

In Washington, President Bush's national security adviser,
Condoleezza Rice, dismissed North Korea's apparent pressure
tactics. "The North Korean regime seems to believe that the
way to get people to engage with it is to try and blackmail
them into it," she said tonight on ABC's "Nightline." "And
what the United States is saying is that blackmail will not
work." 

The North Korean announcement was the latest in a series of
what appeared to be carefully calibrated and deliberate
steps to force Washington to the negotiating table. In
particular, the announced start-up of the reactor seemed
deliberately timed to coincide with the speech to the
United Nations Security Council by Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell. 

For months, North Korea has said that it would meet the
United States concerns over the country's weapons of mass
destruction in exchange for a treaty of nonaggression. The
country appears to be betting that with Washington
preoccupied with Iraq, it is unable or unwilling to mount a
military strike, and will ultimately be forced to talk. 

The Bush administration has insisted that the crisis be
handled through the United Nations and in concert with
North Korea's neighbors. Mr. Bush has said that the United
States has no plans to invade North Korea. But
administration officials have dismissed the idea of a
treaty, steadfastly maintaining that North Korea must
dismantle its nuclear weapons-making infrastructure before
relations can improve. 

The nuclear crisis burst into the open in October, when
senior American diplomats traveled to the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang to confront officials with evidence of
a secret program to produce highly enriched uranium, an
activity that violated multiple commitments by North Korea.

According to American accounts of the meeting, North Korean
officials acknowledged their weapons program. Washington
responded by suspending shipments of fuel oil, which were
provided under a 1994 understanding intended to prevent
North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. 

Since the suspension of fuel deliveries, North Korea has
taken a series of steps that bring it closer to being able
to produce nuclear weapons, seemingly in the hope of
forcing the United States to negotiate a new agreement. 

These moves have included the expulsion of international
inspectors from the Yongbyon complex, the removal of seals
on stored quantities of spent nuclear fuel and most
recently, the loading of nuclear fuel into the mothballed
reactor. 

In the announcement today, North Korea asserted that
electricity production was its only goal. Diplomats
scoffed, however, noting that the reactor was capable of
producing only modest amounts of power.

Radioactive debate heats up
By Casi Marie Herbst
NewsNet Staff Writer
5 Feb 2003

A small amount of class A radioactive waste spilled on its way to Utah two weeks ago,
stirring an already hot debate, in which Utahns are petitioning for a ban on class B and
C radioactive waste.

On Jan. 22, a small amount of radioactive waste spilled on its way from an Oak Ridge,
Tenn., location. The dirt, which was contaminated, leaked from its inner container into
the secondary container. It did not pose any threat to people or the environment.

"At no time was there any risk," said Julie Blake, vice president of marketing for
Envirocare.

Rail transportation of radioactive waste has been halted until the U.S. Energy Department
and Betchel Jacob's Inc. (the company which transported the waste) have inspected the
incident.

Betchel Jacob's assumes the waste leaked somewhere around a rail change in St. Louis
where the lid to one of the cases were jostled and dislodged according to Blake. Betchel
Jacob's had no comment.

Fourteen rail shipments had been completed before this spill took place. Although rail
shipments have ceased for now, truck shipments have continued.

There are many safety requirements that must be met when transporting radioactive waste.
However, some feel waste does not belong in Utah and transportation should be banned. The
Green Party opposes both storage and transportation of nuclear waste.

There are three types of radioactive waste being disposed of in Utah: A, B, and C. Class
A is the lowest level and poses no risk to human health. It decays and is safe within 100
years. Class B posses no risk if it is stabilized before going to a facility. Stabilizing
can include taking out liquids or treating it with a polymer before storage. Class B
decays and is safe after 300 years. Class C must be treated by a facility and is safe
after decomposing for 500 years.

Classes B and C radioactive components can be found in ordinary products such as smoke
detectors, exit signs, ink, plastics, adhesives, and other materials.

Gov. Mike Leavitt has opposed the storage and transportation of radioactive waste since
2000.

Envirocare feels that before transportation of B and C level is banned Utah citizens
should research and understand the costs.

In 50 years of transporting radioactive material Envirocare has never had an accident
that has posed a danger to people or the environment according to Blake

To visit silence
By Natalia A. Feduschak
THE WASHINGTON TIMES

     PRYPIAT, Ukraine -  The changes during the past five years at the Chernobyl nuclear
power station are evident from the rooftop of a 13-story apartment building about a
mile away.

The sarcophagus of its No. 4 reactor, the one that blew in 1986, looks sturdier than
before, thanks to $300 million in upgrades. Plans are under way to permanently
encase the structure to make certain the tiny cracks that developed on the hastily
built original container don't let water in and start chemical reactions inside,
perhaps causing another explosion. Crews from France and Italy work in an adjacent
field that will be the burial ground for the radioactive waste, which cannot be
transported outside Chernobyl's "dead zone," the circle extending nearly 10 miles in
all directions that received the most radioactive fallout. The station's elongated
administration building, site of a freak fire in 1993, is now painted a glaring
white. The meandering Prypiat River that runs alongside the station is finally
showing signs of life -  the occasional tracks of a mouse, hawk or fox on its banks.

Some things, however, haven't changed. The majestic green forest that spreads out
like a delta into neighboring Belarus is deceiving. The forest is contaminated. In
some spots, radiation reaches hundreds of times the normal background level. The
city of Prypiat, abandoned within hours of the 1986 explosion, remains a ghost town.

Walls of a spacious kindergarten are still adorned by pictures drawn in a child's
hand, while crumbling apartment blocks contain stoves, sofas and mattresses.

"Eventually this place will be swallowed by the earth," a guide tells his visitor as
they trample through Prypiat's soccer field, inaugurated days before the accident
and now overgrown with birch trees. "You know what the Bible says: 'Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.' " A Kiev tourist agency offers tours to Chernobyl for people
interested in "extreme eco-tourism." The daylong trip costs $193 for an individual,
less per person for groups. To visit Chernobyl is to visit silence. Ukraine decided
to open the grounds around the station to tourists to teach them about the accident
and to disseminate information about the challenges it faces. "There is so much
misinformation," said Mykola Dmytruk, assistant director of Chernobyl's information
agency, Chernobylinform. "Trips like these are one way of combating it." Tourist
visits don't add much to the station's budget; last year, tours brought in about
$3,000 after costs. Still, visitors are able to see the site and get a good look at
the No. 4 reactor from a safe vantage point. Taking pictures up close isn't allowed
to ensure terrorists can't study the station's security features. Visitors also see
the abandoned town of Prypiat, and, as a Geiger counter clicks rapidly, drive
quickly past areas with elevated levels of radiation to visit the machinery
graveyard. There, helicopters, trucks and cars used in the 1986 evacuation effort
rust away. A private company sells approved vehicles as scrap metal. Only those with
special permission can go inside the station. In addition, visitors can visit with
elderly residents who were evacuated from their homes but returned illegally over
the years to take up gardening and raising pigs for food in the dead zone. The
station's most frequent visitors are scientists, teachers and journalists.

Chernobyl's most pressing problem today is lack of finances, said Mr. Dmytruk, of
Chernobylinform. Since the station closed its last operating reactor two years ago
under international pressure, Ukraine has lost nearly $920,000 a day in energy
exports. In addition, the country has received only a fraction of the nearly $1
billion in aid promised by the international community to offset those losses and
finish building two other Ukrainian nuclear power stations, Mr. Dmytruk said.

"Because of that," he said, there is a strong feeling here the station should be
restarted. "We all know that won't happen; it would be politically inappropriate.

But there is disillusionment with the West." Although foreign donors have been
diligent in ensuring that a permanent structure is built over the No. 4 reactor's
sarcophagus, Mr. Dmytruk and his colleagues are more worried about the area around
the station. The contaminated forests are prone to fires in dry seasons, which could
send their radiation to points farther west, but there is scant money for upkeep.

Water from the Prypiat River flows into the Dnipro River and then into the Black
Sea. A major challenge has been to ensure that radioactivity from the station
doesn't wander south. There are other pressing issues: re-educating workers who will
lose their jobs as the station shuts down, monitoring the health of the those
working at Chernobyl and paying the electric bill. "Just because you shut the
station down doesn't mean it stops functioning," Mr. Dmytruk said. "It is a living
organism." Recently, the Kiev-based company that provides electricity to Chernobyl - 
one of its partners is an American -  threatened to cut off energy because of debt.

That is troubling, Mr. Dmytruk said, because even though the station doesn't
generate electricity, the nuclear reactors have to be cooled. "Can you imagine
cutting electricity to a nuclear power station?" he asked. Though the Ukrainian
government annually budgets funds for Chernobyl, the station has been getting less
and less money. The situation has become so critical that Ukraine's new prime
minister, Victor Yanukovych, made an emergency visit to the station to meet with
directors shortly after taking office. He promised more money. Such promises mean
little to the guards who man the security checkpoint on the road leading to the
village of Paryshiv, which is home to 36 persons, mostly widows, who returned to
their homes after being evacuated by Soviet authorities immediately after the
disaster. On a recent evening, the guards manning the checkpoint sat in a dark
booth. Later, one of them, who did not want to be named, acknowledged that he and
his colleagues had been without electricity for five days. That doesn't keep the
wolves at bay, he joked. Mikhail and Maria Urypa come out their front gate to greet
another visitor from abroad. They've been married for 46 years and have been through
this before. In the past week they had answered questions from correspondents from
HBO and a Brazilian reporter about why they decided to return to their home days
after the Chernobyl accident. The childhood sweethearts made clear why they refused
to leave: Chernobyl is their birthright. They may live in a ghost town, but at least
they will be buried next to their ancestors. The Urypa homestead is simple: a house,
a barn, a summer kitchen. What concerns Mrs. Urypa most now is how she will get milk
now that her oldest cow has died. "It's gotten bad in the last two months," she said
as her husband insisted on entertaining his reluctant guests with home brew.

"Usually the authorities would come here to pay our pensions, bring groceries by
truck and take us into town so we could buy clothes and other things. But they have
stopped coming. I can't live without milk." Mrs. Urypa operates the only ham radio
in town, the lifeline of residents to the outside world. If someone gets sick, Mrs.
Urypa calls Chernobyl authorities. If someone disappears, as one elderly neighbor
did not long ago, she calls authorities. "Come visit us again," Mrs. Urypa said, as
she posed for a photo with her new, year-old heifer. The consequences for Ukraine of
the Chernobyl nuclear disaster will remain for generations. Although only a few
dozen exposed people died soon after the accident, tens of thousands of cancer
deaths are expected, Ukrainian doctors said. "We are only now beginning to see the
after effects," said Yevgheniya Stepanova, a physician from Ukraine's Academy of
Medical Sciences who has been studying children affected by the Chernobyl accident.

Children born during or shortly after the explosion will soon have children of their
own. "Only then will we have a better idea of the long-term effects of radiation,"
she said. Meanwhile, in the most contaminated regions of the country, an alarming
number of babies with Down syndrome are being born to young women.

Iran Says It Has Developed Ability to Fuel Nuclear Plants but Won't Seek Weapons
February 10, 2003
By NAZILA FATHI 

TEHRAN, Feb. 9 - President Mohammad Khatami said today that
Iran was determined to develop nuclear technology, but he
reiterated that it would be for peaceful purposes. 

"I assure all peace-loving individuals in the world that
Iran's efforts in the field of nuclear technology are
focused on civilian application and nothing else," Mr.
Khatami said during a meeting with Mostafa Moin, the
minister of research, science and technology, and with
university professors, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported. "This is the legitimate right of Iranian people."

The United States has put increasing pressure on Iran over
the issue, accusing Iran of trying to develop nuclear
weapons. 

Mr. Khatami said Iran had begun mining uranium near the
city of Yazd, in central Iran, and that the country had
acquired the knowledge to prepare the ore for use in
civilian power plants. 

He added that Iran was planning to build two plants - in
the cities of Isfahan, in central Iran, and Kashan, south
of Tehran - for processing the uranium to provide fuel for
generating electricity. 

Russia has helped Iran to complete a 1,000 megawatt nuclear
power plant in the southern city of Bushehr, which is
expected to begin operating by the end of 2003. 

The United States has raised concerns about the Bushehr
power plant and about newly disclosed plans for two other
nuclear plants. 

An Iranian dissident group, the National Council of
Resistance of Iran, said in August that it had learned from
sources within Iran about two secret nuclear sites under
construction. One, about 25 miles southeast of the city of
Kashan, was to be used for nuclear fuel production, the
council said. It said the site included two large spaces
that are 25 feet underground. A facility meant to produce
heavy water was along a river near the central city of
Arak, the council said. 

Iran has large oil and gas reserves, and the United States
argues that Iran has no need to develop nuclear energy. 

However, Iran has rejected claims that it is trying to
acquire weapons of mass destruction. It contends that
nuclear plants are needed to help increase its electricity
generation by 6,000 megawatts over the next 20 years. 

The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in
a written answer to a question at a Friday news briefing
that the United States believed that "Iran uses Bushehr as
a cover and a pretext for obtaining sensitive technologies
to advance its nuclear weapons program." 

"The recent revelations that Iran has been secretly
constructing nuclear-related facilities capable of
producing fissile material not needed for Iran's `peaceful'
nuclear energy needs, is but one example of the sustained
effort by Iran to cloak the true activities and intentions
of its nuclear program," he said. 

A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, denied the
accusations and said that Iran's nuclear activities were
carried out under the supervision of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that monitors
nuclear facilities. 

"In spreading their poisonous and disdainful rumors, the
United States is trying to militarize international
relations to serve its political and economic interests,"
he said. 

The European Union, in talks aimed at strengthening
economic ties with Iran, has also put pressure on Iran to
sign the energy agency's additional protocol to expand
inspections in the country and to require more rigorous
declaration of nuclear-related activities. 

Chris Patten, the European Union's commissioner for
external relations, said last week during a visit to Tehran
that Iran was still seeking to acquire nonconventional
weapons. He said that openness was vital for arms control. 

Although Iran has signed the international treaty on
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, signing "the
International Atomic Energy Agency additional protocol
would send a most positive message, setting a regional lead
and underlining serious international commitment," he said.

Mr. Khatami emphasized that Iran had cooperated with the
International Atomic Energy Agency and "welcomed
international supervision to dispel the lies being
fabricated against Iran." 

The director general of the atomic energy agency, Mohamed
ElBaradei, is expected to visit Iran on Feb. 25 to inspect
sites to make sure they are part of the "civilian fuel
cycle."

Waste Disposal Site

Stephen Romano, President and Chief Executive Officer of American Ecology 
Corporation (Nasdaq:ECOL), today announced the sale of the Company's El 
Centro municipal and industrial waste landfill located near Corpus Christi, 
Texas, to a subsidiary of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. ("Allied") for $10 
million cash at closing and future volume-based royalty payments.

"Monetizing this non-core asset provides capital for continued expansion of 
our core hazardous, industrial and radioactive waste disposal business and 
allows us the opportunity to improve our capital structure," Romano stated.

"Allied is well positioned to grow El Centro revenue and earnings through 
integration with its substantial existing municipal waste collection 
operation, so this is a good deal for both companies," Romano added.

Under the Agreement, the purchase agreement also provides incentives for 
Allied to bring certain industrial waste to the Texas Ecologists hazardous 
waste facility, and for the Company to utilize the El Centro landfill.

Opened in July 2000, the El Centro solid waste landfill was carried on the 
Company's books at approximately $7 million prior to sale. When combined with 
a reduction in liabilities and recognition of certain future minimum 
royalties, the sale should result in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately 
$5 million to be recognized during the first quarter of 2003.

"While we are no longer in the municipal waste business, the Company will 
remain an active member of the local community through our Texas Ecologists 
hazardous waste facility," Romano noted, concluding "We look forward to 
focusing future efforts on growth of our core business."

Three Mile Island draws no buyers after five months

2/18/2003 HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - More than five months after the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant was put for sale, it still doesn't have any buyers.

Exelon Energy of Chicago had been expected to announce a buyer by Jan. 31.
Exelon and British Energy of Edinburgh, Scotland, own the plant in a joint
venture called AmerGen.

British Energy is debt-laden and must liquidate its North American nuclear
holdings by June 30. On the market along with Three Mile Island are AmerGen
facilities in Oyster Creek, N.J., and Clinton, Ill.

It is not known whether Exelon is angling to buy British Energy's half of
AmerGen.

Exelon officials have been mum on the deal.

"No decision has been made," said Dave Simon, an Exelon spokesman in
Philadelphia. "We can't talk about anything until something happens."

In Chicago, company spokesman Don Kirchoffner also declined to elaborate.

AmerGen bought Three Mile Island from GPU Nuclear in 1999 for $100 million.

The Three Mile Island plant, 10 miles south of Harrisburg, was the site of
the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. In 1979, overheating of the
Unit 2 reactor caused a partial nuclear meltdown and a low-level release of
radiation.

RUSSIA

Nuclear fuel taken off sub

MOSCOW -- Russian workers finished unloading nuclear fuel from a reactor in
the ruined Kursk nuclear submarine, according to a news report. Officials
said the Nerpa shipyard will begin preparing the destroyed vessel for its
transportation to a temporary storage site in the Barents Sea.

GEORGIA

Cesium-137 boxes missing

TBILISI -- Three small containers containing radioactive cesium-137 are
missing from a Georgian military base, officials confirmed. The substance,
which cannot be used to make a nuclear weapon, disappeared in December.

TBILISI, GEORGIA: 
Radioactive materials vanish, could be used for 'dirty bomb'

The Associated Press

Three small containers containing radioactive materials are missing from a
Georgian military base, officials confirmed Monday.

The containers of cesium-137 disappeared in December from the Vaziani
military base in this former Soviet republic, said military prosecutor Mamuk
Tsaav.

Georgian officials did not say how much of the material was stolen or
whether it was high-grade. Cesium-137 is often cited as one of the most
likely substances that could be used in a so-called "dirty bomb," in which a
conventional explosive device spreads radioactive material.

Fortress America

February 23, 2003
By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI 

In the last several weeks, as preparations for the war
against Iraq have heated up, it has begun to sink in that
this will be a different conflict from what we have seen
before -- that there may, in fact, be two fronts, one far
away on the ground in the Middle East, the other right here
at home. For the first time in history, it seems plausible
that an enemy might mount a sustained attack on the United
States, using weapons of terrorism. The term "soft
targets," which refers to everyday places like offices,
shopping malls, restaurants and hotels, is now casually
dropped into conversation, the way military planners talk
about "collateral damage." 

Earlier this month, the federal government raised the
official terrorism alert level and advised Americans to
prepare a "disaster supply kit," including duct tape to
seal windows against airborne toxins. Members of Congress
organized news conferences to demand that passenger jets be
outfitted with missile-avoidance systems. In major public
areas of cities, the police presence has been especially
conspicuous, with weapons ostentatiously displayed.
Whatever the details, the message was the same: war is on
the way here. 

The impossible questions begin with where, what and how,
and end with what to do about it. Sgt. George McClaskey, a
Baltimore cop, spends his days thinking about the answers,
and one cold day recently, he took me out in an old police
launch to survey Baltimore harbor. He showed me some of the
new security measures, like the barriers at the approach to
the harbor, which rose out of the water like stakes in a
moat. Cables were suspended between these reinforced
pylons, designed to slice into approaching high-speed craft
and decapitate would-be suicide bombers before they reached
their mark. It looked fairly daunting. 

Then McClaskey maneuvered the boat toward an unprotected
stretch of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. With the temperature
dipping into the teens, the place was empty. But when the
weather is warm, up to a quarter of a million people
congregate on these piers and brightly painted promenades
every weekend. 

"If I wanted to create a big bang," McClaskey said,
adopting the mind-set of a suicide bomber, "I'd pack a
small boat with explosives and crash it right there." He
pointed to a promenade. "It'd be a catastrophe," he
declared. "It would take 48 hours just for the tide to
flush out the bodies from under the boardwalk." 

The port is lined with large oil terminals, storage tanks
and petrochemical facilities, incendiaries in need only of
a lighted fuse. Even the Domino sugar refinery, with its
sticky-sweet flammable dust, poses a threat. "Most people
don't think about it," McClaskey said, "but that's a
giant bomb." 

The list of vulnerabilities is perilously long in
Baltimore, as it is just about everywhere in the United
States. And every one of those potential targets can set in
motion an ever-broadening ripple effect. Should terrorists
manage to blow up an oil terminal in Baltimore, for
instance, the nearby ventilation systems for the I-95
tunnel would have to be shut. Shut down the tunnel, and the
Interstate highway must be closed. Close down a section of
I-95, and traffic along the entire Eastern Seaboard snarls
to a halt. 

"So how would you defend against frogmen blowing up half
the harbor?" I asked McClaskey. 

The sergeant shrugged uneasily. "Honestly," he confessed,
"I don't think it's possible." Like most law enforcement
officers in this country, McClaskey has been trained to
catch crooks, not to stop submerged suicide bombers.
Imagining doomsday possibilities is one thing; we've all
become good at it these past 18 months. Coming up with
counterterror solutions is another story, often beyond the
scope of our imaginations. But while that expertise may not
yet exist in the United States, it's out there, if you know
where to look. 

"Sonar," replied Rear Adm. Amiram Rafael, when I put the
same question to him 6,000 miles away in Israel, perhaps
the one place in the world where terrorism is as much a
part of daily life as commuter traffic. "It can
distinguish between humans and large fish by mapping
movement patterns and speed." Rafael spent 28 years
protecting Israel's coastline from terrorists and now
consults for foreign clients. "If the alarm sounds, rapid
response units in fast boats are dispatched," he said.
"They're equipped with underwater concussion grenades." 

"To stun the divers?" I asked. 

"No," Rafael said,
flashing a fatherly smile. "To kill them." 

Until recently, the United States and countries like Israel
occupied opposite ends of the security spectrum: one a
confident and carefree superpower, seemingly untouchable,
the other a tiny garrison state, surrounded by
fortifications and barbed wire, fighting for its survival.
But the security gap between the U.S. and places like
Israel is narrowing. Subways, sewers, shopping centers,
food processing and water systems are all now seen as easy
prey for terrorists. 

There is no clear consensus yet on how to go about
protecting ourselves. The federal government recently
concluded a 16-month risk assessment, and last month, the
new Department of Homeland Security was officially born,
with an annual budget of $36 billion. Big money has already
been allocated to shore up certain perceived weaknesses,
including the $5.8 billion spent hiring, training and
equipping federal airport screeners and the $3 billion
allocated for "bioterrorism preparedness." All that has
been well publicized. Other measures, like sophisticated
radiation sensors and surveillance systems, have been
installed in some cities with less fanfare. Meanwhile, the
F.B.I. is carrying out labor-intensive tasks that would
have seemed a ludicrous waste of time 18 months ago, like
assembling dossiers on people who take scuba-diving
courses. 

This marks only the very beginning. A national conversation
is starting about what kind of country we want to live in
and what balance we will tolerate between public safety and
private freedom. The decisions won't come all at once, and
we may be changing our minds a lot, depending on whether
there are more attacks here, what our government tells us
and what we believe. Two weeks ago, Congress decided to
sharply curtail the activities of the Total Information
Awareness program, a Pentagon project led by Rear Adm. John
Poindexter and invested with power to electronically sift
through the private affairs of American citizens. For the
time being, it was felt that the threat of having the
government look over our credit-card statements and medical
records was more dangerous than its promised benefits. 

Congress didn't completely shut the door on the T.I.A.,
though. Agents can still look into the lives of foreigners,
and its functions could be expanded at any time. We could,
for instance, reach the point where we demand the
installation of systems, like the one along the Israeli
coastline, to maim or kill intruders in certain sensitive
areas before they have a chance to explain who they are or
why they're there. We may come to think nothing of American
citizens who act suspiciously being held without bail or
denied legal representation for indeterminate periods or
tried in courts whose proceedings are under seal. At
shopping malls and restaurants, we may prefer to encounter
heavily armed guards and be subjected to routine searches
at the door. We may be willing to give up the freedom and
ease of movement that has defined American life, if we come
to believe our safety depends upon it. 

For the better part of a generation now, Americans have
gone to great lengths to protect their homes -- living in
gated communities, wiring their property with sophisticated
alarms, arming themselves with deadly weapons. Now imagine
this kind of intensity turned outward, into the public
realm. As a culture, our tolerance for fear is low, and our
capacity to do something about it is unrivaled. We could
have the highest degree of public safety the world has ever
seen. But what would that country look like, and what will
it be like to live in it? Perhaps something like this. 

Electronic Frisking Every Day on Your Commute 

As a
homebound commuter entering Washington's Foggy Bottom
subway station swipes his fare card through the turnstile
reader, a computer in the bowels of the mass transit
authority takes note. A suspicious pattern of movements has
triggered the computer's curiosity. 

The giveaway is a microchip in the new digital fare cards,
derived from the electronic ID cards many of us already use
to enter our workplaces. It could be in use throughout the
U.S. within a couple of years. If embedded with the user's
driver's license or national ID number, it would allow
transportation authorities to keep tabs on who rides the
subway, and on when and where they get on and off. 

The commuter steps through the turnstile and is scanned by
the radiation portal. These would be a natural extension of
the hand-held detectors that the police have started using
in the New York subways. A cancer patient was actually
strip-searched in a New York subway station in 2002 after
residue from radiation treatments tripped the meters. But
this doesn't happen to our fictitious commuter. The meters
barely flicker, registering less than one on a scale of one
to nine, the equivalent of a few microroentgens an hour,
nowhere near the 3,800 readout that triggers evacuation
sirens. 

Imagine a battery of video cameras following the commuter's
progress to the platform, where he reads a newspaper,
standing next to an old utility room that contains gas
masks. Cops in New York already have them as part of their
standard-issue gear, and a fully secure subway system would
need them for everybody, just as every ferryboat must have
a life preserver for every passenger. Sensors, which are
already used in parts of the New York subway system, would
test the air around him for the presence of chemical agents
like sarin and mustard gases. 

The commuter finishes reading his newspaper, but there is
no place to throw it away because all trash cans have been
removed, as they were in London when the I.R.A. used them
to plant bombs. Cameras show the commuter boarding one of
the subway cars, which have been reconfigured to drop
oxygen masks from the ceiling in the event of a chemical
attack, much like jetliners during decompression. The added
security measures have probably pushed fares up throughout
the country, maybe as much as 40 percent in some places. 

The commuter -- now the surveillance subject -- gets off at
the next stop. As he rides the escalator up, a camera
positioned overhead zooms in for a close-up of him. This
image, which will be used to confirm his identity, travels
through fiber-optic cables to the Joint Operations Command
Center at police headquarters. There, a computer scans his
facial features, breaks them down into three-dimensional
plots and compares them with a databank of criminal mug
shots, people on watch lists and anyone who has ever posed
for a government-issue ID. The facial-recognition program
was originally developed at M.I.T. Used before 9/11 mainly
by casinos to ferret out known cardsharps, the system has
been tried by airport and law enforcement authorities and
costs $75,000 to $100,000 per tower, as the camera stations
are called. 

"It can be used at A.T.M.'s, car-rental agencies, D.M.V.
offices, border crossings," says an executive of Viisage
Technology, maker of the Face-Finder recognition system.
"These are the sorts of facilities the 19 hijackers
used." 

Almost instantly, the software verifies the subject's
identity and forwards the information to federal
authorities. What they do with it depends on the powers of
the Total Information Awareness program or whatever its
successors will be known as. But let's say that Congress
has granted the government authority to note certain
suspicious patterns, like when someone buys an airline
ticket with cash and leaves the return date open. And let's
say the commuter did just that -- his credit cards were
maxed out, so he had no choice. And he didn't fill in a
return date because he wasn't sure when his next consulting
assignment was going to start, and he thought he might be
able to extend his vacation a few days. 

On top of that, let's say he was also indiscreet in an
e-mail message, making a crude joke to a client about a
recent airline crash. Software programs that scan for
suspect words are not new. Corporations have long used them
to automatically block employee e-mail containing, for
instance, multiple references to sex. The National Security
Agency's global spy satellites and supercomputers have for
years taken the search capability to the next level,
processing the content of up to two million calls and
e-mail messages per hour around the world. 

Turning the snooping technology on Americans would not be
difficult, if political circumstances made it seem
necessary. Right now, there would be fierce resistance to
this, but the debate could swing radically to the other
side if the government showed that intercepting e-mail
could deter terrorists from communicating with one another.
Already, says Barry Steinhardt, director of the A.C.L.U.
program on technology and liberty, authorities have been
demanding records from Internet providers and public
libraries about what books people are taking out and what
Web sites they're looking at. 

Once the commuter is on the government's radar screen, it
would be hard for him to get off -- as anyone who has ever
found themselves on a mailing or telemarketers' list can
attest. It will be like when you refinance a mortgage --
suddenly every financial institution in America sends you a
preapproved platinum card. Once a computer detects a
pattern, hidden or overt, your identity in the digital
world is fixed. 

Technicians manning the Command Center probably wouldn't
know why the subject is on a surveillance list, or whether
he should even be on it in the first place. That would be
classified, as most aspects of the government's
counterterrorist calculations are. 

Nonetheless, they begin to monitor his movements. Cameras
on K Street pick him up as he exits the subway station and
hails a waiting taxi. The cab's license plate number, as a
matter of routine procedure, is run through another
software program -- first used in Peru in the 1990's to
detect vehicles that have been stolen or registered to
terrorist sympathizers, and most recently introduced in
central London to nab motorists who have not paid peak-hour
traffic tariffs. Technicians get another positive reading;
the cabdriver is also on a watch list. He is a Pakistani
immigrant and has traveled back and forth to Karachi twice
in the last six months, once when his father died, the
other to attend his brother's wedding. These trips seem
harmless, but the trackers are trained not to make these
sorts of distinctions. 

So what they see is the possible beginning of a terrorist
conspiracy -- one slightly suspicious character has just
crossed paths with another slightly suspicious character,
and that makes them seriously suspicious. At this moment,
the case is forwarded to the new National
Counterintelligence Service, which will pay very close
attention to whatever both men do next. 

The N.C.S. does not exist yet, but its creation is
advocated by the likes of Lt. Gen. William Odom, a former
head of the National Security Agency. Whether modeled after
Britain's MI5, a domestic spy agency, or Israel's much more
proactive and unrestricted Shin Bet, the N.C.S. would most
likely require a budget similar to the F.B.I.'s $4.2
billion and nearly as much personnel as the bureau's
11,400-strong special agent force, mostly for surveillance
duties. 

N.C.S. surveillance agents dispatched to tail the two
subjects in the taxi would have little difficulty following
their quarry through Georgetown, up Wisconsin Avenue and
into Woodley Park. One tool at their disposal could be a
nationwide vehicle tracking system, adapted from the
technology used by Singapore's Land Transport Authority to
regulate traffic and parking. The system works on the same
principle as the E-ZPass toll-road technology, in which
scanners at tollbooths read signals from transponders
installed on the windshields of passing vehicles to pay
tolls automatically. In a future application, electronic
readers installed throughout major American metropolitan
centers could pinpoint the location of just about any
vehicle equipped with mandatory transponders. (American
motorists would most likely each have to pay an extra $90
fee, similar to what Singapore charges.) 

When the commuter arrives home, N.C.S. agents arrange to
put his house under 24-hour aerial surveillance. The same
thing happens to the cabdriver when he arrives home. The
technology, discreet and effective, is already deployed in
Washington. Modified UH-60A Blackhawk helicopters, the kind
U.S. Customs uses to intercept drug runners, now patrol the
skies over the capital to enforce no-fly zones. The
Pentagon deployed its ultrasophisticated RC-7
reconnaissance planes during the sniper siege last fall.
The surveillance craft, which have proved their worth along
the DMZ in North Korea and against cocaine barons in
Colombia, come loaded with long-range night-vision and
infrared sensors that permit operators to detect move-ment
and snap photos of virtually anyone's backyard from as far
as 20 miles away. 

A Government That Knows When You've Been Bad or Good 

In
the here and now, an aerial photo of my backyard is on file
at the Joint Operations Command Center in Washington,
which, unlike the N.C.S., already exists. The center looks
like NASA, starting with the biometric palm-print scanners
on its reinforced doors. 

The center has not singled me out for any special
surveillance. My neighbors' houses are all pictured, too,
as are still shots and even three-dimensional images of
just about every building, landmark and lot in central D.C.

The technology isn't revolutionary. How many times a day is
the average American already on camera? There's one in the
corner deli where I get my morning coffee and bagel.
Another one at the A.T.M. outside. Yet another one films
traffic on Connecticut Avenue when I drive my wife to work.
The lobby of her office building has several. So that's at
least four, and it's only 9 a.m. 

There are few legal restraints governing video
surveillance. It is perfectly legal for the government to
track anyone, anywhere, using cameras except for inside his
own home, where a warrant is needed to use thermal imaging
that can see all the way into the basement. Backyards or
rooftops, however, are fair game. 

There is a growing network of video cameras positioned
throughout the capital that feed into the Joint Operations
Command Center, otherwise known as the JOCC, which has been
operational since 9/11. The experimental facility is shared
by several government agencies, including the Metropolitan
Police Department, the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the
State Department and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Agents from different law enforcement bodies man the JOCC's
36 computer terminals, which are arrayed in long rows
beneath wall-size projection screens, like the Houston
space center. The wall screens simultaneously display live
feeds, digital simulations, city maps with the locations of
recently released felons and gory crime scene footage. 

"From here we can tap into schools, subways, landmarks and
main streets," says Chief Charles Ramsey of the D.C.
Police, with evident pride. Theoretically, with a few
clicks of the mouse the system could also link up with
thousands of closed-circuit cameras in shopping malls,
department stores and office buildings, and is programmed
to handle live feeds from up to six helicopters
simultaneously. Ramsey is careful to add that, for now, the
majority of the cameras are off-line most of the time, and
that the police aren't using them to look into elevators or
to spy on individuals. 

But they could if they wanted to. I ask for a demonstration
of the system's capabilities. A technician punches in a few
keystrokes. An aerial photo of the city shot earlier from a
surveillance plane flashes on one of the big screens. "Can
you zoom in on Dupont Circle?" I ask. The screen flickers,
and the thoroughfare's round fountain comes into view. "Go
up Connecticut Avenue." The outline of the Hilton Hotel
where President Reagan was shot materializes. "Up a few
more blocks, and toward Rock Creek Park," I instruct.
"There, can you get any closer?" The image blurs and
focuses, and I can suddenly see the air-conditioning unit
on my roof, my garden furniture and the cypress hedge I
recently planted in my yard. 

The fact that government officials can, from a remote
location, snoop into the backyards of most Washingtonians
opens up a whole new level of information they can find out
about us almost effortlessly. They could keep track of when
you come and go from your house, discovering in the process
that you work a second job or that you are carrying on an
extramarital affair. Under normal circumstances, there's
not much they could do with this information. And for the
time being, that is the way most Americans want it. But
this is the kind of issue that will come up over the next
few years. How many extra tools will we be willing to grant
to the police and federal authorities? How much will we
allow our notions of privacy to narrow? 

Because if domestic intelligence agents were able to find
out secret details of people's lives, they could get the
cooperation of crucial witnesses who might otherwise be
inclined to keep quiet. There is more than a whiff of
McCarthyism to all this, but perhaps we will be afraid
enough to endure it. 

The JOCC is also studying the effect of large-scale bombs
in Washington. A three-dimensional map of all downtown
buildings allows technicians to simulate bomb blasts and
debris projections. They can also tap into the weather
bureau for real-time data on wind speeds and directions to
determine which parts of the city would have to be
evacuated first in the event of a radiological or
biochemical plume. Programmers are now working on an
underground map of the capital that would show water and
gas distribution and power grids. 

Efforts are under way to establish facilities similar to
the JOCC in big urban centers like Los Angeles, Chicago,
Atlanta and New York. One benefit of the JOCC's is that
they are relatively cheap to set up, particularly since
most major cities already have surveillance equipment
positioned in places like tunnels and bridges. Each command
center would likely cost around $7 million to build, with
an additional $15,000 charge for every camera installed. 

There is also talk of connecting all the facilities
together so that officials in different parts of the
country could coordinate response efforts to terrorism.
"Attacks will likely occur in different cities
simultaneously," Chief Ramsey says. And as for those civil
libertarians uneasy with the notion of blanket national
surveillance, Ramsey just shrugs. "We can't pretend we
live in the 19th century. We have to take advantage of
technology." 

The Mall Guard Who Carries a Machine Gun 

Imagine a wintry scene: snowdrifts and dirty slush and a
long line of people muffled against the cold. This is a
line to get into the mall, and it is moving frustratingly
slowly. What's the holdup? There is no new blockbuster
movie opening that day, or any of those "everything must
go" clearance sales that might justify standing outside
freezing for 20 minutes. Customers are simply waiting to
clear security. 

Shopping in an environment of total terrorist preparedness
promises to be a vastly different experience from anything
ever imagined in America. But for millions of people who
live in terror-prone places like Israel or the Philippines,
tight security at shopping malls has long been a fact of
life. "I was shocked when I first came to the States and
could go into any shopping plaza without going through
security," says Aviv Tene, a 33-year-old Haifa attorney.
"It seemed so strange, and risky." 

It took me just under eight minutes to clear the security
checkpoint outside the Dizengoff Center in downtown Tel
Aviv. But that was on a rainy weekday morning before the
food courts and multiplex theater had opened. 

The future shopping experience will start at the
parking-lot entrance. Booths manned by guards will control
access to and from lots to prevent terrorists from
emulating the Washington sniper and using parking lots as
shooting galleries. Cars entering underground garages will
have their trunks searched for explosives, as is the
practice in Manila. It has also become common outside New
York City hotels. This will guard against car or truck
bombs of the type that blew up beneath the World Trade
Center in 1993. 

No one will be able to drive closer than a hundred yards to
mall entrances. Concrete Jersey barriers will stop anyone
from crashing a vehicle into the buildings -- a favored
terrorist tactic for American targets overseas -- or into
the crowds of customers lining up. Screening will follow
the Israeli model: metal barricades will funnel shoppers
through checkpoints at all doors. They will be frisked, and
both they and their bags will be searched and run through
metal detectors. Security would be tightest in winter, says
a former senior F.B.I. agent, because AK-47's and grenade
belts are easily concealed beneath heavy coats. 

What won't be concealed, of course, are the weapons carried
by the police at the mall. Major shopping areas will not be
patrolled by the docile, paid-by-the-hour guards to whom
we're accustomed, but -- like airports and New York City
tourist attractions -- by uniformed cops and soldiers with
rifles. 

What will it be like to encounter such firearms on a
regular basis? I lived for years in Moscow, and after a
short time, I rarely noticed the guns. In fact, I tended to
feel more uncomfortable when armed guards were not around;
Israelis traveling in the United States occasionally say
the same thing. But despite the powerful presence of guns
in popular culture, few Americans have had much contact
with the kind of heavy weapons that are now becoming a
common sight on city streets. Such prominent displays are
meant to convey the notion that the government is doing
something to ward off terrorists, but they can have the
reverse effect too, of constantly reminding us of imminent
danger. 

Even more mundane procedures might have the same effect --
for example, being asked to produce a national
identification card every time you go into a store, much
the same way clubgoers have to prove they are of age. The
idea of a national identity card, once widely viewed as
un-American, is gaining ground in Washington, where some
are advocating standardizing driver's licenses throughout
the country as a first step in that direction. Though
perhaps reminiscent of Big Brother, these cards are not
uncommon in the rest of the world, even in Western Europe.
In Singapore, the police frequently ask people to produce
their papers; it becomes so routine that people cease being
bothered by it. How long would it take Americans to become
similarly inured? 

The new ID's, which are advocated by computer industry
leaders like Larry Ellison of Oracle, could resemble the
digital smart cards that Chinese authorities plan to
introduce in Hong Kong by the end of the year. These
contain computer chips with room to store biographical,
financial and medical histories, and tamper-proof
algorithms of the cardholder's thumbprint that can be
verified by hand-held optical readers. Based on the $394
million Hong Kong has budgeted for smart cards for its 6.8
million residents, a similar program in the U.S. could run
as high as $16 billion. 

Among other things, a national identity card program would
make it much harder for people without proper ID to move
around and therefore much easier for police and
domestic-intelligence agents to track them down. And once
found, such people might discover they don't quite have the
rights they thought they had. Even now, for instance, U.S.
citizens can be declared "enemy combatants" and be
detained without counsel. Within a few years, America's
counterterrorist agencies could have the kind of sweeping
powers of arrest and interrogation that have developed in
places like Israel, the Philippines and even France, where
the constant threat of terrorism enabled governments to do
virtually whatever it takes to prevent terrorism. "As long
as you worry too much about making false arrests and don't
start taking greater risks," says Offer Einav, a 15-year
Shin Bet veteran who now runs a security consulting firm,
"you are never going to beat terrorism." 

In years past, the U.S. has had to rely on other
governments to take these risks. For example, the
mastermind of the 1993 W.T.C. bombing, Ramzi Yousef, was
caught only after Philippine investigators used what
official intelligence documents delicately refer to as
"tactical interrogation" to elicit a confession from an
accomplice arrested in Manila. In U.S. court testimony, the
accomplice, Abdul Hakim Murad, later testified that he was
beaten to within an inch of his life. 

In Israel, it is touted that 90 percent of suicide bombers
are caught before they get near their targets, a record
achieved partly because the Shin Bet can do almost anything
it deems necessary to save lives. "They do things we would
not be comfortable with in this country," says former
Assistant F.B.I. Director Steve Pomerantz, who, along with
a growing number of U.S. officials, has traveled to Israel
recently for antiterror training seminars. 

But the U.S. is moving in the Israeli direction. The U.S.A.
Patriot Act, rushed into law six weeks after 9/11, has
given government agencies wide latitude to invoke the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and get around
judicial restraints on search, seizure and surveillance of
American citizens. FISA, originally intended to hunt
international spies, permits the authorities to wiretap
virtually at will and break into people's homes to plant
bugs or copy documents. Last year, surveillance requests by
the federal government under FISA outnumbered for the first
time in U.S. history all of those under domestic law. 

New legislative proposals by the Justice Department now
seek to take the Patriot Act's antiterror powers several
steps further, including the right to strip terror suspects
of their U.S. citizenship. Under the new bill -- titled the
Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 -- the government
would not be required to disclose the identity of anyone
detained in connection with a terror investigation, and the
names of those arrested, be they Americans or foreign
nationals, would be exempt from the Freedom of Information
Act, according to the Center for Public Integrity, a rights
group in Washington, which has obtained a draft of the
bill. An American citizen suspected of being part of a
terrorist conspiracy could be held by investigators without
anyone being notified. He could simply disappear. 

The Face-to-Face Interrogation on Your Vacation 

Some
aspects of life would, in superficial ways, seem easier,
depending on who you are and what sort of specialized ID
you carry. Boarding an international flight, for example,
might not require a passport for frequent fliers. At
Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, "trusted" travelers --
those who have submitted to background checks -- are issued
a smart card encoded with the pattern of their iris. When
they want to pass through security, a scanner checks their
eyes and verifies their identities, and they are off. The
whole process takes 20 seconds, according to Dutch
officials. At Ben-Gurion in Israel, the same basic function
is carried out by electronic palm readers. 

"We start building dossiers the moment someone buys a
ticket," says Einav, the Shin Bet veteran who also once
served as head of El Al security. "We have quite a bit of
information on our frequent fliers. So we know they are not
a security risk." 

The technology frees up security personnel to focus their
efforts on everybody else, who, on my recent trip to
Jerusalem, included me. As a holder of a Canadian passport
(a favorite of forgers) that has visa stamps from a number
of high-risk countries ending in "stan," I was subjected
to a 40-minute interrogation. My clothes and belongings
were swabbed for explosives residue. Taken to a separate
room, I was questioned about every detail of my stay in
Israel, often twice to make certain my story stayed
consistent. Whom did you meet? Where did you meet? What was
the address? Do you have the business cards of the people
you met? Can we see them? What did you discuss? Can we see
your notes? Do you have any maps with you? Did you take any
photographs while you were in Israel? Are you sure? Did you
rent a car? Where did you drive to? Do you have a copy of
your hotel bill? Why do you have a visa to Pakistan? Why do
you live in Washington? Can we see your D.C. driver's
license? Where did you live before Washington? Why did you
live in Moscow? Are you always this nervous? 

A Russian speaker was produced to verify that I spoke the
language. By the time I was finally cleared, I almost
missed my flight. "Sorry for the delay," apologized the
young security officer. "Don't take it personally." 

El Al is a tiny airline that has a fleet of just 30 planes
and flies to a small handful of destinations. It is also
heavily subsidized by the government. This is what has made
El Al and Ben-Gurion safe from terrorists for more than 30
years. 

Getting the American airline system up to this level would
require a great deal more than reinforced cockpit doors and
the armed air marshals now aboard domestic and
international flights. It would require changing
everything, including the cost and frequency of flights.
Nothing could be simpler, right now, than flying from New
York to Pittsburgh -- every day, there are at least a dozen
direct flights available from the city's three airports and
countless more connecting flights. Bought a week or two in
advance, these tickets can be as cheap as $150 round-trip. 

Making U.S. airlines as security-conscious as El Al would
put the U.S. back where the rest of the world is -- maybe a
flight or two a day from New York to Pittsburgh, at much
higher costs, and no assurance whatsoever you can get on
the plane you want. Flights would take longer, and landings
might be a little more interesting, because pilots would
have to stay away from densely populated areas, where a
plane downed by a shoulder-launched Stinger missile could
do terrible damage. 

Kayaking in the Wrong Place Is a Federal Crime 

In a state
of full readiness, American cities would be a patchwork of
places you couldn't go near. At first, most people wouldn't
even notice when no-sail zones were instituted around all
50 major industrial ports in the country. Maybe they would
find out when they went to a local marina where they
occasionally rent a small outboard to go water-skiing and
found that it had been closed and relocated. Or maybe they
went kayaking up near the Indian Point nuclear plant on the
Hudson and spent an afternoon talking to the Coast Guard
after they got a little too close. 

There may be a lot of places private boats will be unable
to go, like anywhere near a shipping channel used by oil
and gas freighters. Infrared and video optronic systems
that can detect small boats, and even inflatable rubber
craft, may be deployed to enforce the no-sail zones. "We
invented it after terrorists rode a freighter to within 10
miles of Tel Aviv," says Rafael, the former Israeli rear
admiral, "and used inflatable boats to attack beachfront
hotels." 

Each optronic installation costs $2 million, and four or
five of the units would be needed to protect the approach
to any major harbor, Rafael says. The system would thus
cost around $500 million. 

"I'm always amazed at how lightly defended your industry
is compared to most other countries," says Hezy Ribak,
another Israeli intelligence expert, who runs a security
consulting firm. "In Israel, we treat security at our
industrial facilities the way we do borders. The stakes,"
he adds, "are just as high, higher if you consider the
damage terrorists can do if they infiltrate a nuclear power
plant or blow up a gas reservoir." 

The P-Glilot natural gas reservoir near Tel Aviv is a good
example of what security experts like Ribak have in mind
for the U.S. From a distance, P-Glilot doesn't seem all
that different than similar installations in New Jersey,
Ohio or Texas. The massive storage tanks are even painted
with quaint butterflies and birds. But just off the
highway, watchtowers dot the landscape. If you drive
closer, the complex takes on the feel of a military
garrison, with high walls and electric fences bristling
with sensors and cameras, and notices posted in Hebrew,
English and Arabic warning: "No Photography." Pull off
the road and park by the perimeter fence for a mere 15
seconds, and a metallic voice sounds from an unseen
loudspeaker, calling out your license plate number and
telling you to move on. 

"Security," Einav says, "is about layers, creating
buffer zones." On the ground, that means changing the way
industrial sites are guarded. Security precautions in the
U.S. are concentrated around the core of the targets -- be
they reactors, pumping stations or chemical plants --
rather than the perimeter. "Security at the main buildings
might stop environmental protesters or the lone crazy, but
it doesn't help in the case of a truck loaded with
explosives, because the terrorists have already reached
their objective," Ribak says. "Why give yourself so
little room? There should be as big a buffer as possible
between the first line of defense -- the perimeter of the
property -- and the target, to give yourself early
warning." 

Perimeters, Ribak says, will need to be equipped with
vibration sensors; thermal and infrared cameras; buried
magnetic detection devices that can distinguish between
humans, animals and vehicles; and several rows of
old-fashioned razor coil to delay intruders, giving guards
time to respond to alarms. 

In the U.S., where many industrial facilities are
concentrated in dense urban areas, such security measures
would necessitate the rerouting of highways and possibly
the relocation of neighborhoods that are just too close. In
New York City, power plants sit right in the middle of
residential neighborhoods, like the one at 14th Street and
Avenue D in the East Village. It is across the street from
Stuyvesant Town and a public housing project, home to tens
of thousands of people. Israeli security officials shake
their heads in astonishment at such "crazy" U.S.
practices, but then again who ever thought that putting an
airport next to the Pentagon was a security risk? 

Securing dense, mixed-use urban neighborhoods could not
only complicate housing markets and commuting patterns,
which are typically a disaster in most cities already, but
could also come at tremendous expense. Consider the Donald
C. Cook nuclear power plant in Berrien County, Mich. It has
two Westinghouse reactors and sits on a relatively cramped
650-acre plot. Just to provide a three-mile buffer around
the plant would run $76 million, according to U.S.D.A.
statistics on the average price per acre of land in
Michigan. For the Indian Point plant in Westchester, the
cost would be exponentially higher. Add to that the $3.5
billion to $7 billion estimated by a recent Princeton
University study to safeguard spent fuel pools from air
attack, the roughly $3.5 million price tag of new perimeter
sensors and the $160 million that Raytheon charges for a
Patriot missile battery capable of knocking out airborne
threats, and multiply the total by the 103 nuclear power
stations in the country. 

Now factor in the 276,000 natural gas wells in the U.S.,
the 1.5 million miles of unprotected pipelines, the 161 oil
refineries, 2,000 oil storage facilities and 10,400 hydro,
coal and gas-fired power generating stations, and you get a
sense of the costs involved. 

Every Day Is Super Bowl Sunday 

But you probably won't be
thinking about any of that when you go out to dinner or to
the movies or to a ball game. By then, it could all be
second nature. The restaurant attendant will go through
your purse and wave a metal-detector wand over your jacket,
as they do in Tel Aviv. The valet parker will pop open your
trunk and look through it before dropping your car off at
an underground garage, just as in Manila. 

If you take the family to a Dodgers game, you'll be able to
tell your kids how, back in the day, they used to have
blimps and small planes trailing ad banners over stadiums.
The flight restrictions, started at Super Bowl XXXVII in
2002, would not permit any planes within seven miles of any
significant sporting events. Fans would have to park at
least five miles from the stadium and board shuttle buses
to gates. Spectators would be funneled through
airport-style metal detectors and watched over by a network
of 50 cameras installed throughout the stadium. Air quality
would be monitored for pathogens by the type of portable
detectors brought in by the Army at last year's Olympics. 

Even people with no interest in sports who live in
high-rises near stadiums would know whenever game day came
round. "Tall buildings near stadiums are also a risk,"
says Col. Mena Bacharach, a former Israeli secret-service
agent who is one of the lead security consultants for the
2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. "They would have to be
swept for snipers or R.P.G.'s." R.P.G.'s? Those are
rocket-propelled grenades, another term that could become
an American colloquialism. 

It's still too early to tell what all this would mean to
ticket prices, but, in a sign of the changing times, the
security allocation alone for last month's Super Bowl was
$9 million -- the equivalent of $134 for every one of the
67,000 fans in attendance. 

Of course, public awareness programs could help to
significantly cut down counterterror costs. In Israel,
televised public service announcements similar to antidrug
commercials in the U.S. warn viewers to be on the lookout
for signs of suspicious activity. The messages are even
taught to schoolchildren, along with other important
survival tips, like how to assemble gas masks. "I was out
with my 7-year-old granddaughter the other day," recalls
Joel Feldschuh, a former Israeli brigadier general and
president of El Al. "And she sees a bag on the street and
starts shouting: 'Granddaddy, granddaddy, look. Quickly
call a policeman. It could be left by terrorists.' " 

What Is Your Security Worth to You? 

It is commonly held
that a country as big and confident in its freedoms as the
United States could never fully protect itself against
terrorists. The means available to them are too vast, the
potentially deadly targets too plentiful. And there is a
strong conviction in many quarters that there is a limit to
which Americans will let their daily patterns be disturbed
for security precautions. Discussing the possibility that
we might all need to be equipped with our own gas masks, as
Israelis are, Sergeant McClaskey of Baltimore assured me it
would never happen. "If it ever reaches the point where we
all need gas masks," McClaskey said, shaking his head with
disgust, "then we have lost the war on terror because we
are living in fear." 

What does it really mean, however, to "lose the war on
terror"? It's as ephemeral a concept as "winning the war
on terror." In what sense will it ever be possible to
declare an end of any kind? 

One thing that makes the decisions of how to protect
ourselves so difficult is that the terrorism we face is
fundamentally different from what other governments have
faced in the past. The Israelis live in tight quarters with
an enemy they know well and can readily lay their eyes on.
Terror attacks on European countries have always come from
colonies or nearby provinces that have generally had
specific grievances and demands. Americans don't know
exactly who our enemies are or where they are coming from.
Two of the recent thwarted terrorists, Richard Reid and
Zacarias Moussaoui, were in fact Europeans. 

The United States also lacks the national identity that
binds Israel and most European countries and helps make the
psychic wounds of terrorism heal faster. In Israel, hours
after a bombing, the streets are crowded again -- people
are determined to keep going. Immediately after 9/11,
that's how many Americans felt, too, but it's not at all
clear how long this kind of spirit will endure. 

Nor is it clear how we will absorb the cost. An adviser to
President Bush estimates that as much as $100 billion will
have to be spent annually on domestic security over the
next 10 years, if you factor in all the overtime accrued by
police departments every time there is a heightened alert.
There are many who believe, as General Odom does, that the
money is "insignificant." "At the height of the cold war
we used to spend 7.2 percent of G.D.P. on defense and
intelligence," he says. "We spend less than half that
now." 

Outside of defense and some of the entitlement programs,
however, domestic security will dwarf every other kind of
federal spending: education, roads, subsidized housing,
environmental protection. More than that, the decisions we
make about how to protect ourselves -- the measures we
demand, the ones we resist -- will take over our political
discourse and define our ideas about government in the
years to come. 

One significant argument against the creation of an
American security state, a United States that resembles
Israel, is that even there, in a society rigorously
organized around security, the safety of its citizens is
far from guaranteed. But what keeps Israelis going about
their daily lives -- and what might help Americans do the
same despite the fear of violence here -- is the
conspicuousness of the response and the minor sacrifices
that have to be made every day. The more often we have to
have our bags searched, the better we might feel. Sitting
in the kind of traffic jam that would have normally frayed
our nerves might seem almost comforting if it's because all
the cars in front of us are being checked for bombs. We may
demand more daily inconveniences, more routine abrogations
of our rights. These decisions are not only going to change
how we go about our days; they're also going to change our
notion of what it means to be an American. How far do we
want to go? 

"Security is a balancing act," says Einav, the former El
Al security chief. "And there are always trade-offs. Give
me the resources, and I can guarantee your safety. The
question is, What are you willing to pay or put up with to
stay safe?"

Barriers for California Reactor on Road to Nuclear Graveyard
By NICK MADIGAN

SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., March 4 -  Emptied of most of its innards, filled with
concrete and encased in a 40-foot steel canister, a decommissioned nuclear
reactor here is headed for a nuclear graveyard in South Carolina.

Or is it?

Officials here at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, where for 24
years the reactor produced electrical power, have been stymied in every
effort to find a path across the country for the reactor's shell, which
weighs 770 tons and displays mild radioactivity readings. Railroads, ports,
environmental groups and antinuclear coalitions -  even the Panama Canal - 
have thrown up roadblocks. Advertisement


Initially set to depart last month, the reactor might not leave until the
end of the year, possibly on an 11,000-mile sea voyage around Cape Horn, at
the southern tip of South America, and northward to whichever East Coast
port chooses to accept it. So far, none have. And that trip will happen
only if the Chilean government permits the reactor's passage through its
territorial waters. Another option is to go west from California, around
the world.

"This thing is the proverbial garbage barge," said Mark Massara, the San
Francisco-based director of coastal programs for the Sierra Club. "This is
a dangerous coastal transport project of unprecedented proportions."

While that assessment may be overblown, the debate over moving the San
Onofre reactor is a sign of trouble to come as huge amounts of nuclear
waste -  most of it spent uranium fuel, far more radioactive than the shell
of an old reactor -  travel from 70 sites nationwide to the Yucca Mountain
nuclear waste disposal site in Nevada if it opens, as projected, in 2010.

Normally licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate for 40
years, at least a dozen commercial-scale nuclear reactors have reached or
are nearing the end of their useful lives. In all, 103 remain in operation
out of 123 built since the late 1950's. Only a handful have been
dismantled, in most cases quietly. But as more reactors reach retirement
age and are decommissioned, the quandary of how to get them to their graves
is becoming increasingly pressing.

"There's a phobia because people don't have much scientific grounding in
nuclear power," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for the San Onofre plant's
majority owner, Southern California Edison. "We move radioactive material
in this country every day: We fly it, we drive it in vehicles, we ship it
by rail, by boat. There's really nothing novel in this."

Mr. Golden said the plant, which still operates two newer reactors that
provide electric power to 2.3 million homes and businesses in Southern
California, had already shipped 10 million pounds of pipes, pumps, valves,
motors and concrete from the site to a low-level nuclear waste dump in
Clive, Utah, by road and rail, without incident. The Clive site also
received five large components of the reactor: its 90-ton head; a
pressurizer of similar heft; and three steam generators weighing 250 tons
each.

The reactor itself, which was shut down in 1992, will become part of a
950-ton assembly once it is bolted to a 192-wheel trailer pulled by a truck
in front and pushed by another from behind, all of which will travel
together, whether by train, road or ship. The package must go to Barnwell
County, S.C., where a nuclear waste dump is licensed to handle more
elevated radiation levels than those at Clive. As it awaits a route, the
canister holding the decommissioned reactor barely shows signs of
radioactivity, Mr. Golden said.

"A CAT scan in a hospital will give you at least 1,000 millirems of
exposure in a matter of minutes, whereas a person straddling this package
for an hour will get the equivalent of 5 millirems -  like X-raying a
tooth," he said. "Of course, no member of the public will be anywhere near
it, so there will be no exposure."

Opponents of the move fear several possible situations, including terrorism
that they say could cause the reactor to contaminate a large area.

"An attack could more easily sink the barge in the river or the ocean,"
said Daniel Hirsch, head of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a nuclear
watchdog organization. Mr. Hirsch said he was dismayed that Southern
California Edison was struggling to get the reactor off its oceanfront site
and across the country, a $10 million job.

"It's the kind of thing you'd think they would have thought about before
they built this thing," he said.

But plant officials insist the obstacles are not insurmountable.

"This has been contemplated from the day we started," said James T. Reilly,
who oversees the reactor's decommission. "The technical and engineering
problems are fairly straightforward. We have permit and governmental
approval issues, not engineering issues."

Edison's first choice for transporting the reactor involved loading it onto
a train to Houston and shipping it from there on a barge around the Florida
Keys and up the Eastern Seaboard. But that plan fell apart last fall in a
conflict with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad over who would
assume liability in case of an accident.

Next, the utility devised a trip through the Panama Canal, but the
authorities there said regulations limited the weight of radioactive cargo
to 150 tons, and they refused to let it through.

There was opposition closer to home, too.

Since the Panama Canal plan and the more recent proposal to ship the
reactor around Cape Horn involved putting it on a boat, the package would
have to be trucked along eight miles of beach to a Marine Corps dock in
Oceanside. But environmentalists expressed concern about the beach and two
species of birds that nest there.

"Nobody's ever tried to maneuver something like this across such a wide
swath of significant coastal habitat in Southern California," said Mr.
Massara, the Sierra Club official.

In Charleston, S.C., where Edison hoped to unload the reactor for a
300-mile train trip to the burial ground, the South Carolina State Ports
Authority told a dock operator who had won a bid to handle the cargo that
his lease prohibited the presence of hazardous materials.

"The key issue is safety and security," said Byron Miller, a spokesman for
the ports authority. Edison officials are looking into alternative ports,
including at least one in Georgia. For now, the impasse means that the
reactor can neither leave here nor arrive there.

In a rare piece of good news for the utility, the California Coastal
Commission last month approved Edison's plan to move the reactor along the
beach to Oceanside. But Pedro Nava, a panel member, said, "This is like the
guy who built a yacht in his basement and can't figure out how to get it
out the door."

 Envirocare Critic Returns to Public Debate Despite Lawsuit
March 9 2003

following Envirocare, was hit with a $142 million lawsuit in which

with slanderous remarks. (Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune)

BY JUDY FAHYS THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

Cindy King has just lately started coming out of the cocoon she has occupied
for two years. King used to be the gadfly who, peering through bangs and
eyeglasses, watched Envirocare of Utah's every move. But that all changed
after Envirocare owner Khosrow Semnani, in a $142 million lawsuit filed two
years ago, accused the Sierra Club activist of driving business away with
slander. The effect has been to muzzle King. Since the suit, the bookish
environmental volunteer has rarely attended the Radiation Control Board
hearings where she had long been a niggling fixture.

King and the Sierra Club also bowed out of the watchdog coalition that
appealed Envirocare's license to accept hotter radioactive waste. And she
said nothing during the Initiative 1 fight last fall, nor during the recent
Capitol debate over hotter waste. King also declined to be interviewed for
this story. But her attorney, Steve Russell, says his client has been
SLAPPed -- targeted by a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. He
sees it as Envirocare's way of silencing one of its best-qualified and most
diligent critics. "It was a SLAPP suit from the start to scare people, get
them not to say anything bad about Envirocare," says Russell, who is working
pro bono. Advertisement

Semnani attorney Rod Snow disagrees. He insists his client had to address
the lies and rumors that were damaging his reputation and threatened to
persist. "The worst thing you can do is not respond," says Snow. "At some
point it gets totally reckless and irresponsible." Regardless of its intent,
King has clearly been intimidated by the suit, which was filed in January
2001.

Convinced she did nothing to harm Semnani's reputation or his business, she
fears the devastation of her family, and she even discussed divorcing her
husband to protect the family finances. About a dozen other defendants have
been dropped from the suit. Some, like former state legislator Dave Adams,
were named but never served with papers. Others, like waste-industry
executive Steve Romano, are tight-lipped. "All I can say is that it was
amicably settled between the parties," says Romano, who once worked for one
Envirocare competitor and now works for another. "I've signed papers that
say that is all I can say about the matter."

Russell has advised his client against signing a gag order. He notes: "She
has a right to say anything that she wants that is not defamatory." King, a
mother of two with a master's degree in public administration and policy,
landed in Envirocare's Utah defamation case after the corruption scandal
broke over the dubious relationship between Semnani and Larry Anderson, the
state's former top radiation official and a driving figure behind
Envirocare's success.

Anderson filed suit in state court in October 1996. He alleged that Semnani
had reneged on a $5 million consulting deal, including the business plan
that gave birth to Envirocare, which last year had $140 million in revenues.
Semnani admitted giving the former regulator cash, gold coins and a golf
course condominium in Park City worth $600,000, but he said he had been a
victim of extortion.

Meanwhile, a Texas-based company called Waste Control Specialists jumped
into the fray and began looking for evidence that Envirocare had somehow
cheated its business competitors. WCS hired private investigators whose
reports turned up four years later as ammunition against the
Semnani-Envirocare critics. The names of several defamation-suit defendants
linked to WCS dropped from the case after Envirocare paid the Texas company
a $20 million settlement in early 2001. According to the WCS parent
company's 2000 annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
Envirocare agreed to drop the Utah defamation suits, pull up its stakes in
Texas and pay cash to settle WCS's lawsuit claiming that Envirocare had
illegally interfered with WCS's business prospects.

Anderson paid dearly in the corruption scandal. The former Utah radiation
regulator was convicted of cheating on his taxes and is serving time in a
federal prison camp. Semnani pleaded guilty to tax fraud, paid a $100,000
fine and agreed to be a prosecution witness in Anderson's 2001 trial. His
company was investigated by federal agencies that send waste to his facility
and the state agency that regulates it, but no charges resulted from those
investigations.

Semnani and his company also have inched forward with the Utah defamation
case, leaving the cases of just two of the original 25 defendants active.
One is a former WCS employee who lives in Houston and has a pending lawsuit
in Texas against Semnani and Envirocare. The other is King, who was lumped
with all the original defendants, accused of spreading ugly and allegedly
illegal rumors about Semnani and his company.

Among them: that Envirocare colluded with state officials; that Semnani
slept with a female regulator; hired a prostitute for a regulator; traded in
illegal arms; financed Middle Eastern terrorists and made death threats.
King's attorneys have fought to learn exactly when and where King allegedly
slandered the businessman and his landfill business, but have been unable to
discover much more than what was stated in the original complaint. The court
papers charge that the Sierra Club activist "asserted that the Department of
Environmental Quality had abdicated its regulatory responsibility over
Envirocare for illegal reasons and made false claims of influence peddling."

For Envirocare's investigation, company attorneys confiscated the family
computer King used for her university class work and had the hard drive
reconstructed. They questioned her for more than two days. Snow would not be
more specific about the allegations against King, but he insists the
defamation claims are not SLAPPs. "They were not intended to and don't in
any way stifle legitimate public debates," he says.

A trial date has not been set yet, and Snow says it could be a year before a
jury hears the case. Jeff Metcalf persuaded King to step back out into the
light a few weeks ago to address a class he is teaching at the University of
Utah in the rhetoric of argument. He calls her a "lone voice" and "someone
who's studied her homework at a great personal cost to herself." For her
part, King has decided she will no longer allow the lawsuit to frighten her.
She has begun attending public hearings again and contributing to the public
debate about Envirocare. "The greatest crime," King told the class, "is not
to do this." fahys@sltrib.com

NYTIMES March 11, 2003 U.S. Withholds Approval for Nuclear Waste Storage on
Indian Reservation By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON, March 10 (AP) -  Federal regulators today blocked a proposal by
utility companies to store high-level nuclear waste on an Indian
reservation in Utah's western desert, citing dangers posed by a nearby Air
Force training range.

Private Fuel Storage, a consortium of eight electric utilities, had sought
to store uranium rods from nuclear reactors in casks on the Skull Valley
Goshute Reservation, 45 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, until a
permanent storage complex could be built at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Utah
officials objected, raising a number of safety concerns, including the
threat posed by military aircraft and earthquakes.

The Air Force flies thousands of training missions a year over the
sprawling Utah Test and Training Range, near the reservation.

"There is enough likelihood of an F-16 crash into the proposed facility
that such an accident must be deemed credible," the Atomic Safety Licensing
Board, an arm of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a 222-page
opinion today.

As a result, the board said, it is withholding approval of the project.

The board said it might reconsider its decision if Private Fuel Storage, or
P.F.S., could either persuade the Air Force to reduce the number of flights
over the reservation or show that the concrete and steel casks where the
waste would be stored could withstand an F-16 crash.

P.F.S. can also appeal the licensing board's decision to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, but it would be unusual for the commissioners to
overrule the board.

At a hearing last year, P.F.S. argued that a pilot would be able to steer a
plane away from the stored nuclear waste before any crash occurred. But the
safety board proved unswayed today.

In a statement, the consortium said it was reviewing the decision.

"While we are disappointed with this initial partial decision, we continue
to believe that our facility meets the federal regulations," said Scott
Northard, project manager for the utilities.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, called the decision "a
tremendous victory for safety and sensibility."

"I have never thought that this proposal was in the best interests of the
citizens of Utah," Senator Hatch said, "and I think this decision bears
that out."

The decision today was another reminder of a national problem: commercial
nuclear power plants around the country are running out of space to store
their spent reactor fuel. Indeed, storage pools at many plants are already
full.

So the companies that make up P.F.S. sought to find a remote area where the
radioactive waste could be stored until the Energy Department built a
permanent storage dump at Yucca Mountain. The department hopes to open the
Yucca Mountain complex by 2010, although that project still requires a
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and could be delayed.

The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes, an impoverished tribe with its
reservation in the Utah desert, sought the economic benefits of the project
and signed a deal with P.F.S. in 1997 to pursue the plan. The Skull Valley
Band has about 120 members, but only about a fifth live on the reservation.
Tribal officials hoped that the nuclear waste site could bring the others
back.

The deal's provisions were confidential, and the amount of money to be paid
the tribe was never officially disclosed.

"This was about getting cash for exploiting the safety of their neighbors,"
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt said.

Though opposing the project, the state could not veto it, because the
Goshutes are a sovereign tribe.

The proposed storage center would essentially be an 820-acre concrete
parking lot. On it would be rows of 4,000 casks with concrete and steel
walls, two and a half feet thick, encasing a total of 40,000 metric tons of
uranium.

WIPP truck carrying nuclear waste struck by pickup in Andrews
Associated Press

CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -  A Waste Isolation Pilot Plant truck carrying three
empty containers was struck by a pickup Wednesday in Andrews.

The WIPP truck was returning the nuclear waste transportation containers to
a South Carolina site, said Kerry Watson, assistant manager for the waste
program at the Department of Energy's Carlsbad field office.

The pickup hit the driver's side of the WIPP trailer after pulling out from
a stop sign. The WIPP truck sustained damage to the trailer fender and two
tires.

The driver of the pickup was cited for an improper left turn.

The accident will not affect the driver's work with Tri-State Motor Transit,
Watson said. It was the second traffic collision in the four years WIPP has
been open. The first occurred in August, when a pickup truck struck a WIPP
truck carrying waste from Idaho.

Legislative bill allows privatization of nuclear waste dump
BY JOHN REYNOLDS
AVALANCHE-JOURNAL

One state senator says the privatization is a sound option. Opponents say
operational and financial control of the low-level radioactive materials
dump near Andrews would slip away from the state.

ANDREWS -  As in the past two state legislative sessions, a roughly 16,000
acre chunk of land in Andrews County, not far from the New Mexico state
line, has drawn the attention of nuclear power activists.

At issue are bills in the state House and Senate which would allow a private
company to apply for a license to dispose of low-level radioactive waste.

The site will then serve as a central facility for low-level radioactive
waste generated in Texas and Vermont -  one of the states in a waste disposal
compact with Texas.

In addition, the license holder can accept low-level radioactive waste from
the U.S. Department of Energy.

Low-level radioactive waste refers to a wide spectrum of materials, ranging
from relatively innocuous materials, such as concrete used in a nuclear
power plant parking lot, to more dangerous materials, such as cooling rods,
which remain radioactive for a long time.

Based on the various criteria the applicant must meet, the existing
hazardous material site operated by Waste Control Specialists about 26 miles
west of Andrews likely would be a front-runner to win the license if the
legislation passes.

Texas passed legislation in 1993 obliging the state to take waste created by
states in the compact. Maine was a signatory to the compact, but pulled out
in 2002 after decommissioning its nuclear power plant.

"It's crucial we satisfy our obligation under the compact agreement," said
state Sen. Robert Duncan.

A private company must step in because the state has "spent nearly 20 years
without success and nearly $60 million in tax dollars trying to locate a
low-level radioactive waste site that would have been run by a state
agency," said Tony Proffitt, Waste Control Specialists' spokesman.

Duncan, R-Lubbock, likened licensing a private company to cutting out the
middleman because, even if the state owned the site, it still would need to
call on the private sector to manage a waste disposal facility.

The arrangement also will allow the state to more directly regulate the
license holder's behavior, he said.

The private license holder must be allowed to take in federal radioactive
waste because compact waste alone won't pay the expenses of opening and
maintaining the site, he said.

"There's some merit to the argument that a low-level waste site for only
compact waste probably would not be economically feasible without perpetual
infusion of tax dollars," Duncan said.

However, "I would support the concept only if there's a cap (on the amount
of DOE waste) I would be satisfied with," he said. "It's not my desire to
allow this site to grow any bigger than necessary."

But representatives from the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club and Public
Citizen have raised concerns about allowing a private company to hold the
license for the site.

They would prefer the state hold the license and subcontract site management
to a private company.

"We're concerned this is like giving away the farm and keeping the
mortgage," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of Public Citizen.

He said the private license holder will reap a substantial profit from DOE
waste "and when we need them 25 years from now, they'll walk away and leave
the state holding the bag."

Texas' two nuclear power plants will need to be decommissioned when they
reach the end of their operating lives in about 25 years.

"We just feel like there is no need for Texas to become a national dumping
ground in order to manage its own waste," said Erin Rogers of the Sierra
Club.

She also expressed concern the state won't require the license holder to set
aside enough money to deal with possible disasters.

"Taxpayers could be stuck paying for the hundreds of millions to billions of
dollars" in a cleanup, she said.

A leak at the facility is "just a matter of time," she said. "There's no way
you're going to contain that for as long as it's radioactive."

Both Smith and Rogers advocated construction of a compact waste site at
either the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant or the South Texas Nuclear
Project.

They noted that the vast majority of Texas' nuclear waste is produced at
those plants.

The communities there already are familiar with nuclear materials and have
significant infrastructure in place, Smith said.

However, according to Duncan, the power plant sites do not meet geological
criteria set forth in the bill because of runoff concerns.

Andrews County, on the other hand, receives less than 10 inches in rainfall
annually. The WCS site sits on 800 feet of clay, which is practically
impermeable, according to Proffitt.

"Everybody thinks WCS is the lead candidate because they do have the
facility there," said Duncan. Furthermore, "The folks in Andrews County are
real supportive."

Russell Shannon, vice president of the Andrews Industrial Foundation,
agreed.

"The science is good," he said. "The geology is right. With state oversight,
we just think this could be a real enhancement to the community."

The county also would receive 7.5 percent of WCS' proceeds, which would go
toward infrastructure improvements and improved training for the fire
department and other emergency personnel to handle any potential emergency,
Shannon said.

House committee approved radioactive waste dump bill
By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
© 2003 The Associated Press

West Texas lawmakers are pressing for legislation that would set up a
low-level radioactive waste dump to hold Department of Energy waste and
environmentalists are putting up a fight.

"Why do we feel the need to become the nation's dumping ground in order to
manage our own waste?" said Erin Rogers of the Sierra Club. "Every
radioactive waste dump in the country has leaked."

A House committee on Monday approved a bill by Sen. George "Buddy" West,
R-Odessa, that would allow the Texas Department of Health to issue a license
to a private company to handle the disposal of the waste. Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, has filed similar legislation in the Senate.

Low-level radioactive waste is a byproduct of medical, research and
industrial activities. It also is produced through the operation of nuclear
power plants.

The bills would allow for two sites to be set up. One would handle the waste
under a compact that requires the state to dispose of Texas and Vermont
waste. The compact is part of a nationwide plan to store low-level
radioactive waste regionally.

A separate but adjacent site would take Department of Energy waste, a
provision that caused lawmakers some concern last legislative session. Then,
the bill died in the House.

The risk of exposure to low-level radioactive waste, "I am told by
scientists, is very low in terms of harming the human health and the
environment," Bivins said.

While the bills do not say where a site could be set up, both Bivins and
West say Andrews County residents support setting up a site there. The bills
state that the site cannot be located in a county where average rainfall is
more than 20 inches a year, a standard that Andrews County meets, Bivins
said.

West said he lives within 35 miles of the proposed site. "My entire family
lives there," he said. "I think it's safe for me. I wouldn't do anything to
jeopardize my family."

The waste is not "high-level stuff," said Tony Proffitt, a spokesman for
Waste Control Specialists, which already operates a hazardous waste facility
in Andrews County and has been identified by Bivins as an "economically
solvent perspective licensee."

"It's not plutonium. It's not fuel rods," Proffitt said.

Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of Public Citizen's Texas office, said West's
bill has significant flaws and said the Legislature's job is to look after
the state, not just one county.

"The people of Andrews county will suffer the immediate impacts of a leaking
dump," Smith said.

West also said the state needs to have one central facility to store the
waste, rather than have it spread out across the state.

"You hear a lot of talk about dirty bombs. A lot of this stuff could
actually be used, I guess, in the composition of a dirty bomb if someone
wanted to," West said.

He said the site would have adequate security but after the committee
meeting, he said he did not know the level of security his bill provided.

Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, has proposed amendments to West's bill that
would increase the financial security a company must put up as well as
increase the physical security around the site.

Smith said West's bill now does not provide enough financial security to
"ensure that when the dump leaks, as almost all of them do, that Texans
won't be stuck with a huge tax increase to clean up the mess left behind."

The House and Senate low-level radioactive waste dump bills are HB 1567 and
SB 824.

Nuclear waste site bill passed by House panel
By Karen Brook
Star-Telegram Staff Writer

AUSTIN - A proposal to create a privately run West Texas dump site for
low-level radioactive waste from across the nation passed a House panel
Monday.

House Bill 1567, sponsored by a group of West Texas lawmakers, would
consolidate waste from up to 60 storage sites statewide at one site in West
Texas. It could license a private contractor to dispose of waste from Texas
and Vermont -- a partnership known as the Texas Compact -- and could
contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to dispose of waste from more
than 70 other sites nationwide.

The House Committee on Environmental Regulation passed the bill unanimously.

The only Texas company that has expressed interest in being licensed to run
the facility is Waste Control Specialists, which operates a hazardous waste
dump in western Andrews County northwest of Midland.

The Energy Department has estimated that because of that contract, up to 289
million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste could be stored in Texas.

Low-level radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of material, from
hospital waste that is radioactive for only a few weeks or months to parts
of decommissioned nuclear power plants that can be radioactive for
centuries.

Supporters say the bill would allay concerns about low-level radioactive
waste because it would no longer be spread throughout the state. The federal
contracts are needed to make the project economically viable for private
companies, backers said.

"We need to get that into one geographically safe, stable area so it can be
stored and assured isolation," said Rep. Buddy West, R-Odessa, a bill
sponsor.

Opponents say that the bill would be a cash cow for Waste Control
Specialists and that Texas can responsibly manage such waste on its own
without bringing in federal contracts.

Erin Rogers, outreach coordinator for the Sierra Club's state chapter, said
she favors a bill by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would have the
state hold the license and would only include waste from the two Texas
Compact states. It would stipulate that the waste be managed near one or
both of Texas' nuclear sites in an above-ground facility.

"We think that HB 1567 puts Texans at great financial, environmental and
national security risk," Rogers said. "Texas does not need to become a
national dumping ground in order to safely manage its own waste."

A similar bill made national headlines during the 2001 legislative session
when environmentalists were arrested for yelling insults at lawmakers from
the Senate gallery. It died in the House Calendars committee.

Japanese Utility Shuts Down Nuclear Grid

By ERIC TALMADGE Associated Press Writer

TOKYO (AP)--Staggered by a series of scandals, Tokyo's main power company
shut down the last of its 17 nuclear reactors for safety checks Tuesday,
meaning Japan's capital may soon face its first blackouts in nearly two
decades.

Tokyo Electric Power Co. took the final reactor offline at midnight, said
company spokesman Mamoru Shirakashi. Operations at the 16 other reactors
run by the company, known as TEPCO, already have been halted.

The closures represent an unprecedented crisis in Japan's power industry.

Though a system glitch left some 3 million people in Tokyo without power in
1987, TEPCO--the world's largest electric utility _ says the city has never
faced blackouts due to a shortfall in supply.

Senior government officials were quick to voice their concern.

"Unless we can restart the facilities whose operations are halted now, we
will inevitably face power shortages," said Yasuo Fukuda, the top
spokesman for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Cabinet.

"The government will do all it can," he said. But he did not offer any
suggestions on what the government could do.

To break its heavy reliance on imported oil, resource-poor Japan has long
pursued an ambitious nuclear power program. The country today gets about 30
percent of all its energy from nuclear reactors.

The industry has been plagued by accidents and coverups of lax safety
practices, however.

TEPCO was ordered to suspend operations for a thorough safety review after
it admitted last year to covering up structural problems and obstructing
government inspections at its reactors a decade ago.

The admissions only deepened concerns raised in 1999 by Japan's worst-ever
nuclear accident, when an uncontrolled reaction at a fuel-reprocessing
plant north of Tokyo killed two workers--later found to have been illegally
mixing uranium in buckets--and exposed at least 600 people to radiation.

No date has been set for restarting TEPCO's nuclear reactors.

That will depend on how long it takes to complete the safety checks and
"earn the public's understanding," spokesman Shirakashi said.

In the meantime, TEPCO plans to compensate for the shutdown, which accounts
for about 40 percent of the electricity consumed by Tokyo and its
surrounding areas, by reactivating five thermal power plants and purchasing
surplus electricity from other power companies.

Even so, it forecasts a shortfall of 9.5 million kilowatts--the equivalent
of the output from 10 nuclear reactors--when air conditioner use peaks in
Japan's sweaty summer months.

A unit of nuclear plant is shut down
By MICHAEL DAVIS
Houston Chronicle

Unit 1 of the South Texas Project nuclear plant near Bay City is shut down
indefinitely after some residue from reactor coolant fluid was found on
tubes near the bottom of the reactor, plant officials said Friday.

Bay City is about 50 miles southwest of Houston.

Theradioactive boric acid residue -- described by the company as about the
size of one-half of an aspirin -- was discovered a week ago when the unit
was shut down for scheduled refueling and maintenance The water flowing
through the reactor to cool it contains boric acid.

The powdery material was located on the outside of two instrument guide
tubes where they enter the bottom of the reactor vessel. These contain
instruments that measure reactor operations.

"We found two very minor indications of a slight seepage at the bottom of
the reactor vessel and are in the process of determining the root cause and
to fix it," said Ed Halpin, plant manager for STP. "Unit 1 will not be
returned to service until the problem is solved."

Halpin could not say how long the repairs will take, but added that it will
not have any effect on power consumers.

STP officials are working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which
will review any plan for corrective action before it is put into place.

"The unit is shut down and there is no danger to the public," said Victor
Dricks, spokesman for the NRC in Fort Worth. "We have been impressed with
the aggressive response of the licensee and are closely monitoring the
situation."

While the seepage discovered was minor, gone unchecked it could have led to
very serious problems, said Jim Riccio, nuclear policy analyst with
Greenpeace in Washington, D.C.

"The real concern here is that if they had not found the leak, the crack
could have grown large enough that they could not have made up the coolant
loss," Riccio said. "You lose enough coolant, you melt the radioactive fuel
rods in the core.

Early indications are that the seepage may have come from a weld where the
tube enters the bottom of the reactor, Riccio said. He attended an NRC
conference in Washington earlier this week at which initial information on
the discovery of the seepage was disclosed.

"It stirred a few people up," Riccio said.

The NRC has been advising nuclear plants using Westinghouse reactors -- as
STP does -- about so called "thimble tube thinning," for 15 years,
according to an agency bulletin on the problem dated July 26, 1988. Thimble
tubes run inside of the incore guide tubes where the residue was found.

"Wear of the thimble tubes results in degradation of the reactor coolant
system's pressure boundary and can also create a potentially non-isolable
leak of reactor coolant," according to the bulletin.

Unit 2 at the plant just south of Bay City is running normally. Each unit
has the capacity to produce 1,250 megawatts of electricity. The reactor
vessel is housed inside the concrete and steel-lined containment building.

In the meantime, the plant has a team of engineers who have re-examined all
of the instrument guide tubes, and no additional residue was found, the
company said.

In November of last year, Unit 1 had an unscheduled outage after operators
noticed some problems with the secondary cooling system, Halpin said. The
reactor was shut down manually.

The plant was plagued with problems a decade ago. It was shut down for most
of 1993 by the NRC and a new management team was brought in by Houston
Industries, the operator at the time.

Now, the plant is managed by the STP Nuclear Operating Co. It is owned by
AEP Texas Central Co., Austin Energy, City Public Service of San Antonio
and Texas Genco.

S. Texas nuclear plant has water leak
By Matthew L. Wald
The New York Times

WASHINGTON -A nuclear reactor in South Texas is leaking cooling water from 
the bottom of its giant reactor vessel, a development that experts view with 
concern because they have never seen it before at any plant, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission said Friday.

Technicians at the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, about 90 
miles southwest of Houston, found residues during refueling at one of two 
nuclear reactors, indicating that cooling water leaked at two places where 
instrument-carrying tubes enter the reactor core, according to the company 
that operates the plant.

No similar problems have been observed at TXU's Comanche Peak nuclear power 
plant near Glen Rose, company and NRC officials said.

Both of the nuclear power plants in Texas are pressurized water reactors and 
of similar designs.

Operators at all 103 commercial nuclear reactors in the United States have 
been giving closer attention to their reactor vessels since the discovery 
last year of extensive leaks in the vessel head at another plant, Davis-
Besse, near Toledo, Ohio.

The Texas plant, South Texas 1, shows much smaller signs of leaking than the 
Ohio plant. In both cases, technicians found deposits of boron, a chemical 
added to the water to control the nuclear reaction. The chemical remains 
after the water evaporates. At Davis-Besse, technicians cleaned out boron 
with shovels; in Texas, technicians found an amount about half the volume of 
an aspirin tablet, said Ed Halpin, the plant general manager.

No corrosion is visible, but no one is sure what is under the vessel. At 
Davis-Besse, the steel of the vessel was corroded. At that plant, which began 
operating in 1976, workers have replaced the vessel head, a part that was 
intended to last for the lifetime of the reactor. Davis-Besse has remained 
closed since the leak was discovered, 13 months ago.

The South Texas leak is unexpected and, so far, unexplained.

"This is the first time it's been seen, either here or abroad," said Victor 
Dricks, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Representatives of two national nuclear industry groups are at the plant to 
study the problem, and plant managers have promised to keep the reactor shut 
down until they find the cause and repair it to the NRC's satisfaction, 
Dricks said. The plant is now shut down for refueling.

The vessel is 14.4 feet wide and 46 feet high, made of steel about 6 inches 
thick. Its bottom has 58 points where instruments can be inserted to measure 
the flow of neutrons, the subatomic particles that sustain the chain 
reaction. There are deposits at two of the insertion points, although the 
volume of the deposits was apparently small, Dricks said.

"It suggests there may be a leak," Dricks said Friday. "It's possible there 
is a crack in the weld between the bottom-mounted instrument tube and the 
reactor vessel or along the length of the tube. We don't know if there is 
damage inside the reactor vessel. We have no reason to believe there is."

TXU's plant is operating at full power, said Rand LaVonn, TXU spokesman.

"Comanche Peak officials, like others in the industry, will be watching this 
develop because safety is our highest priority," LaVonn said.

At nuclear power plants around the country, cracks of some metal parts have 
been traced to stresses created during construction. Others have been caused 
by a phenomenon called intergranular stress corrosion cracking, which occurs 
in some metals when they are under stress at high temperature. But Halpin 
said he would not speculate about the cause of the boron deposits.

Water inside the vessel is at a temperature of more than 500 degrees and a 
pressure of more than 2,000 pounds per square inch, so even a small hole 
could release large volumes of radioactive water into a containment building. 
Dricks said, however, that the pumps in the plant's cooling system could 
inject water into the reactor faster than it could leak out through a small 
hole, so that the nuclear core would stay covered, preventing a meltdown.

A problem in making repairs is that the irradiation under the reactor is 
about 500 millirem per hour, Halpin said. At that rate, a worker would absorb 
in four hours the radiation dose that most reactor operators set as a limit 
for a full year. The repair work is usually completed by large teams of 
workers, each spending only a short period exposed to the radiation.

South Texas 1 is one of the newest plants in the country. It began operation 
in August 1988. South Texas 2, which is adjacent, followed in June 1989. It 
shows no sign of leakage. The two reactors are owned jointly by the cities of 
Austin and San Antonio, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, and Texas 
Genco LP, a generating company. The plant is operated by STP Nuclear 
Operating Co.

 Texas Reactor Vessel Is Leaking Water
By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON, April 18 -  A nuclear reactor in Texas is leaking cooling water
from the bottom of its giant reactor vessel, a development that experts
view with concern because they have never seen it before, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said today.

Technicians at the South Texas Nuclear Project, 90 miles southwest of
Houston near Wadsworth, have found residues that indicate that cooling
water leaked from the vessel through two penetrations where instruments are
inserted into the core, according to the plant operator.

Operators at all 103 commercial nuclear reactors have been giving closer
attention to their reactor vessels since the discovery last year of
extensive leaks in the vessel head at the Davis-Besse plant in Oak Harbor,
Ohio, near Toledo.

The Texas plant, South Texas 1, shows much smaller signs of leaking than
the Ohio plant. In both cases, technicians found deposits of boron, a
chemical added to the water to control the nuclear reaction, which remains
after the water evaporates.

At Davis-Besse, technicians cleaned out boron with shovels. In Texas,
technicians found an amount about half the volume of an aspirin tablet,
said Ed Halpin, the plant general manager.

No corrosion is visible, but no one is sure what is underneath. At
Davis-Besse, the steel of the vessel was so corroded that a metal part on
the head flopped over like a mailbox post that has been loosened from the
front lawn. Workers have replaced the vessel head, a part intended to last
for the lifetime of the reactor. Davis-Besse has remained closed since the
leak was discovered, 13 months ago.

South Texas 1 is one of the youngest plants in the country. It went on line
in August 1988. South Texas 2, which is adjacent, followed in June 1989. It
shows no sign of leakage.

The two reactors are owned by the Cities of Austin and San Antonio, a
subsidiary of American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, and Texas Genco, a
generating company that is a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy of Houston.

The South Texas leak is unexpected and, so far, unexplained.

"This is the first time it's been seen, either here or abroad," said Victor
Dricks, a spokesman for the regulatory commission.

Representatives of two industry groups are at the plant to study the
problem, and managers have promised to keep the reactor, which is closed
for refueling, out of operation until they find the cause and repair it to
the satisfaction of the nuclear agency, Mr. Dricks said.

The vessel is 14.4 feet wide and 46 feet high, made of steel about six
inches thick. Its bottom has 58 penetrations, where instruments can be
inserted to measure the flow of neutrons, the subatomic particles that
sustain the chain reaction. There are leaks at two penetrations, although
the water volume was apparently small, Mr. Dricks said.

At plants around the country, cracks of some metal parts have been traced
to stresses created in construction. Others have been caused by a
phenomenon called intergranular stress corrosion cracking that occurs in
some metals under stress at high temperature. Mr. Halpin said he would not
speculate about the cause in Texas.

Water in the vessel is at a temperature higher than 500 degrees and
pressure higher than 2,000 pounds a square inch. So even a small hole could
release large volumes of radioactive water into the containment building.

Mr. Dricks said, however, that the pumps in the emergency core cooling
system could inject water faster than it could leak through a hole the size
of the penetration, so that the nuclear core would stay covered. The design
is for contamination in such cases to stay in the containment dome.

A repair problem is that the radiation field under the reactor is about 500
millirem an hour, Mr. Halpin said. At that rate, a worker would absorb in
four hours the radiation dose that most reactor operators set as a limit
for a full year. Repair work in such high fields is usually carried out by
large teams of workers, each spending just a short period at work.

Residue keeps nuclear unit shut down
FROM STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS
Saturday, April 19, 2003

WADSWORTH -- Engineers at the nuclear plant near Bay City are examining
residue about half the size of an aspirin that was found April 12 while one
of the plant's reactors was shut down for refueling and maintenance,
representatives for the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station
said Friday.

The powdery material was found on the outside of two instrument guide tubes
where the tubes enter the bottom of the reactor, the plant representatives
said. The reactor, which is partly owned by the City of Austin, is encased
in a concrete and steel-lined containment building.

Tests indicate the residue came from reactor coolant fluid, plant officials
said.

"Finding this minute amount of residue demonstrates our inspection process
works," said Ed Halpin, the plant's general manager.

Officials with Austin Energy said the reactor problem won't affect their
delivery of electricity. But if the unit remains shut down for several
months, it could mean higher electric bills for customers.

Because the downed unit is taking 200 megawatts away from Austin Energy,
the utility will have to make up for it by burning costlier natural gas,
said Ed Clark, the utility's spokesman. Consumer bills will be noticeably
higher only if the loss continues into the hottest part of the summer. One
megawatt is enough to power 200 homes.

The plant said it is working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
review the needed corrective actions. The plant said a team of engineers
and chemists has reviewed all of the instrument guide tubes and found no
additional residue.

"Our priorities are to determine the cause of the problem and make sure our
corrective actions are effective," Halpin said, adding that the unit will
remain out of service until the problem is fixed.

The plant's other unit is operating at full power. The two reactors combine
to produce more than 2,500 megawatts for customers from Houston to Austin
and San Antonio to Corpus Christi.

Extraordinary Reactor Leak Gets the Industry's Attention
By MATTHEW L. WALD

WADSWORTH, Tex., April 30 - Reactor experts around the country hope that
there is something unique about Reactor No. 1 at the South Texas Project
here. If not, the little crust of white powder that technicians found at the
bottom of the reactor vessel, a discovery that has brought operations here
to a halt for the indefinite future, could be the beginning of a broad
problem for the nuclear power industry.

The powder, which managers here repeatedly compare in volume to about half
an aspirin tablet, is boric acid, which is used in reactor cooling water to
soak up excess neutrons, and its presence under the vessel presumably means
there is a leak.

Highly corrosive when damp, boric acid has been found in the last few years
on the lids of reactor vessels around the world. A plant near Toledo, Ohio,
accumulated 900 pounds, some of which ate away a football-size chunk of
steel in the vessel lid, leaving only a thin stainless-steel liner and
bringing the plant uncomfortably close to accident.

But until the discovery here, on April 12, nobody had ever seen a leak on
the bottom. A leak in that location is far harder to repair, and would be
harder to control if a significant hole developed in the vessel, although
the chances of accident seem far smaller than they did in Ohio.

"It is something different," said Gary Parkey, vice president of the South
Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company, which runs the two reactors here.

Measuring the problem and then resolving it will take new applications of
technology, he said, adding with no evident pleasure, "We are at the cutting
edge of this issue."

Until the discovery, in an inspection during a routine shutdown for
maintenance, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission believed that it understood
the mechanism for leaks in reactor vessels. It assumed that such leaks were
caused by an occurrence called stress corrosion cracking, which, after long
periods of operation, develops in hard metals that are under strain and high
temperature.

Not long ago, the commission developed a formula combining temperature and
years of operation, and used it to tell reactor operators around the country
whether they needed to shut down promptly for inspection or could do the job
at a more convenient time.

But the South Texas Project, here amid beef cattle and wildflowers 90 miles
southwest of Houston, is only 15 years old, and its reactors operate at a
relatively low temperature. That raises the possibility that there may be a
problem even with plants that scored well in the regulatory commission's
formula, and have not been inspected.

"If this turns out to be stress corrosion cracking, and there's nothing
unique about it, then it raises questions about the validity of that
equation," said Brian W. Sheron, the commission's associate director for
project licensing and technical analysis.

That would be bad news for the nation's 102 other commercial power reactors,
which despite vast electricity deregulation have prospered in the last few
years, by achieving new levels of reliability.

The South Texas Project boasted last year that its Reactor No. 1 generated
more electricity than any other in the nation in 2001, and ranked eighth
among the 433 power reactors worldwide. A majority of the plant is owned by
two commercial companies: Reliant Energy and an American Electric Power
subsidiary, AEP Central Power and Light; an additional 44 percent is owned
by the municipal utilities of Austin and San Antonio.

The plant's operators underscore that they caught the problem early.

"There was no puddle, no buildup of boric acid on the bottom," said the
general manager, Ed Halpin.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a group often sharply critical of nuclear operators, also
pointed out that the leak had been discovered early, but in an inspection,
he said, that was more thorough than the regulatory commission requires.

"It does show the prudence of looking periodically in places you don't
expect to have problems," he said, "rather than blindly assuming you're not
going to have problems except where you're looking."

One difficulty at the Ohio plant, Davis-Besse, was that management delayed
taking the time to remove thermal insulation around the vessel lid to check
for leaks. As a result, corrosion continued unnoticed for years. That
corrosion has been a nightmare for the Davis-Besse owners, keeping the plant
shut for 14 months so far and probably some months to come.

At both plants, the leaks occurred in places where the builders had
installed "penetrations" of the vessel. At Davis-Besse, those penetrations
allowed control rods to enter the core (to shut the reactor) and to be
withdrawn (to start it up).

Here, the penetrations are smaller, for dozens of pencil-size detectors that
are pushed up into the core to measure the flow of neutrons, the subatomic
particles that sustain the chain reaction. The leak apparently involves two
of these penetrations.

The safety implications of the problem seem manageable. Even if the reactor
were to have spit out a tube through which a neutron detector enters, the
hole would have been only 1.5 inches in diameter, well within the capacity
of emergency pumps to keep up with. And though water in the reactor was kept
at a pressure of 2,250 pounds, it is not clear that the reactor had been
anywhere near to ejecting a tube by the time the boric acid was discovered
little more than two weeks ago.

Still, while managers here do not yet know the cause of the leak, or
precisely how they will repair it, experts say the job will be complicated
and will involve significant radiation hazards.

The reason is that after months or years of sitting in the core, neutron
detectors are intensely radioactive. If the fuel of Reactor No. 1 is
removed, as operators expect for this repair, then the detectors will most
likely rest at the bottom of the vessel, since they are not designed to be
pushed into the middle of the reactor unless the fuel, and its associated
hardware, are present. Mr. Halpin, the general manager, said engineers were
working on a way to leave the probes in the middle of the vessel even with
no fuel present. But if they rest at the bottom, then a technician working
to repair the leak there could, in just a few minutes, receive from them as
large a dose of radiation as the industry allows a worker in a year.

Plant managers say they presume that the leaking parts are a pair of welds,
each connecting one tube to the stainless-steel liner inside the vessel. But
that place is too hard to reach for repairs, so they plan a weld on the
lower surface, where the tubes exit the vessel, six inches outside the
liner.

The problem is that this would permanently leave cooling water with the
corrosive boric acid in contact with the vessel wall, which is not stainless
but instead plain old carbon-steel, which can corrode. Not only would the
corrosion itself be a problem, but particles from the resulting rust could
do damage as they floated around the reactor.

The managers, however, argue that the volume of exposed carbon-steel would
be very small, and that the temperature during operations is too high to
allow corrosion anyway, a point on which they will have to satisfy the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission before they can proceed. Members of the
commission's staff will discuss the problem with the managers at a public
meeting in Washington on Thursday.

In the meantime, representatives from two associations of reactor operators,
and from five nuclear plants, have visited here and are watching carefully.

House: preliminary approval to low-level radioactive waste dump 
By APRIL CASTRO Associated Press Writer 
© 2003 The Associated Press

West Texas could become the site of the nation's largest low-level nuclear
waste dump under legislation preliminarily adopted Tuesday in the Texas
House.

The measure, adopted 107-34, would clear the way for the Texas Department
of Health to issue a license to a private company to administer the
low-level nuclear waste site.

The bill, by Rep. George "Buddy" West, R-Odessa, would allow for two
facilities to be set up. One would handle the waste under a federal compact
that requires the state to dispose of wastes from Texas, Maine and Vermont.
The compact is part of a nationwide plan to store low-level radioactive
waste regionally.

A separate but adjacent facility would take Department of Energy waste, a
provision that has caused lawmakers some concern in the past. Last session,
the bill died in the House.

Representatives engaged in hours of debate over the bill.

"We're clearly disappointed," said Erin Rogers, a spokeswoman for the
Sierra Club. "(The bill poses) massive financial liability to the state,
massive potential environmental damage and massive risk to the public
health and safety."

Andrews County, in West Texas, has been touted as an ideal location for one
of the sites and residents there have been supportive of the facility.

Low-level radioactive waste is a byproduct of medical, research and
industrial activities. Low-level radioactive waste also is produced by
nuclear power plants.

Environmentalists balked at the proposal, arguing that bringing a waste
dump to Texas would endanger residents' health and open the door to
terrorist attacks. Low-level radioactive wastes could be used to make
"dirty bombs," they said.

Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, argued that the state should be the license
holder, because private entities risk bankruptcy and abandonment of the
facility.

Proponents disagreed, saying the state has spent millions of dollars over
the past 20 years to study the idea.

"It is time for us to allow the private sector to help us secure a site to
dispose of low level radioactive wastes in this state," said Rep. Warren
Chisum, R-Pampa.

After the bill is finally passed, likely Wednesday, it will then go to the
Senate for debate.

House OKs radioactive dump after lengthy debate
By DINA CAPPIELLO
Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle Environment Writer

A bill that would set up a private dump for truckloads of low-level
radioactive waste won tentative approval in the House on Tuesday, despite
opponents' efforts to restrict the amount, type and origin of the refuse,
and its shipping routes.

In a five-hour floor debate, more than two dozen amendments were proposed
to H.B. 1567, which would permit the Texas Department of Health to license
a private company to construct a radioactive waste dump. The legislation
finally passed Tuesday evening with a 107 to 34 vote.

Environmentalists and opponents of the bill said their focus would be
redirected to the Senate, which has similar legislation pending in
committee.

"This is not over," said Erin Rogers of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra
Club. "The real fight will take place in the Senate." The bill has died
there in previous sessions.

Rogers said as many as eight senators are ready to block the legislation.

During the next 35 years, the dump would accept more than two million cubic
feet of low-level radioactive waste from hospitals, schools and nuclear
power plants in Texas and Vermont.

Currently, radioactive materials are stored at the state's two nuclear
power plants and at 61 other temporary storage sites, most in Harris
County. The bill's supporters argue these sites are targets for terrorists
looking for radioactive waste to construct dirty bombs.

"Since Sept. 11, we are under increased threat for a dirty bomb," said Rep.
Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, as he argued to table an amendment that would have
barred the dump from accepting federal waste produced during atomic weapons
manufacturing. Chisum sponsored the bill along with Rep. George "Buddy"
West, R-Odessa, and Rep. Wayne Smith, R-Baytown.

The legislation satisfies a 1993 compact in which Texas agreed to take
Maine and Vermont's waste for $25 million each. But after years of studies
and $60 million in expenses in unsuccessful attempts to find a site for a
landfill, Maine pulled out of the compact.

The legislation this year differs from previous attempts to site a
low-level radioactive waste dump because it would allow the state to take
radioactive refuse from federal sites, an amount that could total nearly
300 million cubic feet over the 35-year period.

Much of the debate centered on who would regulate and control the site, how
much money the company would have to put up for a possible future cleanup,
and the risk of leaving waste in metropolitan areas versus moving it to a
centralized location.

But only a handful of amendments were accepted. One would bar the licensed
company from accepting radioactive waste if it violated an environmental
law. Another would make it mandatory for the waste company to take out an
insurance policy.

The leading contender for the landfill is Pasadena-based Waste Control
Specialists, which operates a hazardous waste landfill along the New Mexico
border in Andrews County. The company has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars in lobbyist fees and contributions to Republican lawmakers.

West Texas radioactive waste dump clears hurdle
By Karen Brooks
Star-Telegram Staff Writer
AUSTIN _ As environmentalists across the nation marked Earth Day 2003 on
Tuesday, the Texas House gave early approval to a plan that would allow
other states and the federal government to dispose of more than 400 million
cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste in a West Texas dump site.

The last time the Legislature took up the issue, protesters were arrested
in the Senate gallery, an opposing House member nearly passed out in the
chamber from stress, and the bill died before it hit the House floor.

This time, the bill got an easier ride. After the handy defeat of several
attempts by House environmentalists to change or kill the bill, it won
preliminary approval 107-34. It awaits likely final approval in the House
before going to the Senate.

The bill's sponsor called it a "workable solution to a growing health and
security problem in our state."

"It's been a long day," said state Rep. George "Buddy" West, R-Odessa. "Of
course, we've come this far before. We just hope this time we can carry it
on to fruition and make it become law in the state of Texas."

Environmental groups lamented the bill's passage, saying that it would turn
Texas into a national nuclear dumping ground and was written for the sole
benefit of a single company that wants to make money.

"We're extremely disappointed," said Erin Rogers, outreach coordinator for
the Sierra Club's state chapter. "This is the biggest long-term boondoggle
the Legislature has passed this session. Massive financial liability to the
state, massive potential environmental damage, and massive risk to the
public's health and safety."

House Bill 1567 would allow the state health department to license a
private company to maintain a disposal site for waste that would remain
radioactive anywhere from a few days to more than 20,000 years.

The bill would consolidate waste from up to 60 storage sites statewide at
one site in West Texas. The private company would also oversee the disposal
of waste from Vermont, which already has a partnership with Texas. It
allows the company to also contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to
dispose of waste from more than 70 other sites nationwide.
Environmentalists say that deal would increase the amount of radioactive
waste stored in Texas by 200 percent.

Opponents say there is no incentive to minimize the amount of waste coming
into Texas, and the state could be left with an ugly clean-up tab if the
company goes bankrupt or abandons the site.

Supporters say consolidating the waste is easier to control and guard when
it's in one spot. The federal waste contracts are necessary to make the
project profitable enough for a private company to operate it, backers say.

Although no specific site or company is named in the bill, the frontrunner
is Waste Control Specialists, which operates a hazardous waste dump in
western Andrews County northwest of Midland. Bill backers say that location
is among the few in Texas that are ideal because there are no flooding or
groundwater issues.

The bill is sponsored by a contingent of West Texas legislators whose
districts include western Andrews County.

Texas has spent two decades and $50 million trying to set up a low-level
radioactive waste disposal site to be run by a state agency. Four years
ago, the state tried to establish a disposal site in Sierra Blanca, south
of El Paso, but failed after residents objected. In 2001, lawmakers
abolished the state's Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority.

The Energy Department has estimated up to 289 million cubic feet of
low-level radioactive waste could be stored in Texas under a contract
allowed by the bill.

Low-level radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of material, from
hospital waste that is radioactive for only a few weeks or months to parts
of decommissioned nuclear power plants that can be radioactive for hundreds
of thousands of years.

Bill opponents, led by state Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, tried Tuesday
to limit the amount of waste coming in, how the waste can be transported
through Texas and what types of waste would be allowed by the bill. They
failed.

"We're setting ourselves up to be the nation's largest nuclear waste dump,
and people are not grasping that," Burnam said.

Briefs

Radioactive waste dump may be coming to state

The House approved a bill Wednesday that would make Texas home to one of
the nation's largest low-level radioactive waste dumps, but with an
amendment requiring better security for the most heavily contaminated
material.

HB 1567, by Rep. George "Buddy" West, authorizes the Department of Health
to grant a license to a private company to operate such a landfill. In the
next 35 years, the dump would receive millions of tons of waste from
hospitals, laboratories and nuclear power plants in Texas and Vermont.

Low-level waste from the U.S. Department of Energy also could be discarded
there.

Rep. Vicki Truitt, R-Southlake, offered an amendment requiring that 10 to
20 percent of the waste be stored in aboveground vaults that would be
regularly monitored and easily isolated from the environment.

"It's a good amendment," said Erin Rogers of the Lone Star Chapter of the
Sierra Club. "We just wish it was all of the waste."

So far, the only company that has applied for the license is Waste Control
Specialists, which wants to open a facility in Andrews County in West
Texas. A similar bill is pending in a Senate committee.

Nuclear-waste bill advances
House tentatively OKs allowing materials from weapons sites, 2 states
04/23/2003
By GEORGE KUEMPEL / The Dallas Morning News

AUSTIN - A bill to allow millions of cubic feet of low-level radioactive
waste from the nation's nuclear weapons facilities and two other states to
be disposed of in Texas was tentatively approved by the state House on
Tuesday.

"Texas can't afford this bill and should not become the nation's
nuclear-waste dumping ground in order to enrich one private company at our
expense," said Rep. Dora Olivo, D-Rosenberg.

Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, and other sponsors said, however, that the
measure will isolate at one spot radioactive materials stored at hundreds
of sites across the state and put them out of terrorists' reach.

"We need to get the waste at one site and not have something that would
allow ... [someone] to create a dirty bomb," he said.

The bill was tentatively approved, 107-34, and after a final vote - perhaps
as early as Wednesday - will be sent to the Senate.

The state has spent 20 years and more than $50 million in utility customer
surcharges trying to find a suitable site for disposing of its low-level
radioactive material. It signed an agreement 10 years ago to take waste
from Maine and Vermont.

But supporters say the fees to be paid by the two states won't pay for a
disposal facility and agreed to allow the private operator to also take up
to 300 million cubic feet of low-level waste mostly from the nation's
nuclear weapons facilities.

Tuesday, sponsors beat back amendments that would have banned or reduced
the amount of federal waste allowed, restricted the type of materials
coming in and denied access to states other than Maine and Vermont.

An amendment by Rep. Jesse Jones, D-Dallas, that would have allowed county
commissioners to designate routes for radioactive materials being
transported through their counties also was struck down.

Mr. Jones said he was concerned that the trucks or trains carrying the
material could be involved in an accident or be held up or taken over by
terrorists.

Rep. George "Buddy" West, R-Odessa, one of the co-sponsors, said the
amendment would make the bill "unworkable." He noted that the federal
transportation agency already has designated routes for hazardous
materials.

Also rejected were other amendments by Mr. Jones that would have prohibited
the transport of radioactive materials within one mile of churches, schools
and playgrounds and required transporters to carry enough insurance to
cover the cost of any accidents.

Critics charged, in effect, that the bill was written to benefit
billionaire Dallas investor Harold Simmons, who they said stands to make
hundreds of millions of dollars from the proposal.

A company controlled by Mr. Simmons that operates a hazardous waste dump in
Andrews County in West Texas, Waste Control Specialists, is almost sure to
get the license to operate the dump, they said.

Mr. Simmons has spent millions in lobbying and other expenses over the
years in Austin and in Washington to get the lucrative business of
disposing of the U.S. Department of Energy's radioactive waste.

Envirocare Inc., a company that owns a low-level radioactive-waste facility
in Utah, also is interested in the Texas license. But it doesn't have a
site in Texas and might be reluctant to post the nonrefundable
license-application fee of $500,000 in light of Mr. Simmons' political
connections.

Mr. West denied that the bill was designed to give the business to Mr.
Simmons' company, but he acknowledged that Andrews County is an ideal site
for the dump.

"It meets all the criteria," he said.

A delegation of Andrews County business and government officials who want
the dump and the jobs it will bring watched the debate from the gallery.

Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, the most vocal critic, said the bill is the
handiwork of special interests. He did not name any particular company.

"The bill was driven, written and pushed by people who are excessively
greedy," he said.

US back in nuclear bomb-making business

April 24 2003

The United States says it has regained the capability to make nuclear
weapons for the first time in 14 years and has resumed production of
plutonium parts for bombs.

The Energy Department's announcement on Tuesday marks a symbolic and
operational milestone in rebuilding America's nuclear weapons complex,
which began a long retrenchment in the late 1980s as the Cold War ended and
the toll of environmental damage from bomb production became known.

Under a Bush Administration plan, the Energy Department will begin limited
production of plutonium parts for the country's stockpile of nuclear
weapons and begin laying plans for a new factory that could produce parts
for hundreds of weapons a year.

The Energy Department's previous Rocky Flats site in Colorado was shut down
after serious violations of environmental laws and the FBI raided the
plant.

More potent 'bunker buster' on way
By Dan Stober
Knight Ridder News Service

SAN JOSE, Calif. -Demonstrating a significant shift in America's nuclear
strategy, the Bush administration intends to produce -- not just research
-- a thermonuclear bunker-busting bomb to destroy hardened, deeply buried
targets, the Pentagon has acknowledged for the first time.

The weapon, known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, would be a
full-power hydrogen bomb that would throw up enormous clouds of radioactive
dust while wreaking large-scale damage and death if used in an urban area.
It would be thousands of times more powerful than the conventional "bunker
busters" that were dropped on Baghdad in an attempt to kill former Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.

Federal officials signed documents in Washington, D.C., this week to launch
a preliminary design contest between Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Because of
the time needed for congressional funding, officials at the National
Nuclear Security Administration say, they might seek more money for
development even before the preliminary work is completed in 2005 or 2006.

Arms-control advocates are disturbed by such weapons, saying that they are
not needed and only encourage other countries to build nuclear weapons as
fast as possible. They say such weapons are unnecessary because buried
bunkers can be destroyed with conventional bombs or by sending in troops to
attack entrances, air shafts and communications cables.

Fred Celec, the deputy assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear
matters, made clear that the White House wants the weapon and is moving
forward.

If a hydrogen bomb can be designed to survive a crash through hard rock or
concrete and explode, "it will ultimately get fielded," Celec said in an
interview with the San Jose Mercury News. The United States has worked on
nuclear earth penetrators for decades, and scientists involved in the
project say they expect to succeed.

The project is integral to the administration's push to move away from Cold
War "city scrapping" ballistic missile warheads to battlefield "tactical"
weapons.

"This administration is very serious about rethinking the entire thing,"
said a physicist at a U.S. nuclear weapons lab. "I think everyone around
here is really encouraged to look at what the actual role is for nuclear
weapons."

Small Commemorations Mark Chernobyl Disaster
Sat April 26, 2003 02:06 PM ET
By Andrei Makhovsky

MINSK (Reuters) - Small gatherings in three ex-Soviet states marked the
17th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster on Saturday, the world's worst
civil nuclear accident blamed for thousands of deaths and contamination
across Europe.

About 2,000 people met in central Minsk, capital of Belarus, to mourn
victims and denounce President Alexander Lukashenko, accused in the West of
stifling opposition.

Events in Ukraine, site of the nuclear plant closed in 2000, and Russia,
drew fewer people. Low attendance may have been linked to preparations for
Orthodox Easter celebrations in all three countries.

In Belarus, where about one-fifth of land was contaminated downwind from
the explosion and fire across the border, demonstrators carried the
red-and-white national flag banned by Lukashenko after he took office in
1994.

They accused authorities of minimizing the effects of the disaster and
denounced Lukashenko's decision in the mid-1990s to allow impoverished
residents to return to contaminated regions.

"Chernobyl and Lukashenko -- our two tragedies," read on poster.

In Ukraine, hundreds of mourners pressed into a church in Slavutych, the
town built to rehouse the station's staff, at precisely 1.24 a.m., when the
explosion blew the roof off Chernobyl's fourth reactor on April 26, 1986.
Small groups attended memorials in Kiev, 140 km (90 miles) to the south.

Demonstrators in Crimea denounced government moves to limit compensation to
thousands who claim "liquidator" status -- those who helped put out the
blaze and erect in the weeks that followed a concrete "tomb" around the
stricken reactor.

In Moscow, about 30 ecologists paraded outside the Atomic Energy Ministry
with signs bearing the names of Russian villages contaminated in the
disaster and denounced pollution linked to nuclear facilities in other
regions.

Although only about 30 people died in efforts to put out the blaze, about
5,000 deaths are now blamed on the accident, the result of an unauthorized
experiment that ran out of control.

RADIATION, DISEASE

About five million people suffered the effects of radiation and researchers
are still charting long-term incidence of thyroid cancer and other
diseases.

In the run-up to this year's anniversary, fresh accusations emerged that
the tomb, or sarcophagus, encasing the reactor could collapse and unleash a
new ecological disaster.

Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev, interviewed by
Izvestia newspaper, renewed earlier accusations, saying conditions inside
were becoming increasingly uncertain.

"The sarcophagus was meant to be built for five years, it has stood for 17.
No one is investigating in detail the reactions occurring inside," he told
the daily.

"This is not a question of money. Chernobyl has become a site mixed up with
political interests."

Ukraine closed the plant's last functioning reactor in 2000 under
international pressure. But proposals to build a new tomb have made no
progress and Ukraine is still seeking Western assistance to complete two
unfinished reactors elsewhere.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko this week dismissed suggestions
of safety concerns.

Secret KGB archives released earlier showed the Soviet secret police knew
the plant was dangerous long before the disaster.

Testing a New Generation of Weapons

(April 28) -- Could the testing of nuclear weapons one
day resume at the Nevada Test Site? The Bush
administration has asked Congress to approve a big
step in that direction.

The ban on nuclear testing, enacted in the early 90's,
is considered vital to worldwide efforts to limit the
spread of atomic weapons. So what reasons could there
be for even thinking about firing up the test program
once again?

Issues don't get any bigger than nuclear weapons and
nuclear testing, and Nevada will be in the thick of it
no matter what is decided. Last month, the Bush
administration asked Congress to repeal the ban on
research into low yield nuclear weapons.

The administration had already released a study saying
we need to be better prepared for resumed testing. So
what's really afoot here? And what could it mean to
our state? It's been 31 years since above ground
nuclear tests were banned. No place in the world saw
more of these fiery blasts than Nevada.

Concerns about radioactive fallout sent nuclear tests
under ground but underground tests were halted in
1992. The U.S. and Russia hoped that stopping the
tests would limit the proliferation of atomic weapons.

"I don't think it's worked," said Troy Wade, nuclear
weapons scientist. Nuclear scientist Troy Wade was
project manager, meaning, the guy who pushed the
button, on 30 nuclear tests in Nevada.

He's been involved in development and testing of nukes
since 1958 and thinks the U.S. is risking everything
by not being able to test its atomic stockpile. Most
of America's weapons, he says, are well past their
prime.

"Many of those nuclear weapons have exceeded their
design lifetime by many years. The stockpile is very
old, and that's a concern," said Wade. He adds that
more than half of the stockpile is beyond its shelf
life.

America's nuclear stockpile unquestionably helped to
prevent catastrophe during the Cold War years, but as
these complicated weapons grow older and less
reliable, Wade and others wonder if they will still
serve as a deterrent.

Deep under the surface of the Nevada test site, in a
secretive honeycomb carved into the dirt, scientists
try to simulate nuclear tests in experiments that, by
law, must be subcritical, that is, something that
stops short of an atomic reaction. Information is then
fed into computers to evaluate what kind of shape our
stockpile is in -- good but not as good as in the
past.

"The confidence level has gone down. It's not 99% like
it was. We have evidence there's been a degradation of
parts," said Wade. He argues that subcritical tests
and other measures are valuable, but that they are no
substitute for an actual test in evaluating the
reliability of our weapons. However, even if the U.S.
wanted to conduct a test, it couldn't.

Recent studies show it might take three years to
prepare for the real thing. Not only have the
facilities been dismantled, but experienced personnel
are simply gone. "We're not in very good shape,
frankly. Look at the color of my hair and beard,
people who grew up in this program are retiring or
dying, said Wade.

The Bush administration has asked that the prep time
for a test be reduced from 36 months down to 18. Such
a policy might mean millions of new dollars -- and
renewed life -- for the test site. Nuclear opponents
are appalled by the move and worry it might spark a
new arms race.

Even test site supporters like Senator Harry Reid urge
caution. "I'm not going to advocate a resumption of
nuclear testing simply because it's economically good
for the state. Can't do that," said Senator Harry
Reid, (D) Nevada.

If we do anything like a resumption of testing, it
must be with the support of the world. It can't be
unilateral. It's the rest of the world that has Troy
Wade and military labs worried. The test ban didn't
stop rogue nations like North Korea or Iraq from
pursuing their own nukes. India and Pakistan continued
testing.

The U.S. suspects Russia and France have done secret
tests, while U.S. weaponry continues to age. "The only
people who stopped for sure were the U.S. and the
United Kingdom," said Wade. Senator Reid says that
while he supports the idea of getting the test site
more prepared to do testing, he doesn't support the
resumption of testing itself and says the stockpile is
reliable.

Opponents say any testing, even subcritical, will only
encourage other nations to get their own nukes.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE
Senate adopts plan for twin dumps
Associated Press

AUSTIN -- A low-level radioactive waste site that would take Department of
Energy waste would be set up under legislation approved in the Senate on
Wednesday after a long debate about how much material the site should be
allowed to handle.

House Bill 1567, approved on a 23-6 vote, authorizes the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality to issue a license to a private company to administer
the site.

Two facilities would be set up. One would handle waste under a compact that
requires the state to dispose of waste from Texas, Vermont and Maine,
although Maine is in the midst of withdrawing from the agreement. The
compact is part of a nationwide plan to store low-level radioactive waste
regionally.

A separate but adjacent facility would take Department of Energy waste.

Although the bill does not say where the site could be set up, bill sponsor
Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, has said Andrews County residents support setting
up a facility in their West Texas county. A Pasadena-based company, Waste
Control Specialists, already operates a hazardous waste storage facility
there and has pushed for the legislation.

"The reality is there is low-level radioactive waste stored on building tops
all over Dallas and Houston and Austin and we would like to create a stable,
suitable site for this waste to be disposed of so that people in the urban
areas are not put at risk," Bivins said.

Low-level radioactive waste is a byproduct of medical, research and
industrial activities. It also is produced by nuclear power plants. Bivins
has said a majority of the Energy Department waste is dirt.

Most of the debate came on the issue of how much federal waste Texas should
accept.

Bivins' bill allowed for up to 10 million cubic yards of federal waste to be
stored at the site, but Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, offered an amendment
that would have limited that amount to 1.3 million cubic yards.

"I know this is in Senator Bivins' district, but it's also in my
neighborhood," Duncan told the lawmakers, who approved the amendment.

The senators finally agreed to allow the site to hold up to 6 million cubic
yards of federal waste.

Bivins said he believed companies would be interested in competing for a
permit with that cap in place. Duncan argued against the change, saying it
would make Texas the dumping ground of the United States.

The House has approved a similar bill. If the House does not concur with the
Senate changes, a committee of House and Senate members will be assigned to
work out the differences.

Senate approves bills setting up radioactive waste site

makes a profitable operation much more profitable for one operator
and the decision that we make here is important for generations of
Texans," said Shapleigh, D-El Paso.

AUSTIN - A bill to authorize creation of the first low-level radioactive waste
dump in Texas won approval from the Senate on Wednesday, but only after the
measure was changed to limit the amount of material that could be stored at
the site.

Unlike the House version of the legislation, which has no limits, the Senate
bill would restrict the radioactive waste at the dump to no more than 6
million cubic yards - mostly of contaminated dirt.

Senators approved the measure on a 23-6 vote. It now returns to the House for
consideration of Senate amendments.

The proposed facility would receive low-level radioactive waste from the
nation's nuclear weapons facilities and from Texas and two other states.

"We need to create a stable, suitable site for this waste to be disposed of so
that people in urban areas are not at risk," said Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, author of the bill.

"The facility would only be authorized to accept and dispose low-level
radioactive waste, which typically has a low potential for harm to human
health and the environment."

But several senators said they were not convinced that the dump would pose no
environmental threat, and they offered a series of amendments to restrict
operations and improve safeguards. Most were rejected.

Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, offered an amendment to limit the amount of
radioactive waste to 1.3 million cubic yards - a fraction of the 10 million
cubic-yard limit proposed by Mr. Bivins.

The amendment was initially approved on a 16-14 vote, prompting an irritated
Mr. Bivins to declare that the site would never open with such a restriction.
Senators later adopted another amendment allowing 6 million cubic yards.

"This makes Texas the dumping ground of the United States and the world," Mr.
Duncan said.

The leading candidate for the license is Waste Control Specialists, which
operates a hazardous waste dump in Andrews County in West Texas. The company
is controlled by Dallas billionaire investor Harold Simmons, who has spent
millions of dollars on lobbying and other expenses to obtain the right to
dispose of radioactive waste from the U.S. Department of Energy.

While Mr. Bivins acknowledged that Mr. Simmons' company is a front-runner to
get the license, he insisted the bidding would be open. One company that could
be interested is Envirocare Inc., which operates a low-level radioactive waste
facility in Utah that is the only one now accepting material from the Energy
Department.

Senate approves bill to create storage site

A low-level radioactive waste site that would take Department of
Energy waste would be set up under legislation approved Wednesday in
the Senate.

House Bill 1567, approved on a 23-6 vote, would authorize the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality to issue a license to a private
company to administer the site.

Two facilities would be set up. One would handle waste from Texas,
Vermont and Maine, though Maine is in the midst of withdrawing from
the agreement. An adjacent facility would take Department of Energy
waste.

Although the bill does not say where the waste site could be set up,
bill sponsor Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, has said Andrews County
residents support setting up a facility in their West Texas county.

"The reality is, there is low-level radioactive waste stored on
building tops all over Dallas and Houston and Austin, and we would
like to create a stable, suitable site for this waste," Bivins told
lawmakers.

The bill goes back to the House to consider Senate changes.

Low-level radioactive waste is a byproduct of medical, research and
industrial activities. It also is produced by nuclear power plants.
Bivins said a majority of the waste is dirt.

Quote of the day
"It's purely politics. It's purely perception."

on the amount of low-level radioactive waste to be allowed at a
proposed dump site in West Texas.

Waste site plan clears Senate
By John Moritz
Star-Telegram Austin Bureau

AUSTIN - A two-decade effort to establish a dumping ground for
low-level radioactive waste cleared a major hurdle Wednesday when the
state Senate approved a plan that would allow up to 6 million cubic
yards of the material to be buried in West Texas.

The legislation adopted by the Senate significantly changes the
measure that passed the Texas House last month to allow the state to
license a private company to maintain a disposal site for waste that
would remain radioactive.

State Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, said the legislation is needed
because radioactive waste generated by hospitals, industries and
utilities is either improperly stored in cities across the state or
not disposed of at all.

"We would like to create a suitable site for this waste to be disposed
of so that the state's urban areas are not put at risk," said Bivins,
the Senate sponsor of House Bill 1567, who emphasized that the site
would not store spent nuclear fuel or waste from nuclear weapons.

The legislation would pave the way for consolidating waste from up to
60 storage sites statewide in one place, most likely in Andrews County
in West Texas. The company that wins the state license would also
oversee the disposal of waste from Maine and Vermont, which already
have a partnership with Texas.

The bill would also allow the company to contract with the U.S.
Department of Energy to dispose of waste from more than 70 other sites
nationwide. Environmentalists say that proposal would increase the
amount of radioactive waste stored in Texas by 200 percent.

The legislation now goes back to the House for consideration of
changes made in the Senate.

Among the Senate-initiated changes were a provision that would make
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality responsible for issuing
the license and overseeing the work done by the private company. The
House bill would put the dump and the operator under the auspices of
the Texas Department of Health.

The Senate also capped the amount of waste that the Texas site could
accommodate at 6 million cubic yards. The House version contained no
cap.

The issue of how much waste to allow tied the Senate in knots during
more than two hours of debate. Bivins, who represents the district
where the dump will probably be located, proposed setting the cap at
10 million cubic yards.

Lubbock Republican Robert Duncan, whose district is near the site,
offered an amendment that would cap the waste at 1.3 million cubic
yards. Bivins said that no private company would accept such a
restriction.

Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, suggested a compromise that would
allow for 6 million cubic yards. Bivins embraced the gesture; Duncan
balked.

"I know you're trying to help [but] this doesn't help," Duncan told
Wentworth. "This makes Texas the dumping ground of the world, or of
the United States."

But by an 18-12 vote, senators accepted the compromise.

Texas has spent two decades and $50 million trying to set up a
low-level radioactive waste disposal site to be run by a state agency.
Four years ago, the state tried to establish a disposal site in Sierra
Blanca, south of El Paso, but that failed when residents objected. In
2001, lawmakers abolished the state's Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Authority.

Although no specific site or company is named in the bill, the
front-runner is Houston-based Waste Control Specialists, which
operates a hazardous waste dump in western Andrews County northwest of
Midland. Backers of the legislation say that the location is among the
few in Texas considered ideal because there are no flooding or ground
water issues.

Erin Rogers of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club called the
bill "a recipe for environmental disaster and a windfall for one
company."

HOME: VOL.22 NO.37: NEWS: TEXAS WANTS NUKE WASTE

Texas Wants Nuke Waste
BY MICHAEL KING

May 16, 2003:

On May 7 the Texas Senate passed HB 1567, the nuclear-waste dump bill that,
if finally permitted, will enable not one but two private nuke-waste
storage facilities, most likely at Waste Control Specialists' sites in
Andrews Co. Presuming the House ever returns to session, the revised bill
is expected to be quickly approved and sent to the governor. Harold Simmons
of WCS has long been one of Gov. Rick Perry's most lucrative and loyal
financial supporters (more than $400,000 in cumulative campaign
contributions), and there is no doubt the governor will sign the bill.
However, bill sponsor Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, insisted the bidding
will be open and WCS will not necessarily win the contract.

A nuclear-waste dump was originally proposed for a site in Sierra Blanca,
in Hudspeth Co., several years ago, and the state created an agency -- the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority -- to oversee that
project, which was abandoned in 1998 after years of controversy. That dump,
which under HB 1567 is basically being relocated to Andrews Co., would have
held only low-level waste from Texas, Maine, and Vermont -- primarily
decommissioned power-plant material and a small amount of waste generated
by nuclear-medicine facilities. Maine has since moved to leave the
three-state compact, and in the meantime privateers like Simmons have
concluded that there isn't enough money to be made under the original
compact limits.

Hence a second dump, which is proposed to accept U.S. Dept. of Energy waste
(including that from nuclear-weapons manufacture) from all 50 states. Sen.
Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, initially succeeded in amending the bill to cap
transfers to the dump at 1.3 million cubic yards, but Bivins (whose
district includes Andrews) insisted the dump would not be financially
viable with that limitation. Over Duncan's protests that a higher limit
would make Texas "the dumping ground of the United States and the world,"
Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, successfully offered a compromise of 6
million cubic yards.

The Senate rejected several other amendments aimed at improving the safety
of transport and storage of the waste. If the House approves Senate
amendments, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will oversee
permitting and licensing of the dump. The TCEQ's predecessor agency ended
up pulling the plug on Sierra Blanca (where, among other problems, the
proposed site sat on an earthquake fault), and rad-waste dump opponents
hope to have some effect on the TCEQ permitting process for the Andrews
sites. Meanwhile, Erin Rogers of the Sierra Club called the bill "a recipe
for environmental disaster."

WIPP on list to someday make nukes
By Julie Breaux
Odessa American

The Department of Energy's Waste Isolation Pilot Project in Carlsbad,
N.M., is one of five potential sites of a nuclear weapons-related
production facility, the mayor of Carlsbad says.

"Carlsbad made the short list because of WIPP," said Mayor Bob Forest.

WIPP, located about 10 miles southwest of Carlsbad, is the
government's underground repository for all items used to make nuclear
bombs -  gloves, tools, equipment and the like. said Jay Lees, WIPP
spokesperson. The items are stored in long, wide rooms carved out of a
salt cavern located several thousand feet below ground.

If it's chosen, WIPP would be the site of a facility estimated to cost
between $2 billion and $4 billion to build. It would be called a
"modern pit facility," where plutonium triggers, or "pits," for
nuclear bombs would be made, Forest said.

"We took the WIPP site when no other town wanted it, and now that
we're successful, it's given (DOE) the green light to refurbish the
pits," Forest said. The pits, key components in the chain reaction
that triggers nuclear bombs, are temporarily being manufactured at Los
Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., until the Energy
Department finds a site for a much larger, permanent facility, Forest
said.

The other sites being considered are:

- Los Alamos
- Pantex, north of Amarillo
- Nevada Test site, northwest of Las Vegas
- Savannah River Site, south of Aiken, S.C.

Forest said the facility would employ about 1,500 people.

The DOE's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near Denver manufactured
plutonium triggers until 1989.

The facility was closed in 1992 after a government investigation found
that plutonium, uranium and other toxic materials were secretly
released from the plant in the Denver area.

Bryan Wilkes, spokesperson for the Energy Department's National
Nuclear Security Administration, said the closure of Rocky Flats in
the early 1990s made it imperative to build another
trigger-manufacturing facility.

The NNSA is responsible for the assembly and disassembly of the
nation's nuclear weapons as part of its Stockpile Stewardship and
Management program.

The stewardship program was created after the United States in October
1992 unilaterally and voluntarily stopped testing nuclear weapons
underground, Wilkes said.

Today, to ensure the reliability of the nation's nuclear arsenal, the
NNSA removes weapons from the stockpile, disassembles them, makes
repairs and replaces the plutonium triggers if and when necessary,
Wilkes said.

"We need the ability to replace that plutonium," Wilkes said. "If we
don't put back a weapon in the stockpile that we take out, then what
we're doing is a slow, unilateral disarmament."

If the WIPP site is chosen, the triggers would be transported to the
Pantex plant in the Texas Panhandle for final assembly in nuclear
bombs, Forest said.

Forest said an overwhelming majority of Carlsbad residents support the
project. Carlsbad has been suffering from the steady decline of oil
and gas production, a foundation of its economy.

"The key to any city growing is you've got to have some good jobs,"
Forest said.

The DOE WIPP site offers "good jobs, good benefits and great job
security," Forest said, adding that he expects no less from the pit
facility.

Forest said he thought the WIPP site would complement a
trigger-manufacturing plant.

"Here in Carlsbad, we get the waste regardless, so we might as well
get the good part of the project."

Neil McDonald, director of economic development for the Odessa Chamber
of Commerce, said he would support the project, "given all the
safeguards that would go into a federal project of that magnitude."

Because of the size of the pit facility, McDonald said the economic
benefits might spill over into Odessa, itself a mid- to
heavy-manufacturing center.

Cover Study of Nature Provides Startling New Evidence that Only 10% of
All Large Fish are Left in Global Ocean

90 % of All Large Fish Including Tuna, Marlin, Swordfish, Sharks, Cod
and Halibut are Gone Leading Scientists Say Need to Attempt Restoration
on a Global Scale is Urgent The cover story of the May 15th issue of the
international journal Nature reveals that we have only 10% of all large
fish- both open ocean species including tuna, swordfish, marlin and the
large groundfish such as cod, halibut, skates and flounder- left in the
sea. Most strikingly, the study shows that industrial fisheries take
only ten to fifteen years to grind any new fish community they encounter
to one tenth of what it was before.

"From giant blue marlin to mighty bluefin tuna, and from tropical
groupers to Antarctic cod, industrial fishing has scoured the global
ocean. There is no blue frontier left," says lead author Ransom Myers, a
world-leading fisheries biologist based at Dalhousie University in
Canada. "Since 1950, with the onset of industrialized fisheries, we have
rapidly reduced the resource base to less than 10% - not just in some
areas, not just for some stocks, but for entire communities of these
large fish species from the tropics to the poles."

This study not only confirms the bad news emerging from individual
fisheries showing that species like cod can be fished below recovery,
but it also reveals a grim global mosaic that demands immediate action.
"The impact we have had on ocean ecosystems has been vastly
underestimated," says co-author Boris Worm of Dalhousie University and
the University of Kiel in Germany. "These are the megafauna, the big
predators of the sea, and the species we most value. Their depletion not
only threatens the future of these fish and the fishers that depend on
them, it could also bring about a complete re-organization of ocean
ecosystems, with unknown global consequences."

Taking 10 years to assemble data sets representing all major fisheries
in the world, the authors constructed trajectories of biomass and
composition of large predatory fish communities from four continental
shelves and nine oceanic systems, from the beginning of exploitation to
the present. For shelf ecosystems they used data from standardized
research trawl surveys to track the decline in the populations of large
fishes.

Most surprising are the new discoveries from oceanic systems where
people have presumed there are still untapped reservoirs of large fish.
To measure the decline in open ocean ecosystems, the researchers gained
access to Japanese longlining data. Pelagic longlines are the most
widespread fishing gear, and the Japanese fleet the most widespread
longline operation, covering all oceans except the circumpolar seas.
Longlines catch a wide range of species in a consistent way over vast
areas. "Whereas longlines used to catch 10 fish per 100 hooks, now they
are lucky to catch one," says Myers.

"The longlining data tell a story we have not heard before. It is
coherent and consistent throughout, and it comes from a single source,"
says Daniel Pauly, a world-renowned fisheries scientist from the
University of British Columbia. "It shows how Japanese longlining has
expanded globally. It is like a hole burning through paper. As the hole
expands, the edge is where the fisheries concentrate until there is
nowhere left to go. Because longlining technology has improved, the
authors' estimates are conservative. If the catch rate has dropped by a
factor of ten and the technology has improved, the declines are even
greater than they are saying."

Shocking Results Are Hard to Accept

Myers and Worm sent their findings to many of the top fisheries
scientists in the world for review. "We found there was acceptance of
the overall pattern of rapid depletion of communities, but there was
more controversy when it came to the current status of individual
species, particularly with respect to tuna," says Myers.
"Understandably, some fisheries managers find it very hard to accept."

"This is because we have forgotten what we used to have," says Jeremy
Jackson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. "We had oceans full
of heroic fish - literally sea monsters. People used to harpoon
three-meter long swordfish in rowboats. Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea
was for real."

Myers and Worm observe that the tendency in fisheries biology to use
only the most recent data increases the problem of shifting baselines.
These great fish are not only declining in numbers, but with intense
fishing pressure they can never attain the sizes they once did. "Where
detailed data are available we see that the average size of these top
predators is only one fifth to one half of what is used to be. The few
blue marlin today reach one fifth of the weight they once had. In many
cases, the fish caught today are under such intense fishing pressure,
they never even have the chance to reproduce," says Myers.

This is something Ransom Myers has seen before. He was one of the
leading Canadian scientists who fought hard to save the cod. In the
1980's Myers was a fisheries biologist with the Department of Fisheries
and Oceans in Newfoundland. "No one understood how fast the decline
happened at the end- it was only a couple of years," says Myers. "The
quotas had been too high. They refused to slow down because they had
seen lots of little fish coming in- a good year class. The little fish
were caught and discarded and there was no future."

Global Implications Require International Collaboration

Myers' most recent findings raise critical questions at a much larger
scale. "This isn't about just about one species," he says. "The
sustainability of fisheries is being severely compromised worldwide." At
the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, 192 Nations
called on the global community to restore world fisheries stocks to
levels that can provide maximum sustainable yield by 2015. The authors
of this comprehensive new study say their results provide the "missing
baseline" needed to restore fisheries and marine ecosystems to healthy
levels.

"Numbers dropped fastest during the first years, as fisheries moved into
new areas," says Worm, "often before any fisheries management protocols
were in place- and before anyone was looking." Without this baseline
information, most scientists and managers are hardly aware of the
profound magnitude of change that took place at the beginning of almost
every major fishery. As a result, managers today are working hard to
stabilize the last 10%- often unaware that the virgin biomass of their
fishery was once ten times greater. But there is some good news too: "In
most regions we saw increases in faster-growing species which seemed to
fill in for overfished stocks. This points to the recovery potential for
the community at large," Worm says. "But unfortunately we often switch
fishing pressure to species that are doing well, and drive them down in
turn. This sabotages recovery."

The solution to this global problem is simple, say the scientists, yet
it is extremely hard to do in practice. Recovery requires overall
reduction of fishing mortality (the percentage of fish killed each
year). This includes reducing quotas, reducing overall effort, cutting
subsidies, reducing bycatch and creating networks of marine reserves.
Myers argues, "A minimum reduction of 50% of fishing mortality may be
necessary to avoid further declines of particularly sensitive species."
He further emphasizes, "If stocks were restored to higher abundance, we
could get just as much fish out of the ocean by putting in only 1/3 to
1/10 of the effort. It would be difficult for fishermen initially- but
they will see the gains in the long run."

This may sound drastic, but consider a world where tuna, sharks and
swordfish, are merely memories. "We are in massive denial and continue
to bicker over the last shrinking numbers of survivors, employing
satellites and sensors to catch the last fish left," says Myers. "We
have to understand how close to extinction some of these populations
really are. And we must act now, before they have reached the point of
no return. I want there to be hammerhead sharks and bluefin tuna around
when my five-year-old son grows up. If present fishing levels persist,
these great fish will go the way of the dinosaurs."

A DOCTOR'S JOURNAL
Navajo Miners Battle a Deadly Legacy of Yellow Dust
By BEN DAITZ, M.D.

CROWNPOINT, N.M. -  I drove west across an ocher sagebrush plain,
past pinto ponies grazing next to a Pentecostal revival tent, past
the ribbed, rutted dirt road that leads north to Chaco Canyon, the
sacred, ancestral home of the Anasazi, the ancient ones.

I was on the eastern edge of the vast Navajo Reservation, heading
toward Crownpoint, a Navajo community of almost 3,000 people astride
the Continental Divide about 100 miles northwest of Albuquerque. It
is the administrative and educational hub of the Eastern Navajo
Agency and the site of the Indian Health Service Hospital.

The Crownpoint I.H.S. hospital serves more than 20,000 Navajo who
live in small communities and isolated traditional hogans across the
high desert of northwestern New Mexico. I was driving to the
Crownpoint Hospital to meet my good friend John Fogarty, a medical
officer in the Indian Health Service. The Navajo in these parts call
John the uranium doctor.

The Din (pronounced dee-NAY) or "the People," as the Navajo call
themselves, have many stories about their origins. One says that as
they emerged from the fourth world into the fifth and present world,
they were given the choice of two yellow powders. One yellow powder
was corn pollen, and that was the one they chose.

The other was the color of the dust that seems to give this land its
golden hue, dust the color of yellowcake, the uranium oxide that
fueled the nuclear age. So much yellowcake lies below the surface
that a mining executive called this place the Saudi Arabia of
uranium.

The Spirits said it had to be left alone. But from the late 1940's
through the mid-80's, yellowcake was picked and shoveled and blasted
and hauled in open-bed trucks, and then dried in mountainous piles
at multiple sites in the American West. The Navajo, whose lands
extend over western New Mexico, eastern Arizona and southern Utah,
were at the epicenter of the uranium-mining boom, and thousands of
Navajos worked in the mines. More than 1,000 abandoned mine shafts
remain on Navajo land.

The consequences are measured today, decades after the mines closed,
in continuing health problems and degraded land.

Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, people
exposed to radiation through uranium mining and milling or through
weapons testing are eligible for government compensation.

On that recent day, Dr. Fogarty and Dr. Bruce Strumminger were
conducting a clinic for former Navajo uranium miners, most in their
70's and 80's. Dr. Strumminger, also a physician for the Indian
Health Service, is medical director of the Radiation Exposure
Screening Education Program at the health service hospital in
Shiprock, N.M., 100 miles northwest of Crownpoint. He told me that
four uranium miners' health clinics screened 3,000 to 4,000 miners
in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.

More than 500 uranium miners died of lung cancer from 1950 to 1990.
Hundreds more will die of lung cancer in the coming years, a study
by the Public Health Service predicts. A majority of the deaths
stemmed from exposure to radiation from the breakdown of uranium
products. These so-called radon daughters attach to dust particles,
and when workers inhale the dust, the particles lodge in their
lungs, where they release high doses of radiation.

Navajo uranium miners run a risk of developing lung cancer that is
28 times as great as those Navajos not exposed to uranium, according
to a study in The Journal of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine.

Thomas Desiderio was the first patient of the day. Mr. Desiderio,
75, handsome with short-cropped gray hair, wore jeans, a Western
shirt and a big smile. His wife sat by his side in her wide pleated
Navajo skirt, her hair coiled in a bun at her neck.

The Desiderios are accompanied by Trudy James, a caseworker with Dr.
Strumminger's clinic, who is a patient's advocate and a translator.
Like many Navajos in the Eastern Agency, the Desiderios do not speak
English well, and the clinic doctors' questions are interpreted and
reinterpreted in their complex sonorous language, which was used as
a secret code in World War II.

The miners' compensation is determined by their health status and
work histories, how long they worked underground and where. They
fill out 22-page applications.

Mr. Desiderio tells us he worked off and on in the mines from 1953
to 1981 in a variety of jobs. Many miners worked in "dog holes,"
primitive tunnels with no ventilation that men crawled through to
dig uranium ore by hand. "Mom-and-pop operations," Dr. Strumminger
calls them.

The larger mines were frequently no better, with substandard
ventilation, no face masks for workers and little or no information
or education about the long-term health risks.

Mr. Desiderio's overall exposure has been calculated at 94
working-level months; 40 is the minimum for compensation. The
physicians listened to his heart and lungs, working down his chest
with dual stethoscopes. "How far can you walk without getting short
of breath?" Dr. Fogarty asked.

Ms. James translated the question and the reply. Mr. Desiderio said
he could walk 30 miles in elk hunting season. His wife said he had
to stop every 10 feet to catch his breath.

Mr. Desiderio has not yet qualified for the $150,000 compensation.
Although his blood oxygen concentration is low, showing some lung
damage, his last chest X-ray did not show enough chronic changes in
his lungs to support his claim fully.

"Why is this taking so long?" Mr. Desiderio finally asked in broken
English. "Why haven't we been paid?"

The doctors will order a special X-ray, to be read by a radiologist
trained to interpret the subtle changes of pneumoconiosis, the
chronic nonmalignant respiratory disease common to underground
miners who inhale rock dust. The death rate among Navajo miners from
respiratory diseases like pneumoconiosis and emphysema is also
extremely high, about the same as the death rate from lung cancer.

The next patient, John James, 67, started mining underground in 1956
in Moab, Utah. Then he went to Ambrosia Lake, N.M., and on to the
Homestake mine in Grants, N.M.

"We brought dust home on our clothes," he told the doctors. "We
contaminated our families. I saw the yellowcake there. It looked
like it was burning."

"He means glowing," said Ms. James, who is not related.

Mr. James is on home oxygen. He said that two weeks ago he coughed
up some blood. Dr. Strumminger ordered a chest X-ray and drew an
arterial blood gas to check the oxygen-carrying capacity. He said
Mr. James's arterial blood gas result plus the chronic disease
changes on his chest X-ray would probably qualify him for
compensation.

The doctors saw six patients that morning. Most of the old miners
drove at least 100 miles to get there, and they will keep returning
for testing, betting that the sad chapter of their past will somehow
compensate them for the present, before they die.

No one is mining uranium here now. But Dr. Fogarty and Dr.
Strumminger are worried about plans to resume it.

Hydro Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Uranium Resources Inc. of
Dallas, wants to begin a new mining effort in Crownpoint and nearby
Church Rock using a process called in situ leach mining. In the
process, a mixture of water, dissolved oxygen and sodium bicarbonate
is pumped deep into underground uranium beds. The mixture dissolves
uranium, and when the liquid is pumped back to the surface, the
uranium can be removed, dried and processed.

The water for the leaching would come from the Westwater Canyon
Aquifer under Crownpoint, the sole source of drinking water for
Crownpoint and its surrounding area.

Hydro Resources plans to provide uranium for the nuclear power
industry, create jobs and leave the aquifer safe for drinking.

But Dr. Fogarty and Dr. Strumminger are worried. Dr. Fogarty wrote
his thesis for his master's in public health on the health risks of
uranium mining. Underground mining led to lung disease, he said, but
if leach mining pollutes the aquifer, a result may be widespread
kidney disease.

"The Navajo are more vulnerable to the toxic kidney effects of
uranium," he said, "because they already have three times the
national rates of diabetes and kidney disease."

When he heard about the leaching plan, Mitchell Capitan, a former
mining technician, became an opponent. Mr. Capitan is president of
the Crownpoint chapter of the Eastern Navajo Agency, the Navajo
equivalent of a mayor, and he founded Endaum, Eastern Navajo Din
Against Uranium Mining.

"The aquifer right underneath us provides water for 15,000 people,"
he said, standing on an outcrop on the western edge of Crownpoint.
He pointed to the leaching site and said:

"People come here from all over these parts, from 50 miles away, to
truck this water back to their houses, to drink it, because it's the
only pure supply. Their own water is bad -  contaminated."

Later, Mr. Capitan made his case to a gathering in the cafeteria of
the Crownpoint elementary school. The cafeteria walls were painted
with scenes of sheepherders and red rock mesas, with hawks floating
above.

The occasion was the opening of the Water Is Life conference,
sponsored by Endaum. A woman gently waving a sage incense bundle
circulated through the audience. Old women in traditional velvet
skirts and turquoise pendants and young Navajo men and women, about
100 people from all over the reservation, were there to talk about
the future of water in their high desert environment.

The unemployment rate in the area is almost 70 percent, but there is
little sentiment that mining jobs are worth the risk. Endaum has the
support of all 31 chapters in the Eastern Navajo Agency Council, as
well as the new president of the Navajo Nation, Joe Shirley Jr.

In alternating Navajo and English, Mr. Capitan explained how Endaum
had obtained a moratorium against leach mining -  with the help of
the Southwest Research and Information Center, an environmental
advocacy group, and the New Mexico Environmental Law Center -  until
a hearing has been completed before a judge for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. The groups expect a decision soon.

Mr. Capitan stood under an Endaum banner. In Navajo and English, it
said, "One Mind, One Voice, One Prayer, One People."

"This uranium impacts on our water, our air and our cultural
identity," he said. "We've already had enough uranium."

Dr. Fogarty put it another way: "This decision should not come down
to which hydrologist the N.R.C. believes. When you think about the
history of uranium here, what it did to these people, the N.R.C.
should support the people's health, first and foremost."

Panel Rejects Nuclear Arms of Small Yield
By JAMES DAO

WASHINGTON, May 14 -  A proposal by the Bush administration to allow
development of new kinds of small nuclear weapons has been rejected
by the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee.

In a voice vote held Tuesday night, the committee approved a
Democratic measure retaining a 10-year-old ban on the development of
nuclear weapons with explosive force of less than five kilotons of
TNT. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was about 15
kilotons. Advertisement

The Bush administration had pressed for repeal of the ban, known as
the Spratt-Furse amendment, arguing that the prohibition has had a
chilling affect on scientific research related to nuclear weapons.

In a compromise reached between Representative Curt Weldon, a
Republican from Pennsylvania, and Representative John Spratt, a
South Carolina Democrat who was an author of the original ban, the
Armed Services Committee approved a measure to allow research into
low-yield nuclear weapons.

But the measure maintains the prohibition on development, production
and acquisition of low-yield nuclear weapons. The provision is part
of the 2004 Defense Authorization bill that is expected to reach the
House floor later this month.

"The action in the House sends an important message: that the United
States is not backsliding towards development of new battlefield
nuclear weapons," Mr. Spratt said in a statement.

Last week, a sharply divided Senate Armed Services Committee voted
to repeal the ban. Democrats have vowed to fight to maintain the ban
on the Senate floor next week.

Dirty bomb victims 'may be shot'

JOHN INNES

POLICE could be forced to shoot members of the public to maintain
order in the event of a terrorist "dirty bomb" or biological attack
on Britain, it was claimed yesterday.

The Police Federation annual conference in Blackpool was told that
so few officers have been trained to deal with a chemical,
biological, nuclear or radiological strike that they would have to
resort to "very unsavoury but necessary" crowd control.

Bob Elder, the chairman of the constables' central committee, did
not refer specifically to officers firing on civilians, but sources
within the organisation said it was clear police could have to
resort to firearms to stop contamination being spread by fleeing
victims.

The government had failed to explain how important it would be to
keep the public inside a cordon after such an atrocity, Mr Elder
said.

"This is not about creating mass hysteria," he said. "This is about
the opposite. The public has a right to know.

"The natural reaction from the public caught up in such an incident
will be to get as far away from the scene as possible. This could,
of course, only extend the problem."

In another reference to the possible use of firearms to keep control
of an area, Mr Elder added: "We will be the ones who would have to
carry out that containment and we would be the ones held responsible
for our actions - whatever those may be."

Asked if he could foresee officers firing on civilians, he said:
"It's an option the government is going to have to consider. We
haven't got enough cops trained to deal with full-scale containment
and it's putting everyone at risk."

A spokesman for the Home Office insisted police would not have
powers to shoot the public to enforce a cordon in the event of a
chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological strike attack.

"Police have the right to detain people if they present a risk to
the public," he said. "There are no circumstances in which police
could operate some kind of shoot to kill policy under the law."

Texas Has N-Dump Plan 
By Tasha Williams 
The Salt Lake Tribune 

A move in the Texas Legislature to approve the fourth low-level radioactive
waste dump in the United States could vastly affect the way Envirocare of
Utah operates.

Lawmakers from the Texas House and the Senate are piecing together a
compromise of two bills and could pass a final version by next week. If the
governor signs the bill, a facility could be running in west Texas by 2007.

Envirocare, which operates a hazardous and low-level radioactive waste site
in Tooele County, is one of three companies in the nation licensed to store
low-level waste. The Utah company also operated a hazardous waste site in
Texas, but closed that facility in 2001, president and CEO Dwayne Nielson
said.

Although Envirocare will not seek a license to expand its low-level business
into Texas, Nielson said, the emergence of a new direct competitor for such
waste in Texas would divide, and possibly depress, the market.

"The way it will affect Envirocare is that there will be a new competitor
that can take all levels of low-level waste without any income taxes,"
Nielson said. "So they'll have a competitive price advantage over Envirocare
of Utah."

Envirocare already competes with sites in South Carolina and Washington.
Executives at the Utah company have been bracing themselves for the Texas
proposal for about a year.

Unlike Envirocare, the Texas site will probably take Class B and C waste,
officials said.

After a two-year battle in Utah to ban B and C wastes, which are more
radioactive than class A waste, lawmakers in March agreed to study the issue
-but they did not institute an outright ban.

Class A wastes, which are less radioactive, are already accepted at
Envirocare's Tooele landfill.

B and C waste is only 3 percent of the country's waste, said Bill Sinclair,
director of the division of radiation control for the Utah Department of
Environmental Quality. The Texas site will only take these classes of waste
from other states in its compact, currently Vermont and Maine. Utah takes
Class A waste from 36 states, he said.

If the Texas site is approved, the company licensed to operate the facility
would compete with Envirocare for Department of Energy waste, which
currently is 80 percent of Envirocare's business, Sinclair said.

The Texas site wouldn't pay a surcharge on waste as Envirocare does, but
would be assessed fees or taxes of some sort, said Richard Radcliff, chief
of the bureau of radiation control at the Texas Department of Health.

"We are not lobbying in Texas," Nielson said. "[But] our message would be
that when we have a competitor that has no taxes, that is a set-up for
Envirocare to fail,"

The jobs of the 270 Utah employees of Envirocare are constantly at risk
because of the competition, Nielson said.

Envirocare of Texas has hired a number of lobbyists in the past, said Andrew
Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice. However, Wheat said
it appears as though Envirocare is "ceding the turf" to Waste Control
Specialists, the frontrunner for the Texas facility.

"I certainly haven't seen [Envirocare] in this session or the previous
session as a player as they were in the past."

Because of its desirable location, Waste Control Specialists is the leading
company interested in the project.

Michael Lauer, vice president for program management at Waste Control, said
officials are waiting to see how much radioactive waste Texas lawmakers will
allow before they choose to pursue the project.

"It may not be a viable bill from a business perspective."

The House and the Senate came up with different volume caps for the amount
of radioactive waste they would allow at the facility, ranging from 6
million cubic yards to no limit. A conference committee is working on a
compromise.

The site, which has come before the Texas Legislature four times and has
been debated since 1981, has not only been scrutinized by Envirocare but
also by members of the Texas Sierra Club. Erin Rogers, outreach coordinator
for the Lone Star Chapter, said the bill finally progressed this year
because legislators "were favorable to turning Texas into a dumping ground."

Afghans' uranium levels spark alert
By Alex Kirby
BBC News Online environment correspondent

A small sample of Afghan civilians have shown "astonishing" levels of
uranium in their urine, an independent scientist says.  Smoke from bomb 
blasts AP Critics suspect new weapons were used in Afghanistan. He said 
they had the same symptoms as some veterans of the 1991 Gulf war.

But he found no trace of the depleted uranium (DU) some scientists believe
is implicated in Gulf War syndrome.  Other researchers suggest new types of 
radioactive weapons may have been used in Afghanistan.  The scientist is Dr 
Asaf Durakovic, of the Uranium Medical Research Center (UMRC), based in 
Canada.

Dr Durakovic, a former US army adviser who is now a professor of medicine,
said in 2000 he had found "significant" DU levels in two-thirds of the 17
Gulf veterans he had tested.  In May 2002, he sent a team to Afghanistan to 
interview and examine civilians there.

The UMRC says: "Independent monitoring of the weapon types and delivery
systems indicate that radioactive, toxic uranium alloys and hard-target
uranium warheads were being used by the coalition forces." There is no
official support for its claims, or backing from other scientists.

	Shock results

It says Nangarhar province was a strategic target zone during the Afghan
conflict for the deployment of a new generation of deep-penetrating
"cave-busting" and seismic shock warheads.

The UMRC says its team identified several hundred people suffering from
illnesses and conditions similar to those of Gulf veterans, probably
because they had inhaled uranium dust.

	Bomb damage was widespread 

To test its hypothesis that some form of uranium weapon had been used, 
the UMRC sent urine specimens from 17 Afghans for analysis at an 
independent UK laboratory.

It says: "Without exception, every person donating urine specimens tested
positive for uranium internal contamination.

"The results were astounding: the donors presented concentrations of toxic
and radioactive uranium isotopes between 100 and 400 times greater than in
the Gulf veterans tested in 1999.

"If UMRC's Nangarhar findings are corroborated in other communities across
Afghanistan, the country faces a severe public health disaster... Every
subsequent generation is at risk."

It says troops who fought in Afghanistan and the staff of aid agencies
based in Afghanistan are also at risk.

	Scientific acceptance

Dr Durakovic's team used as a control group three Afghans who showed no
signs of contamination. They averaged 9.4 nanograms of uranium per litre of
urine.

The average for his 17 "randomly selected" patients was 315.5 nanograms, he
said. Some were from Jalalabad, and others from Kabul, Tora Bora, and
Mazar-e-Sharif. A 12-year-old boy living near Kabul had 2,031 nanograms.

	Troops and aid workers could be at risk 

The maximum permissible level for members of the public in the US was 12
nanograms per litre, Dr Durakovic said.

A second UMRC visit to Afghanistan in September 2002 found "a potentially
much broader area and larger population of contamination". It collected 25
more urine samples, which bore out the findings from the earlier group.

Dr Durakovic said he was "stunned" by the results he had found, which are
to be published shortly in several scientific journals.

	Identical outcome

He told BBC News Online: "In Afghanistan there were no oil fires, no
pesticides, nobody had been vaccinated - all explanations suggested for the
Gulf veterans' condition.

"But people had exactly the same symptoms. I'm certainly not saying
Afghanistan was a vast experiment with new uranium weapons. But use your
common sense."

The UK Defence Ministry says it used no DU weapons in Afghanistan, nor any
others containing uranium in any form.  A spokesman for the US Department of 
Defense told BBC News Online the US had not used DU weapons there.  He could 
not comment on Dr Durakovic's findings of elevated uranium levels in Afghan 
civilians.

Uranium plus 
The problem can be summed up as two key findings:

-Radiation emitted by DU threatens the human body because, once DU dust has
been inhaled, it becomes an internal radiation source; international
radiation protection standards, the basis of expert claims that DU is
harmless, deal only with external radiation sources;

-Dirty DU - the UNEP report, for all its failings, deserves credit for
mentioning this. Uranium from reactors, recycled for use in munitions,
contains additional highly toxic elements, such as plutonium, 1.6
kilogrammes of which could kill 8bn people. Rather than depleted uranium, it
should be called uranium plus.

On 5 December, when a friendly-fire bomb hit coalition soldiers, media
representatives were all immediately removed from the scene and locked up in
a hangar. According to the Pentagon, the bomb was a GBU-31, carrying a
BLU-109 warhead.

The Canal+ documentary shows an arms manufacturer's sales representative at
an international fair in Dubai in 1999, just after the Kosovo war. He is
presenting a BLU-109 warhead and describing its penetration capabilities
against superhardened underground targets, explaining that this model had
been tested in a recent war.

Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence, on 16 January this year admitted
that the US had found radiation in Afghanistan (10). But this, he reassured,
was merely from DU warheads (supposedly belonging to al-Qaida); he did not
explain how al-Qaida could have launched them without planes.

Williams points out that, even if the coalition has used no DU weapons,
those attributed to al-Qaida might turn out to be an even greater source of
contamination, especially if they came from Russia, in which case the DU
could be even dirtier than that from Paducah.

In Jefferson County, Indiana, the Pentagon has closed the 200-acre
(80-hectare) proving ground where it used to test-fire DU rounds. The lowest
estimate for cleaning up the site comes to $7.8bn, not including permanent
storage of the earth to a depth of six metres and of all the vegetation.

Considering the cost too high, the military finally decided to give the
tract to the National Park Service for a nature preserve - an offer that was
promptly refused. Now there is talk of turning it into a National Sacrifice
Zone and closing it forever. This gives an idea of the fate awaiting those
regions of the planet where the US has used and will use depleted uranium.

Dr. Doug Rokke- former DA/DOD  DU project director
Gulf War I DU team health physicist

DEPLETED URANIUM: Dr. Doug Rokke, Major, USAR,
former Gulf War I DU team, health physicist and DU Project Director

Gulf War I was the first significant use of DU in combat with at least 320
tons of DU munitions contamination left on the battlefield. During 1995 and
1996, the U.S. Marines fired DU munitions in Okinawa then did not tell the
Japanese Government for over one year.   During 1995 the U.S. military fired
at least 10000 rounds of DU munitions in Serbia followed by at least 31000
rounds of DU munitions into Kosovo and Serbia during 1999. Astonishingly,
the U.S. Navy fired DU on Vieques, Puerto Rico to prepare for Kosovo attacks
in willful violation of U.S. and international law and have ignored adverse
health effects and environmental contamination to avoid liability.

Verified DU exposure adverse health effects include: 
	(a) Reactive airway disease, 
	(b) neurological abnormalities, 
	(c) kidney stones and chronic kidney pain, 
	(d) rashes, 
	(e) vision degradation, night vision losses, and catarcts 
	(f) gum tissue problems, 
	(g) lymphoma,  
	(h) various forms of skin and organ cancer, 
	(i) neuro-psychological disorders, 
	(j) uranium in semen,
	(k) sexual dysfunction, and 
	(l) birth defects in offspring.

Since the Gulf War, the cover-up of adverse health and environmental
consequences has been the objective of U.S. Department of Defense officials
so that they can always use DU in combat. The cover-up started with the
infamous Los Alamos memorandum sent to our team in Saudi Arabia during March
1991.  This memo told us to be sure that we should only report our findings
so DU munitions could always be used.  IN OTHER WORDS LIE! 

A letter sent to General Leslie Groves during 1943 is even more disturbing.  
In that memorandum dated October 30, 1943, senior scientists assigned to the
Manhattan Project suggested that uranium could be used as an air, water, and
terrain contaminant.  

According to the letter sent by the Subcommittee of
the S-1 Executive Committee on the "Use of Radioactive Materials as a
Military Weapon" to General Groves (October 30, 1943) inhalation of uranium
would result in "bronchial irritation coming on in a few hours to a few
days".  

This is exactly what happened to those of us who inhaled DU dust
during Operation Desert Storm and in U.S. soldiers in the Balkans. The
subcommittee went on further to state that "Beta emitting products could get
into the gastrointestinal tract from polluted water, or food, or air. >From
the air, they would get on the mucus of the nose, throat, bronchi, etc. and
be swallowed.  

The effects would be local irritation just as in the bronchi
and exposures of the same amount would be required. The stomach, caecum and
rectum, where contents remain for longer periods than elsewhere would be
most likely affected.  It is conceivable that ulcers and perforations of the
gut followed by death could be produced, even without an general effects
from radiation". 

Today, while medical problems increase medical care is
denied or delayed for all uranium exposed casualties while United States
Department of Defense and British Ministry of Defense officials continue to
deny any correlation between uranium exposure and adverse health and
environmental effects.  They contend that they can spread radioactive waste
(uranium 238) in anyone's backyard without cleaning it up and providing
medical care. Their arrogance is astonishing!

As the Army's DU expert (1991- 1995) my conclusions and recommendations were
that: 
	(1) All DU contamination must be removed and disposed of to prevent
future exposures.  
	(2) Specialized radiation detection devices that detect and measure
alpha particles, beta articles, x-rays, and gamma rays emissions must be
acquired and distributed because standard radiation detection equipment
will not detect DU contamination.
	(3) Medical care must be provided to all DU casualties. 
	(4) All individuals who enter, climb on, or
work within 25 meters of any DU contaminated equipment or terrain must wear
respiratory and skin protection. 
	(5) DU contaminated and damaged equipment or materials should not be 
recycled to manufacture new materials or equipment. 
	(6) All individuals who may encounter DU must complete specialized 
education and training.

Even though Department of Defense directives have required medical care,
education and training, and environmental remediation for years: 
	(1) Medical care has not been provided to all DU casualties. 
	(2) Environmental remediation has not been completed. 
	(3) Contaminated and damaged equipmentand materials have been recycled to 
manufacture new products. 
	(4) Training and education has only been partially implemented. 
	(5) Contamination management procedures have not been distributed and 
implemented.

Today, all citizens of the world must raise a unified voice to ban the
future use of depleted uranium munitions and force the leaders of those
nations that have used depleted uranium munitions to recognize the immoral
consequences of their actions, provide medical care to "all" DU casualties,
and complete environmental remediation. And to cite a famous quotation: "AND
A CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM".  But if the children are sick or dead and the
citizens of the world permit this to continue then there will not be a child
who can fulfill the prophecy and lead us to peace.

DEPLETED URANIUM IN BUNKER BOMBS
America's big dirty secret
by ROBERT JAMES PARSONS, Journalist, Geneva

The United States loudly and proudly boasted this month of its new bomb
currently being used against al-Qaida hold-outs in Afghanistan; it sucks
the air from underground installations, suffocating those within. The US
has also admitted that it has used depleted uranium weaponry over the last
decade against bunkers in Iraq, Kosovo, and now Afghanistan. 

"The immediate concern for medical professionals and employees of aid
organisations remains the threat of extensive depleted uranium (DU)
contamination in Afghanistan." This is one of the conclusions of a 130-page
report, Mystery Metal Nightmare in Afghanistan? (1), by Dai Williams, an
independent researcher and occupational psychologist. It is the result of
more than a year of research into DU and its effects on those exposed to
it.

Using internet sites of both NGOs (2) and arms manufacturers, Williams has
come up with information that he has cross-checked and compared with
weapons that the Pentagon has reported - indeed boasted about - using
during the war. What emerges is a startling and frightening vision of war,
both in Afghanistan and in the future.

Since 1997 the United States has been modifying and upgrading its missiles
and guided (smart) bombs. Prototypes of these bombs were tested in the
Kosovo mountains in 1999, but a far greater range has been tested in
Afghanistan. The upgrade involves replacing a conventional warhead by a
heavy, dense metal one (3). Calculating the volume and the weight of this
mystery metal leads to two possible conclusions: it is either tungsten or
depleted uranium.

Tungsten poses problems. Its melting point (3,422¡C) makes it very hard to
work; it is expensive; it is produced mostly by China; and it does not
burn. DU is pyrophoric, burning on impact or if it is ignited, with a
melting point of 1,132¡C; it is much easier to process; and as nuclear
waste, it is available free to arms manufacturers. Further, using it in a
range of weapons significantly reduces the US nuclear waste storage
problem.

This type of weapon can penetrate many metres of reinforced concrete or
rock in seconds. It is equipped with a detonator controlled by a computer
that measures the density of the material passed through and, when the
warhead reaches the targeted void or a set depth, detonates the warhead,
which then has an explosive and incendiary effect. The DU burns fiercely
and rapidly, carbonising everything in the void, while the DU itself is
transformed into a fine uranium oxide powder. Although only 30% of the DU
of a 30mm penetrator round is oxidised, the DU charge of a missile oxidises
100%. Most of the dust particles produced measure less than 1.5 microns,
small enough to be breathed in.

For a few researchers in this area, the controversy over the use of DU
weapons during the Kosovo war got side-tracked. Instead of asking what
weapons might have been used against most of the targets (underground
mountain bunkers) acknowledged by Nato, discussion focused on 30mm
anti-tank penetrator rounds, which Nato had admitted using but which would
have been ineffective against superhardened underground installations.

However, as long as the questions focused on such anti-tank penetrators,
they dealt with rounds whose maximum weight was five kilos for a 120mm
round. The DU explosive charges in the guided bomb systems used in
Afghanistan can weigh as much as one and a half metric tons (as in
Raytheon's Bunker Buster - GBU-28) (4). Who cares?

In Geneva, where most of the aid agencies active in Afghanistan are based,
Williams's report has caused varied reactions. The United Nations Office of
the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Co-ordination of
Humanitarian Affairs have circulated it. But it does not seem to have
worried agency and programme directors much. Only Mdecins sans Frontires
and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) say they fear an environmental and
health catastrophe.

In March and April 2001, UNEP and the World Health Organisation (WHO)
published reports on DU, reports that are frequently cited by those
claiming DU is innocuous. The Pentagon emphasises that the organisations
are independent and neutral. But the UNEP study is, at best, compromised.
The WHO study is unreliable.

The Kosovo assessment mission that provided the basis for the UNEP analysis
was organised using maps supplied by Nato; Nato troops accompanied the
researchers to protect them from unexploded munitions, including cluster
bomb sub-munitions. These sub-munitions, as Williams discovered, were
probably equipped with DU shaped-charges. Nato troops prevented researchers
from any contact with DU sub-munitions, even from discovering their
existence.

During the 16 months before the UNEP mission, the Pentagon sent at least 10
study teams into the field and did major clean-up operations (5). Out of
8,112 anti-tank penetrator rounds fired on the sites studied, the UNEP team
recovered only 11, although many more would not have been burned. And, 18
to 20 months after the firing, the amount of dust found directly on sites
hit by these rounds was particularly small.

The WHO undertook no proper epidemiological study, only an academic desk
study. Under pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the WHO
confined itself to studying DU as a heavy-metal, chemical contaminant. In
January 2001, alerted to the imminent publication by Le Monde diplomatique
of an article attacking its inaction (6), the WHO held a press conference
and announced a $2m fund - eventually $20m - for research into DU.
According Dr Michael Repacholi of the WHO, the report on DU, under way
since 1999 and supervised by the British geologist Barry Smith, would be
expanded to include radiation contamination. The work would include
analyses of urine of people exposed to DU, conducted to determine the
exposure level.

But the monograph, published 10 weeks later, was merely a survey of
existing literature on the subject. Out of hundreds of thousands of
monographs published since 1945, which ought to have been explored in
depth, the report covered only monographs on chemical contamination, with a
few noteworthy exceptions. The few articles about dealing with radiation
contamination that had been consulted came from the Pentagon and the Rand
Corporation, the Pentagon think- tank. It is unsurprising that the report
was bland.

The recommendations of the two reports were common sense, and repeated
advice already given by the WHO and echoed regularly by the aid
organisations working in Kosovo. This included marking off known target
sites, collecting penetrator rounds wherever possible, keeping children
away from contaminated sites, and the suggested monitoring of some wells
later on. Uranium plus

The problem can be summed up as two key findings:

o Radiation emitted by DU threatens the human body because, once DU dust
has been inhaled, it becomes an internal radiation source; international
radiation protection standards, the basis of expert claims that DU is
harmless, deal only with external radiation sources;

o Dirty DU - the UNEP report, for all its failings, deserves credit for
mentioning this. Uranium from reactors, recycled for use in munitions,
contains additional highly toxic elements, such as plutonium, 1.6
kilogrammes of which could kill 8bn people. Rather than depleted uranium,
it should be called uranium plus.

In a French TV documentary on Canal+ in January 2001 (7), a team of
researchers presented the results of an investigation into a gaseous
diffusion - recycling - plant in Paducah, Kentucky, US. According to the
lawyer for 100,000 plaintiffs, who are past and present plant employees,
they were contaminated because of flagrant non-compliance with basic safety
standards; the entire plant is irrevocably contaminated, as is everything
it produces. The documentary claimed that the DU in the missiles that were
dropped on Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq is likely to be a product of
this plant.

These weapons represent more than just a new approach to warfare. The US
rearmament programme launched during Ronald Reagan's presidency was based
on the premise that the victor in future conflicts would be the side that
destroyed the enemy's command and communications centres. Such centres are
increasingly located in superhardened bunkers deep underground.

Hitting such sites with nuclear weapons would do the job well, but also
produce radiation that even the Pentagon would have to acknowledge as
fearsome, not to mention the bad public relations arising from
mushroom-shaped clouds in a world aware of the dangers of nuclear war. DU
warheads seem clean: they produce a fire modest in comparison with a
nuclear detonation, though the incendiary effect can be just as
destructive.

The information that Williams has gathered (8) shows that after computer
modelling in 1987, the US conducted the first real operational tests
against Baghdad in 1991. The war in Kosovo provided further opportunity to
test, on impressively hard targets, DU weapon prototypes as well as weapons
already in production. Afghan-istan has seen an extension and amplification
of such tests. But at the Pentagon there is little transparency about this.

Williams cites several press articles (9) in December 2001 mentioning NBC
(nuclear-biological-chemical) teams in the field checking for possible
contamination. Such contamination, according to the US government, would be
attributed to the Taliban. But, last October, Afghan doctors, citing rapid
deaths from internal ailments, were accusing the coalition of using
chemical and radioactive weapons. The symptoms they reported
(haemorrhaging, pulmonary constriction and vomiting) could have resulted
from radiation contamination.

On 5 December, when a friendly-fire bomb hit coalition soldiers, media
representatives were all immediately removed from the scene and locked up
in a hangar. According to the Pentagon, the bomb was a GBU-31, carrying a
BLU-109 warhead. The Canal+ documentary shows an arms manufacturer's sales
representative at an international fair in Dubai in 1999, just after the
Kosovo war. He is presenting a BLU-109 warhead and describing its
penetration capabilities against superhardened underground targets,
explaining that this model had been tested in a recent war.

Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence, on 16 January this year admitted
that the US had found radiation in Afghanistan (10). But this, he
reassured, was merely from DU warheads (supposedly belonging to al-Qaida);
he did not explain how al-Qaida could have launched them without planes.
Williams points out that, even if the coalition has used no DU weapons,
those attributed to al-Qaida might turn out to be an even greater source of
contamination, especially if they came from Russia, in which case the DU
could be even dirtier than that from Paducah.

Following its assessment mission in the Balkans, UNEP set up a
post-conflict assessment unit. Its director, Henrik Slotte, has announced
that it is ready to work in Afghanistan as soon as possible, given proper
security, unimpeded access to hit sites, and financing. The WHO remains
silent. When questions about the current state of the DU research fund were
addressed to Jon Lidon, spokesman for the director general, Dr Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the WHO did not answer. Yet Williams urges that studies begin
immediately, as victims of severe UD exposure may soon all be dead, yet
with their deaths attributed to the rigours of winter.

In Jefferson County, Indiana, the Pentagon has closed the 200-acre
(80-hectare) proving ground where it used to test-fire DU rounds. The
lowest estimate for cleaning up the site comes to $7.8bn, not including
permanent storage of the earth to a depth of six metres and of all the
vegetation. Considering the cost too high, the military finally decided to
give the tract to the National Park Service for a nature preserve - an
offer that was promptly refused. Now there is talk of turning it into a
National Sacrifice Zone and closing it forever. This gives an idea of the
fate awaiting those regions of the planet where the US has used and will
use depleted uranium.

Bush Administration Examines Steps to a Revamped Arsenal
By CARL HULSE and JAMES DAO

WASHINGTON, May 28 -  Backed by Congressional sentiment favoring a
new approach to nuclear weapons, the Bush administration is taking
steps that could lead to revamping the nation's cold-war-era atomic
arsenal to meet what officials describe as more imminent modern
threats.

The House and Senate last week approved a series of provisions
sought by the White House and the Pentagon that could open the door
to development of new nuclear weapons. Administration officials say
the changes, which include relaxing a ban on research into smaller
nuclear weapons, would not violate any existing arms treaties,
though that is disputed by others.

These initiatives have alarmed arms control advocates and Democrats
in Congress who say that the administration is determined to create
a new generation of nuclear weapons, potentially touching off an
arms race as other nations try to match American capability.

Critics of Bush administration nuclear policy were already deeply
concerned about the administration's opposition to ratification of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as well as indications from
officials that new testing might be needed to maintain the safety
and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. A secret nuclear policy
document issued last year also suggested that new weapons might be
needed.

Taken together, these actions foreshadow potentially significant
changes in the nation's nuclear weapons policy.

Administration officials say that they have made no decision to
produce the first new nuclear weapons since the 1980's and that
further Congressional debate and approval would be needed to do so.
But they say an enormous nuclear capability to deter a rival
superpower fortified with its own intercontinental missiles could be
an outdated concept in the current world environment.

Instead, they say, a new generation of nuclear weapons may be needed
to destroy facilities that could be constructed underground where
biological and chemical weapons are being developed or stored.

"It is a return to looking at the defense of the nation in the face
of a changing threat," Fred S. Celec, deputy assistant to the
secretary of defense for nuclear matters, said of the push for
authority to pursue a new nuclear program. "How do you deter and
dissuade potential enemies of the United States from doing us harm?
I don't know that we ought to eliminate any tools in our inventory."

Mr. Celec and other officials said that existing, congressionally
imposed restrictions on research were chilling potential progress in
the field of nuclear weapons science.

Linton Brooks, chief of the National Nuclear Security
Administration, said: "We want to look at advanced concepts, not
because we want to do anything in the near term, but so that we can
look at future options. But now we can't do any sort of research
without getting the lawyers involved."

Opponents are not reassured by promises by the administration that
its sole aim is the study of nuclear potential. They point to
position papers, testimony by officials and other declarations of
the need for new nuclear thinking.

"It is unrealistic to think we are going to go ahead and even test
but not use these nuclear weapons, particularly with the expressions
and statements that have been made by the administration," Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said.

Mr. Kennedy and his allies, who in a series of votes last week were
unable to block the provisions that opened the door to new nuclear
research, say the push for new nuclear capacity is reckless and
ill-conceived, given the White House demand that other nations
disavow nuclear force. In a floor speech, Senator Dianne Feinstein,
Democrat of California, called the juxtaposition diabolical.

As it adopted a larger defense measure last week, the House eased a
10-year-old ban on research into smaller nuclear weapons while the
Senate lifted it entirely. Lawmakers also rejected proposals to
block spending on turning existing nuclear warheads into weapons
capable of piercing underground bunkers.

And they backed initiatives cutting the lead time for conducting
nuclear tests to 18 months from 3 years. That could pave the way
toward resumption of underground nuclear testing that was suspended
more than a decade ago, the critics say. The administration says it
has no plans for such tests.

The sums involved are tiny by the standards of the $400 billion
Pentagon measure: $15 million for a feasibility study on weapons
conversion already taking place at national nuclear laboratories and
$6 million for research into "advanced concepts" like a weapon of
five kilotons or less.

The legislation also includes $22.8 million to study the
environmental impact of manufacturing plutonium pits, which are core
elements of nuclear bombs. Though the final shape of the bills has
yet to be worked out, it is clear that the administration will get
much of what it wants.

There is also little doubt that senior officials in the Pentagon and
the White House believe that the nation's nuclear arsenal is
ill-equipped to deal with the post-Soviet world. Those officials
have made it equally clear in a variety of writings, public
statements and internal reports issued over recent years that the
arsenal needs upgrading, perhaps with new kinds of weapons.

The existing stockpile mainly consists of immensely powerful weapons
intended to deter a large power like the Soviet Union, but not small
ones like North Korea or Iran. And it is not adequately outfitted to
incinerate chemical or biological weapons facilities safely, or to
destroy deeply buried targets, officials say.

Those concerns are clearly spelled out in a classified Pentagon
document known as the Nuclear Posture Review, which was provided to
Congress last year and has been obtained by The New York Times.
While administration officials insist that not everything in the
document has been made policy, it provides a comprehensive blueprint
that reflects the thinking of many of the administration's national
security policy makers.

"Today's nuclear arsenal continues to reflect its cold war origin,"
the report said, calling for a new approach known as "the new
triad."

"New capabilities must be developed to defeat emerging threats such
as hard and deeply buried targets, to find and attack mobile and
relocatable targets, to defeat chemical or biological agents and to
improve accuracy and limit collateral damage," it said.

Classified Pentagon studies have concluded that more than 70
countries now have underground facilities and that at least 1,100 of
those sites are suspected of being strategic command centers or
weapons bases.

Conventional weapons do not have the blast force and cannot burrow
deeply enough into the ground to destroy such sites, Pentagon
officials say. While large nuclear weapons might render such sites
unusable, they would also cause immense damage to surrounding
communities.

For that reason, the Pentagon has requested money to study sheathing
nuclear weapons in harder cases so they can penetrate deeper into
the earth before exploding. Many military planners also say they
believe that nuclear weapons smaller than five kilotons would be
good for hitting buried targets because they would cause less harm
to nearby civilians.

Administration officials have also begun arguing that low-yield
weapons might be more effective in deterring smaller countries from
using or even developing unconventional weapons. Under this theory,
those countries may now believe that the stigma of using a large
nuclear weapon against them is so great that the United States would
never do so.

But a less devastating weapon might seem more threatening to those
countries precisely because the United States might appear more
willing to use it, Pentagon officials say. The Nuclear Posture
Review lists Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria as countries
that pose new kinds of threats to the United States.

Democrats and arms control advocates say conventional weapons can be
modified to destroy deeply buried targets as effectively as nuclear
weapons. They say even low-yield nuclear weapons will release large
amounts of radioactive debris.

And they argue that any moves by the United States to develop new
nuclear weapons will encourage similar behavior in other countries.

"Arguments that low-yield weapons serve U.S. interests because they
produce less collateral damage and are therefore more usable than
high-yield weapons are shortsighted," a group of eight prominent
nuclear scientists wrote in a letter sent to senators recently.
Democrats said they would press their resistance when opportunities
present themselves.

"I remember how people lived in this country in fear of the nuclear
bomb," said Ms. Feinstein, who added that the nuclear questions
before Congress merited close attention. "I think the American
people have to weigh in on whether they want this nation to open
that door and begin a new generation of nuclear weapons."

Nuke plant's tiny leaks may have started four years ago
By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
© 2003 The Associated Press

Tiny cracks detected in one of the two reactors at the South Texas Project
nuclear plant are so small it may have taken as long as four years before
they manifested themselves as a noticeable leak, plant officials said
Friday.

"What appears to have happened, and based on the sample that was taken,
these cracks initiated probably on an average of maybe four years ago and
because they're so small and the amount of leakage so very small ... so
minute, it just took really that long for any water to seep down in this
area to be visible at the bottom of the vessel," Ed Halpin, general manager
of the plant about 90 miles southwest of Houston near Bay City, said.

Plant officials Thursday were in Rockville, Md., to discuss their findings
and proposed repairs at a meeting of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

"The real story there is not so much what was found, but what was not
found," Halpin said. "We found no other cracks or anything that would give
us any concern on the other penetrations.

"Everything else was clean."

Unit 1 of the twin reactor South Texas Project Electric Generating Station
already was idled in March for routine refueling and maintenance when an
inspection April 12 detected a tiny deposit containing boric acid on the
bottom of the containment area of the reactor vessel.

The residue was described as about half the size of an aspirin.

"I think our initial inspection criteria worked," Halpin said. "We found
it. It didn't find us."

The small vertical cracks, known as "axial" cracks, were detected in two of
the 58 instrumentation tubes inside the reactor vessel, specifically the
No. 1 and No. 46 tubes. Instruments within the tubes measure the operations
of the reactor.

Robert Gramm, section chief section in the NRC group responsible for
licensing activities at South Texas, agreed no other cracks have been found
so far during numerous tests but that experts are continuing to try to
determine what caused the problem in the first place.

"At this point, several factors could be causing these cracks, from initial
fabrication, possibly grinding or welding defects," he said Friday. "There
could be some stress corrosion cracking going on or even some fatigue.
There's multiple causal factors that haven't been isolated. They don't know
what the true cause is."

Framatome ANP, a Lynchburg, Va.-based nuclear plant services company, is
developing the repairs, which will involve replacing a portion of the
instrumentation tube, Halpin said.

"We're in the process of conducting the mockups," he said. "We'll work
through our repair over the next month. The bottom line is to do it right.
So we're doing some extensive practicing and then we'll get out into the
field shortly.

"It is a procedure that is fairly extensive. It's one that our team will be
ready for, though."

Gramm described the repair as a "half-nozzle technique."

"They basically go in and do some machining and remove the bottom half of a
nozzle and replace it with upgraded material and re-weld that," he said.

While similar repairs have been performed at other nuclear plants, the
difference here is that it's being done at the bottom of a reactor vessel,
Gramm said.

Halpin said completion of the repairs should allow the plant to get back
into operation late in the summer. Gramm said the goal was realistic "based
on what we know today."

"But more information will be coming to light between now and late summer
and it's hard to predict what we might find out," he added.

The two reactors produce 2,500 megawatts of electricity and serve more than
1 million homes in south central Texas. Unit 1 went into service in August
1988. Unit 2, which remains running, went into operation 10 months later.

Repair Plan for Reactor With Leaks
By MATTHEW L. WALD

ROCKVILLE, Md., June 5 -  The managers of a Texas nuclear plant with two
leaks at the bottom of its reactor vessel told the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission today that they were backing away from their top theory on how
the leaks developed. But, they said, they were nearly ready to fix them
anyway.

The operators of the plant, called the South Texas Project, 90 miles
southwest of Houston, also told the agency staff that some residue left by
the leaks was more than four years old and possibly much older. Previously,
they had said the residue was not visible when the reactor was inspected
last year.

The leaks are in 2 of 58 nozzles on the underside of the reactor, which
were installed to let operators push monitoring instruments into the
nuclear core. The leaks were discovered when the plant was shut down for
refueling in late March.

At first, plant managers were inclined to believe that the leaks had been
caused by a phenomenon in which the cooling water attacks metal that is
under strain. But careful examination of the metal found flaws in some
areas that had not been exposed to the water.

The nozzles cannot be fully replaced because they are welded from the
inside of the vessel. The managers' repair plan involves cutting off the
portion of each nozzle that has the cracks, inserting a length of
replacement pipe and welding it to the outside of the vessel.

Leaving a gap between the old part of the nozzle and the replacement part,
though, will allow the boron-laden cooling water to get access to areas
that are not protected against corrosion. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has approved "half-nozzle repair" for some structures at nuclear plants,
but not for a reactor vessel.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a
group that often criticizes nuclear operators, said the two tubes so far
had not presented a major safety problem because they leaked, leaving
obvious deposits of boron, before they could break.

If the proposed fix eliminates leaks but accelerates corrosion, Mr.
Lochbaum said, "the first sign of a problem will not be a white residue but
a loud bang and the rapid loss of water from the reactor vessel."

Washington (Nuclear News Flashes)--6Jun2003

NRC rejects request to revoke Davis-Besse license

NRC preliminarily rejected Rep. Dennis Kucinich's petition to revoke the
operating license for Davis- Besse. The Ohio Democrat requested that NRC
revoke the license held by FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (Fenoc) so that
the company would have to reapply and thus subject its qualifications to
rigorous NRC scrutiny.

But in a "proposed director's decision" issued June 6, NRC Director of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation Samuel Collins said that while the NRC staff
"shares the Petitioner's concerns about verifying the adequacy of plant
operator performance," Fenoc had established and was implementing a
"comprehensive" return-to-service plan. Davis-Besse has been out of service
since the discovery of severe reactor head degradation during an outage that
began in February 2002.

NRC is closely monitoring Fenoc's actions and will continue to do so after
the planned restart, Collins said. Kucinich and Fenoc have a month to
comment on the preliminary decision. The decision and related materials are
on NRC's Web site
(http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/vessel-head-
degradation/controlled-correspondence.html).

Whistleblower's claim is dismissed Labor Dept. backs Davis-Besse's firing

By DALE EMCH BLADE STAFF WRITER

A fired engineer who raised concerns about rust that accumulated on a
reactor head at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station lost the first round
of his federal whistleblower complaint against FirstEnergy Corp.

Andrew Siemaszko, who filed the complaint, yesterday appealed a U.S.
Department of Labor decision to dismiss the action.

According to a letter the Department of Labor sent to FirstEnergy Friday,
federal law requires that investigations of such complaints be discontinued
if a company "demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would
have taken the same unfavorable personnel action" regardless of the
whistleblower's claims.

The investigation was conducted by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.

Billie Garde, Mr. Siemaszko's attorney in Washington, said the decision
wasn't unexpected, and her client may have a better chance to make his case
as it proceeds in front of an administrative law judge.

"Based on the facts, Andrew's role in finding the hole in the [reactor] head
far exceeded the punishment that was meted out to him," Ms. Garde said. "I
think that when all the facts come out, his efforts to do the right thing up
to the day he was terminated were the reason why he was regarded differently
and treated differently."

Richard Wilkins, a spokesman for FirstEnergy, said the company was
"gratified" by the outcome. "The suit was very lengthy - it had a lot of
allegations," Mr. Wilkins said. "We met those allegations one by one and
disproved them."

Davis-Besse has not operated since February, 2002, following the discovery
of a football-sized hole in the carbon steel of the reactor head, leaving
only a thin stainless steel lining less than three-eighths of an inch thick
to prevent a high-pressure rupture.

The company hopes to begin operating the plant in August, but the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission must approve the move.

In his complaint, Mr. Siemaszko claimed FirstEnergy knew at least as early
as 1998 that boric acid was leaking from inside the nuclear reactor at the
Davis-Besse plant and was corroding the reactor vessel head.

The acid buildup, which the NRC believes occurred since at least 1996,
caused the worst corrosion of its kind in U.S. nuclear history.

Mr. Siemaszko alleges in his complaint that he was fired, in part, because
he insisted in September that gaskets on all four reactor coolant pumps be
replaced.

He is seeking reinstatement in addition to back pay, unspecified
compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and expenses.

Austin utility bills to go up Natural gas cost, nuke plant shutdown are
driving up rates

By Claudia Grisales and Marilyn Geewax

AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF

Wednesday, June 11, 2003

Austin Energy, which serves nearly 750,000 customers, will raise its rates
in three stages over the next six months because of rising natural gas
prices and the shutdown of a South Texas nuclear plant.

The increases will start next month with an average 3 percent to 5 percent
increase for residential customers. By January, residential customers will
be paying 13 percent to 16 percent more than they are now, and commercial
customers will see bills that are 14 percent to 21 percent higher.

It's the first time in almost two years that the city-owned utility has
raised the fuel charge component of its rates -- a fluctuating amount that
reflects the actual price it pays for the fuel needed to generate
electricity.

The utility is playing catch-up on the cost of natural gas, which has
almost doubled in the past year, squeezing utilities and customers around
the country.

"We are not collecting enough money for all the gas we are using," Ed
Clark, a spokesman for Austin Energy, said Tuesday.

At the same time, the utility has lost one of its cheapest sources of
power. The nuclear-powered South Texas Project Electric Generating Station
near Bay City is shut down this summer for emergency repairs. Two small
cracks were detected in two of the 58 instrumentation tubes inside the
reactor vessel at the project, which Austin Energy co-owns.

Austin Energy is spending $6 million a month to replace that power with
more costly natural gas-generated electricity. The South Texas plant is
expected to be closed until August.

"We are trying to soften the impact, so we are doing it in three phases,"
Clark said. The other increases will come in November and January, when
electric use is lower.

The utility isn't changing its base rates, which haven't changed since
1994. And there will be no change for the 7,000 customers who pay to
subscribe to the Green Choice program, which uses power from wind and other
renewable sources.

For the average residential customer with an 1,800-square-foot house, the
July bill will be $101.37, up $2.73, or 2.7 percent, from last July.

Austin Energy doesn't have the option of absorbing the higher costs. The
City Council uses profits from the $800 million-a-year utility to pay for
basic services and other programs. This year, the utility will send $73
million to the general budget, plus more for projects.

The natural gas price spike is caused by a national shortage that shows no
signs of abating. In Washington on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that high prices could last into next year.

"We are not apt to return to earlier periods of relative abundance and low
prices anytime soon," he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Supplies are 38 percent lower than a year ago, in part because of the
unusually cold winter on the East Coast. But demand also is rising because
most newer electric power plants use clean-burning natural gas. The United
States produces virtually all of the natural gas it uses, but production
hasn't kept up with demand. The reasons include a lack of financing for
drilling operations and environmental opposition to drilling in coastal
areas and on federal lands.

Gas producers want Congress to pass an energy bill that allows more
drilling on federal lands and provides more tax breaks for drilling.

The Senate this week is considering a broad energy bill that would offer
billions in tax incentives for oil and gas drilling, as well as energy
conservation programs.

The House already has passed an energy bill.

Nuclear-waste site sparks debate 
By Bob Campbell
Odessa American

Depending on your viewpoint, the radioactive-waste repository planned about
30 miles west of Andrews off Highway 176 is either a harmless economic boon
for an oil-dependent county or an environmental hazard and political
boondoggle.

Andrews political leaders and some citizens, the state legislators who
sponsored the enabling House Bill 1567 and Senate Bill 824 and
representatives of the waste company say the site isn't over the Ogallala
water aquifer and therefore poses no threat to the environment.

The Sierra Club in Austin, one of the plan's most determined opponents in
the eight years the project has been pending, says all nuclear waste dumps
leak, and this one is close enough to the aquifer to pollute it.

A Sierra Club spokeswoman explained that the club doesn't believe the
proponents' claim about the repository's lack of proximity to the aquifer.

Tom Jones, general manager of Waste Control Specialists, which operates the
facility, said the 16,000-acre site near the New Mexico border has 30 feet
of caliche over a hard formation of 800 feet of red clay that would keep
any leakage from seeping into the water table.

"The Ogallala doesn't extend this far down or over this far," he said.
"We're at the tail end of the aquifer where fingers of it dip down."

With a permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Waste Control
is already operating a low-level radioactive waste repository, having
stored 250,000 cubic yards of material from the U.S. Department of Energy.
It employs 72 people, many from Andrews.

With legislation sponsored by Rep. Buddy West, R-Odessa, and Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, instructing the Texas Department of Health to accept permit
applications, the company plans to dig an initial concrete-lined hole 1,500
feet square and 75 feet deep, Jones said.

The state health department is the official designated licensing agency
with operations to be supervised by the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality, formerly the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission.

The pit will accommodate 6 million cubic yards of waste. Only 600,000 cubic
yards of waste will have high levels of radioactivity. The waste will come
from the Department of Energy and the interstate Waste Compact to store
commercial waste from Texas, Vermont and Maine. If there are no problems
after five years, the company would be eligible to apply to dig another
pit.

No applications may be submitted until June next year.

Jones said fears that such facilities "always leak" go back to the 1940s
and '50s, when they often did.

"They'd bury chemicals and gasoline in steel tanks underground, and it
wasn't until the early '80s when they realized that 25 percent of those
tanks leaked," he said.

The current repository is run like a landfill with waste materials going
down on a thick sheet of polyethylene plastic and then being covered with
another sheet. The big new repository, expected to be operational by 2005,
will be lined with reinforced concrete and then covered with it.

Waste Control plans to seek a 15-year license, and the Sierra Club is
fearful it will harm the environment, make $100 billion for company owner
Harold Simmons of Dallas and then be left to deteriorate.

Jones disputed that profit projection, saying "lucrative is not the right
word because the state will set our rates. We do expect a reasonable return
on our investment, and we're banking on its being a worthwhile business to
be in."

Sierra Club Grassroots Coordinator Erin Rogers, of Austin, said politics
have been a major determinant in the plan's reaching this advanced stage.

She said West and Bivins pushed hard for an expansion of the limit on
higher grade "B" and "C" grade radioactive materials from 5,000 cubic yards
to 600,000 - a change Sen. Robert Duncan of Lubbock opposed but couldn't
stop when the compromise measure was being decided.

"Finally getting it through was a culmination of the change in political
leadership in the Legislature and massive campaign contributions from
Simmons and Kent Hance," said Rogers, referring to the former Lubbock
congressman and Austin lobbyist.

She said Simmons and his lobbyists have donated $500,000 to leaders like
West and Bivins since 1997, including $360,000 to Gov. Rick Perry.

"Bivins directly threatened other senators, as chair of the finance
committee, to cut off funding for projects in their districts unless they
voted for this bill," she said. "We also know that Hance threatened to find
and finance candidates to run against some of the senators who might vote
against the bill."

Bivins said Friday that "there is absolutely no truth to the allegations by
Ms. Rogers."

Hance said Rogers "is an extremist" and the Sierra Club "never wants the
science to be involved because if the scientific facts are utilized, they
lose.

"I'm not going to help people who disagree with me philosophically," Hance
said. "I'm not going to help liberal Democrats, and I wouldn't expect Erin
Rogers to help conservatives or moderates. The unfortunate thing about this
whole debate is that she and her followers have never told the truth.
They're just sore losers."

Rogers said she's concerned about the eventual effect of Waste Control's
profit motive.

"The cheaper they can dispose of it, the more profit they will make," she
said. "We're worried they will forsake safety for profit."

West Texas sees a waste opportunity

Desperate for jobs, town looks past hazards in nuclear dump plan

07/12/2003

By MATT STILES / The Dallas Morning News

ANDREWS, Texas - Desolate and arid, this is the land of rusted pipes and
oil fields, where pump jacks outnumber full-grown trees.

In this weathered region, where one can drive for miles without seeing much
civilization, people take note when something new comes around - whether it
be here or in the closest neighboring city, Eunice, N.M, 35 miles west.

If it means well-paying jobs, there's not much concern. Bring it on, they
say, even if it's nuclear waste.

"It's not a threat at all to me," said Bud Hobbs, 70, who retired in 1997
after decades in the oil-services industry. "I've not heard anybody worry
about it."

Out here, folks favor anything that could help wean their economy from the
boom or bust of oil and gas.

Andrews is the only incorporated town in the county where a company, Waste
Control Specialists LLC, hopes to dispose of the waste - mountains of
contaminated dirt, building materials and protective clothing from Texas
sites and federal nuclear facilities - at a location between Andrews and
Eunice. Map: location of proposed dump

The company, majority-owned by Dallas billionaire financier Harold Simmons,
a significant campaign contributor to President Bush and state GOP
leadership, runs a 1,600-acre hazardous waste disposal facility just inside
Texas on a deserted stretch of state highway between Eunice and Andrews.

With only a few local dissenters, the company has earned the trust of both
towns by hiring workers and donating money.

Environmental groups, including Nuke Free Texas, Blue Skies Alliance and
the Sierra Club, opposed the radioactive waste dump plan as it moved this
spring through the Legislature, which approved enabling laws. Waste Control
Specialists is considered the leading candidate for a license, which will
be issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The environmental groups, with little local support, cited health risks
from disposing radioactive material and transporting it along Texas
highways.

"This is something that we consider to be offensive," said Ken Kramer,
director of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club in Austin, who fears
that an 18-wheeler could crash into a body of water on its way to the site.
"The larger the volume, the greater the number of shipments, the better the
chances for a problem."

Mr. Kramer's group also bristles at the idea that waste from federal
nuclear sites, such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico,
would be allowed into Texas.

But in Eunice, where the streets are quiet and dusty and overnight visitors
stay at the single-story Oil Patch Motel, residents aren't complaining -
despite lacking input on the issue because they live in New Mexico.

The existing hazardous waste dump employs a few-dozen people. Some believe
more might be hired if it expands to handle the radioactive material,
possibly 6 million cubic yards of it - enough to fill a bit more than half
of the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

"I'm sure it'll have a few drawbacks," said JoAnn Davis, 46, a Eunice City
Council member and lifelong resident. "We live in a more dangerous
environment, and we're accustomed to that."

Great expectations

The waste company, which plans to spend several million dollars preparing a
license application for the state environmental quality commission, says
the Panhandle dump could become a $500-million operation in its first
decade provided it receives quick regulatory approval.

The U.S. Department of Energy has said it expects to spend $200 million to
$800 million to dispose of materials from federal sites.

Company officials, who hope to begin receiving the material as early as
2005, say area residents shouldn't worry.

"I would have no qualms at all about building a house out here," said Tom
Jones, general manager of the 23-square-mile site for the last 18-months,
pointing to the bare expanse of parched earth and knee-high mesquite brush.

Mr. Jones, who worked on a hazardous waste incinerator plan during a
20-year career with Texas Instruments before moving to Andrews, said
residents in neighboring towns would be safe.

He's proud that none of his 70 employees has missed a day of work because
of an on-site injury in two years. His workers worry almost as much about
the threat posed by rattlesnakes, spiders and scorpions as they do being
harmed by the waste, he said.

The site would be only the fourth disposal facility of its kind in the
country.

Radioactivity can range from just above background levels found in nature
to highly contaminated in certain cases, such as reactor vessel parts from
a nuclear power plant, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Some items decay quickly, essentially becoming regular trash. Other toxic
items might be at the site for thousands of years.

'It never rains'

If the material were buried, theoretically it could be dangerous to locals
if rain fell on the hole, percolated in the waste, then leaked into the
groundwater. Company officials say the source is too deep to be affected
and isn't potable. Besides, the 14 inches of annual rainfall the county
receives - less than half the total Dallas gets - is not nearly enough to
cause problems.

"The stuff doesn't move without water," said Michael Lauer, a company vice
president based in Dallas. "It never rains out there."

If the company gets its license, it would end a 20-year struggle by
officials to find somewhere to dispose of low-level radioactive materials
from Texas' nuclear power plants, hospitals, utilities and research
facilities.

The disposal site would be the first of its kind in Texas. Amid opposition
based on environmental concerns, state regulators refused in 1998 to
approve a state-run nuclear waste site in Sierra Blanca, near El Paso.

During the 2003 legislative session, Mr. Simmons hired more than a dozen
well-known lobbyists, including former House Speaker Billy Clayton, paying
up to $830,000 to assure the bill's passage. Mr. Simmons also personally
donated $117,000 to the campaigns of the state's top Republican
officeholders in last year's elections, including $75,000 to Gov. Rick
Perry.

Similar waste

In Carlsbad, N.M., about 70 miles from Eunice, a federally managed site,
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, began receiving shipments of similar waste
in 1999, storing them in deep tunnels carved into salt deposits.

Environmentalists intensely opposed the facility, although most locals
supported the idea. Today, opposition is largely muted.

"It has employed a lot of people," said Lisa Boeke, the Carlsbad Chamber of
Commerce marketing director. "They've always been a really strong member of
the community."

The Texas company appears to be following that model.

Recent Andrews High School graduate Natalie Mosley, who admits to not
knowing much about the science of the plan, said the company's community
involvement influenced her opinions.Ms. Mosley, 18, said she noticed Waste
Control Specialists' presence after the facility opened in 1997 and new
faces starting showing up at school and the company logo began appearing on
softball and Little League uniforms.

Then this year, the company gave her a $1,000 scholarship - for which she
never applied - to defray tuition at the University of North Texas, where
she plans in the fall to study marketing or public relations. Several
classmates received the same gift, she said.

"It was pretty cool that they picked me," said Ms. Mosley, working behind
the counter at her job inside Ribbons and Bows, a gift shop on Andrews'
central street. "I don't really know how [the site] affects us. But it
doesn't affect my daily life."

Arjun Makhijani, 301-270-5500 Brice Smith, 301-270-5500    

Potential Accidents at New Plutonium Bomb Factory Would Violate Radiation
Protection Standards for the Public  Bomb Plant Would Undermine Nuclear
Test Moratorium and Test Ban Treaty According to Independent Analysis 
Proposed Large Plant Would Also Violate Internal Radiation Safety
Guidelines for Workers

Takoma Park, Maryland, July 16, 2003: More than one-fourth of the
potential accidents analyzed for a new facility designed to manufacture
plutonium triggers for the U.S. nuclear arsenal would violate the DOE's
own guideline for radiation exposure to the public, some by as much as
400%, according to an independent analysis of government documents.

In addition, the accidents analyzed by the government represent only a
fraction of possible scenarios, thus preventing any clear understanding
of the overall risk posed to the public by the facility. These
conclusions are based on a review of the May 2003 draft Department of
Energy (DOE) Environmental Impact Statement on its proposed Modern Pit
Facility (MPF) conducted by the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research (IEER) in Takoma Park, Maryland. The plutonium "pits" to be made
at the proposed facility are the triggers that initiate the explosion in
modern multi-stage thermonuclear warheads and are similar to the
plutonium explosive in the bomb that the United States used to destroy
Nagasaki during the Second World War.  Sites under consideration for the
DOE's Modern Pit Facility include the Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) and Carlsbad, both in New Mexico; the Savannah River Site near
Aiken, South Carolina; the Nevada Test Site, 60 miles from Las Vegas; and
the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.

At three of these sites (LANL, Carlsbad, and the Pantex Plant), one-third
to one-half of the accidents analyzed for a plant capable of producing
450 pits per year (ppy) would lead to exposures in excess of the DOE
guidelines for a member of the public.

The maximum allowed exposure to a person offsite under the DOE guideline
is 25 rem, which is 50 times the annual exposure limit to the population
allowed from the normal operation of nuclear facilities.

The most serious accident considered would lead to exposures from twice
to nearly four times the DOE guideline depending upon the site.  The DOE
document claims that once a specific site is chosen, it will then
determine how to bring it into compliance with the regulations. "It is
unacceptable that the DOE has proposed a facility that would violate its
own guidelines," notes Dr. Brice Smith, a research scientist at IEER.

"Without knowing the actual exposures that the DOE will eventually allow
at each location following an accident, it is impossible to accurately
compare the risk they pose to the public."   Additionally, the DOE report
analyzes only a subset of the potential accidents that may occur at an
MPF.

Because the total risk from independent accidents is cumulative, the
draft report offers no basis for determining the actual threat to the
public at any of the proposed sights for pit production .

However, it is not just accidents at an MPF that have the potential for
serious human consequences.

"Normal operation of a 450 pit per year facility would lead to average
worker exposures in excess of the internal DOE recommended administrative
standard at nuclear facilities," notes IEER President Dr. Arjun
Makhijani.

In addition, an examination of the data tables presented in the draft
report indicate that the DOE estimates that over a 40 year operating
period roughly 9 workers will die due to radiation induced cancer.

"This proposed plutonium explosives factory will be dangerous for its
employees," concluded Dr. Makhijani.   The Modern Pit Facility is
supposedly part of the DOE's "Stockpile Stewardship Program" to maintain
the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. But no problems
that would materially affect the reliability of plutonium pits in the
current U.S. arsenal are identified in the draft report or in the
scientific literature. On the contrary, the results of current research
indicate that aging of pits affects neither the safety nor the
reliability of nuclear weapons.

"Given the remarkably consistent and positive findings of studies
concerning the lack of age-related damage in plutonium, there is no
scientific justification for the claim that pits needs to be replaced
anytime in the foreseeable future," concluded Dr. Smith.

"We have determined from our analysis that even the 20 pit per year
capacity that the DOE hopes to have developed at Los Alamos National
Laboratory by 2007 is likely to be unnecessary, to say nothing of a
massive new facility," adds Dr. Makhijani.   In its discussion of the
case for the MPF, the DOE document wraps itself in the cloak of
"classified analyses." In response, Dr. Makhijani noted that "following
the closure of the Rocky Flats pit production facility in 1989 due to
violations of health, safety, and environmental laws, the Department of
Energy assured the public that classified analysis proved national
security was at risk if the complex remained closed, however the country
has done quite well without Rocky Flats for over a decade."  "Given the
lack of any need for the MPF to maintain the current stockpile, the
likely reason for its development will be to manufacture new pit designs
for new types of weapons," says Dr. Smith.

"The production of new weapons such as the 'mini-nuke' and the
'bunker-buster' is a dangerous drift towards usable nuclear weapons that is
in violation of U.S. commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,"
adds Dr. Makhijani.

Dr. Makhijani also noted "it is highly unlikely, given current certification
procedures, that pits of new designs would be mass manufactured for
incorporation into the U.S. arsenal unless they were fully tested." This
consideration raises the likelihood of an end to the current U.S. nuclear
test moratorium and the collapse of the international Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.

The final public hearing concerning plans to construct the new pit
manufacturing facility is scheduled for today in Washington, D.C.

Previous hearings have been held at locations near each of the five proposed
sites throughout the summer.  It is the conclusion of the IEER analysis that
the "No Action Alternative" is the correct choice and that plans for the
Modern Pit Facility should be scrapped.

Impact Statement can be found at http://www.ieer.org/comments/mpf.html

Mining bacteria's appetite for toxic waste 
Researchers try to clean nuclear sites with microbes 

David Perlman, Chronicle Science Editor   
Monday, July 14, 2003   

Scientists are experimenting with some unusual species of bacteria that can
thrive by cleaning up radioactive wastes left over from the Cold War when
nuclear weapons plants across the country were running full blast.

The problem exists wherever uranium has been mined, processed and made into
nuclear bombs. Almost 500 billion gallons of groundwater -- enough to supply
1. 5 million homes for a year -- remain contaminated with uranium and other
toxic chemicals in 36 states, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates.

Another 800 million gallons of waste from uranium mines and weapons plants
lie buried in landfills, trenches and unlined tanks. More than 2 billion
cubic feet of contaminated sediments remain to be cleaned -- a mountain of
radioactive and toxic dirt 2,000 times larger than Egypt's Great Pyramid at
Giza.

For many years, scientists have known about the unusual appetites of some
microbes, including the ability of certain strains to consume uranium and
other deadly poisons. Now researchers are starting to exploit that ability as
a way to clean up nuclear sites, a process called "bioremediation."

STANFORD ENGINEER'S STUDIES Among the experimenters is Craig Criddle, a
Stanford University environmental engineer. He is working with several
classes of microbes that he believes can turn a soluble form of uranium into
an insoluble form. The uranium can precipitate out of the water like sand and
be gathered like a common mineral, he believes.

Next week, Criddle will pursue an experiment at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee, which produced the uranium for the infamous atom
bomb dropped on Hiroshima, killing almost 80,000 people.

The lab has another legacy. "The nitric acid and uranium oxide waste, a
witch's brew, was dumped into unlined pits there for 31 years and then
covered by a parking lot," Criddle said.

The waste ate its way down into layers of saprolite, a claylike rock, so that
more than 99 percent of it is deep in the soil, he said. The remaining
uranium has contaminated groundwater, a long-term threat to human health,
because the uranium is soluble and moving steadily toward nearby Bear Creek,
which flows through the area.

A complex community of microorganisms thrives by "breathing" oxides of
sulfur, iron, aluminum and even more hazardous compounds like the uranium and
other radioactive elements. As the microbes obtain their oxygen from soluble
uranium oxide, for example, they transform it into a highly insoluble form
called uraninite.

At Oak Ridge, Criddle will be working with several bacteria, including
members of a genus called Desulfovibrio, which numbers more than 30 distinct
species.

Heavy metals such as chromium that were used during the bomb-making era also
pose a human health problem. Similar techniques mobilizing bacteria to remove
chromium, a cancer-causing metal, are also being tested in the Oak Ridge
experiments by a team from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, led by marine biologist Bradley Tebo.

Criddle's uranium experiments involve lowering the acidity of the microbes'
environment and nourishing them with ethanol to "get them all happy," as
Criddle says. Doing so encourages them to go to work on the uranium by
reducing oxides of the radioactive uranium and thereby rendering them
insoluble.

Like other researchers in bioremediation, Criddle has support from the
Department of Energy. The agency's program manager, microbiologist Anna
Palmisano, is a former member of the astrobiology group at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, seeking microbial analogues on Earth for
possible life on other planets.

"There are wonderful microbes that could be able to help us," Palmisano said.
"But the radioactive elements that are moving into the water are soluble, and 
to get them out, they must be made insoluble."

URANIUM DRIFTING TOWARD RIVER 
Along the Colorado River, about 200 miles west of Denver, is the small town
of Rifle, whose two mines and mills produced almost 17 million tons of
uranium oxide, known as "yellowcake." When the mines shut down about 30 years
ago, they left almost 3 million tons of contaminated uranium tailings.
Uranium dissolved in the water beneath the tailings is moving gradually
toward the Colorado River. Internet maps warn of the Rifle mill site: "No
well drilling or use of groundwater."

After more than a decade of laboratory work, microbiologist Derek Lovley of
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst has built a field site for testing
the ability of a class of microbes, called Geobacters, to attack the uranium
waste problem at the old Rifle mines. Two weeks ago, he began new and large-
scale tests there.

In effect, Lovley and his colleagues have discovered that the Geobacter
bacteria can live or "breathe" in environments where uranium oxides dominate.
They are focusing on the old Rifle mill site to see if they can reduce the
uranium-polluted water to radioactivity levels well below the government's
safety standards.

The genes of Lovley's Geobacter species already have been sequenced by the
Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., founded by famed scientist
Craig Venter, who raced government scientists to sequence the entire human
genome, and at the Energy Department's Joint Genome Institute, operated in
Walnut Creek by the University of California.

Understanding those genes, according to Lovley, could enable scientists to
engineer new strains of Geobacter even more capable of transforming the
water- soluble forms of uranium into insoluble forms that could be filtered
from streams and underground aquifers.

OTHER MICROBES IN SPOTLIGHT 
Still other strains of microbes are under investigation.
One unique bacterium bears the intriguing name of Deinococcus radiodurans,
meaning "strange berry that withstands radiation." It was discovered by
Oregon radiation researchers in 1956 in a can of meat that had spoiled even
after the meat was sterilized experimentally by intense radiation beams, and
it is by far the most radiation-resistant organism in the world.

Gene-splicers are experimenting to see if the genes of D. radiodurans can be
engineered to produce a new "superbug" that could decontaminate the most
intensely radioactive wastes on Earth -- wastes much more deadly than the
uranium that scientists such as Criddle and Lovley are hoping to clean up.

UTPB geologist: Waste dump plan raising questions
By Bob Campbell, Odessa American
07-25-03

A UTPB geologist said he is worried about conflicts between a Texas Tech 
report on a proposed nuclear waste repository site in western Andrews County 
and state and federal maps that show it standing directly over the Ogallala 
aquifer.

Richard Erdlac, who works at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin's 
Center for Energy and Economic Diversification northeast of Odessa, said 
studies by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Economic Geology at 
the University of Texas in Austin are at odds with an analysis performed by 
Tech's Water Research Institute.

Erdlac said he is also concerned about differences between the Waste Control 
Specialists plan near Andrews and the U.S. Department of Energy's Waste 
Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site, 26 miles southeast of Carlsbad, N.M.
Referring to a June 22 OA story about the Andrews plan, he said, "When I saw 
the article and looked at the maps, I thought, how can it be that this is not 
in the Ogallala when existing maps in the public domain show it going through 
there? There is a definite conflict of opinion here that needs to be 
reviewed."

Erdlac said Tom Jones, general manager of the low-level radioactive waste 
repository that has already stored 250,000 cubic yards of DOE material, has 
invited him to visit the site 30 miles west of Andrews off Highway 176. He 
plans a "walk-over" inspection at the earliest opportunity.

The operation employs 72 people, many from Andrews.

The geologist said the plan to encase 6 million cubic yards of waste in a 
1,500-square-feet, 75-feet deep pit with reinforced concrete raises the 
specter of the concrete cracking due to temperature extremes or even 
earthquakes.

"Let's face it," Erdlac said. "The concrete will break. The natural heating 
and cooling will eventually cause it to crack, like sidewalks. This is 
strictly my own interest. I have no funding and am not seeking any funding."

While the Waste Control repository will apparently be relatively near the 
surface, he said, the WIPP site is 2,500 feet deep, encased in salt to create 
an impermeable buffer between the waste and underground water deposits.

Erdlac also has questions about the exact nature of the radionuclides to be 
stored in Andrews County. A last-minute amendment by Rep. Buddy West, R-
Odessa, to the bill sponsored by West and Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, 
increased allowable high-level waste at the repository from 5,000 cubic yards 
to 600,000 cubic yards.

Jones said he wants the geologist to visit and see the 30 feet of caliche 
over 800 feet of red clay that would keep any leakage from seeping into the 
water table.

He said Tech's Water Research Institute, directed by Ken Rainwater, did a 
study showing the site was not over the Ogallala Aquifer "several years ago" 
and updated it recently for the Andrews Industrial Development Board.

Jones said Permian Basin residents should not worry about an accident and 
waste spill involving a DOE or three-state Waste Compact truck making 
national news and hampering the region's economic development.

In thousands of runs to other waste sites around the nation, he said, there 
have been a few accidents where vehicles ran in front of trucks and were hit 
but no radiation releases.

However, news reports on March 15, 2002, said a tractor-trailer rig carrying 
radioactive medical waste overturned on Interstate 65 in Tennessee. The truck 
hit the Duck River bridge and a guardrail, overturned and spilled waste that 
was carried in cardboard containers.

South of the Columbia-Chapel Hill exit in Maury County, the spill closed I-65 
from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. that day, reports said. The truck was off-loaded and 
towed, and there was no danger to the public or the environment because the 
radioactivity was low-level, Tennessee emergency management spokesmen said.

Jones said low-level waste would be transported west of Andrews in drums with 
lids held by clamp rings and that high-level material would be in reinforced, 
sealed drums that are impact-resistant.

If Waste Control wins a 15-year license from the Texas Department of Health 
after the bidding period begins next June, Jones said, two Texas Commission 
on Environmental Quality inspectors will work there full-time.

==============================================================================  

Hance briefs Foundation on permitting process
(Sunday, July 27, 2003

Austin resident and former legislator and congressman Kent Hance updated the
Andrews Industrial Foundation Wednesday, concerning the low-level radioactive
waste bill recently passed by the Texas Legislature.

Hance, representing Waste Control Specialists of Andrews, briefed the
Foundation on the permitting process.  The low-level waste bill, which had
encountered stiff opposition the last three legislative sessions, was finally
approved in May during the 78th Session of the legislation. The bill,
however, still drew criticism from environmental groups and in the Senate,
where it ultimately was passed after 19 amendments were added in a compromise
between challengers, including Sen. Robert Duncan, Republican, of Lubbock,
and bill sponsor Teel Bivins, Republican, of Amarillo.

Hance credited Sen. Bivins and Rep. Buddy West and staffer Julie Williams in
the House with being the mainstays behind the passage of the bill, which
allows a private company to be licensed for operating a low-level facility in
an arid and low-populated environment.

Whatever company receives the permit will be allowed to receive and dispose
of low-level radioactive waste from around Texas and from Vermont, which has
agreed to pay Texas for disposal of its low-level waste.

Hance said WCS would definitely apply for the permit, which includes an
application fee of $500,000, and will take several years to complete. The
permitting process will be done through the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality, formerly the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. WCS is
expected to have a better than average chance of being approved by TCEQ to
hold the license, which also allows the company to receive Department of
Energy Waste.

Hance said other companies would likely also apply for the license, including
Envirocare of Utah, which had owned land in Andrews County before agreeing to
close and leave the state during a lawsuit against the company by WCS.

Hance said Envirocare is applying for the A and B type low-level radioactive
waste, but not the federal waste, which it already accepts at its waste
treatment center in Utah.

Hance said he felt confident WCS could receive the license, but cautioned it
would not be an overnight deal and would no doubt be a lengthy process. He
said part of the reason is the license has to be written and the companies
applying go through a review process.

Hance also discussed other issues involving WCS saying there had been
dialogue with officials with the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) near
Carlsbad, N.M. regarding temporary storage of some Trupack containers, which
carry plutonium-contaminated waste from various sites, to the WIPP site in
Eddy County, N.M.

Other dialogue is underway with officials concerning a proposed uranium
enrichment plant to be built five miles east of Eunice, N.M., across the
border from WCSâ site. The plant would concentrate uranium ore to a purity
used in commercial energy generators.

The enriched uranium is used strictly for the generation of electricity and
not for defense purposes.

Several members of the Foundation expressed an interest in WCS having a
public relations person within the community to handle issues and education
on projects.

Foundation member Russell Shannon said the company needed to have someone in
the community that is able to communicate with local residents and others
when needed to explain the details associated with projects, like the low-
level radioactive permit.

Others agreeing with Shannon were Father Bernard Gulley of Our Lady of
Lourdes Catholic Church, retired oilman Darrell Jackson, oilman Brad Bunn,
Ira Lee Brannan, retired CPA, car dealership owner Mike McGarrity, and
Foundation president Lloyd Eisenrich.

The issues behind the Andrews waste site
By Ruth Friedberg
Odessa American

A state agency is in the process of writing rules for a private company to 
operate a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility.

Environmentalists are still trying to stop the site from being permitted 
citing concerns about water table contamination, transportation and security.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality should be ready to take 
proposals from companies by next June, said agency spokeswoman Adria 
Dawidczik.

People can comment on the rules until they are brought before TCEQ 
commissioners on Aug. 6, she said. Area residents can keep up with things on 
the TCEQ Web site.

Once a proposal is decided on, about a year from now, a hearing will be held 
providing another chance for people to comment.

Open for business

Waste Control Specialists already operates a low-level radioactive storage 
facility in western Andrews County and wants to operate a disposal facility 
as well.

Tim Barney, senior vice president with Envirocare in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
said his company will decide in the next few months whether it wants to apply 
for a license to operate a waste facility in Texas as well. Barney said the 
company sold a site to Waste Control Specialists and had an option on another 
site near Monahans which it let expire.

Envirocare currently operates a low-level radioactive waste site about 80 
miles west of Salt Lake City.

Kent Hance, chairman of the Waste Control board, said licensing would take 
three to four years.

Texas lawmakers passed legislation this past session enabling a private 
entity to get a license to dispose of low-level radioactive waste, Hance said.
Hance was in town last week to talk about the status of efforts to get the 
license and offer information about it. He said the process of getting the 
license is "very thorough."

The plan

Hance said the company is applying for one permit for two landfills that 
would operate side by side. One site would be for material from the U.S. 
Department of Energy and the other would be material from Texas, Vermont and 
Maine under the interstate Waste Compact.

Waste Compact material would be mostly medical waste such as boots, rubber 
gloves and suits. Some of the waste would come from nuclear plants. Federal 
waste would be dirt.

Low-level radioactive waste can be transported by dump truck (with a 
covering) or by railroad, said Mike Woodward, an attorney for Waste Control 
Specialists.

Waste Control plans to dig an initial concrete-lined hole 1,500 feet square 
and 75 feet deep. Right below the surface is 800 feet of clay. Hance said 
there are also monitor wells around the site and sump pumps that pump the 
water into a holding well when it rains.

The pit would hold 6 million cubic yards of waste. Only 600,000 cubic yards 
of waste will have high levels of radioactivity.

Hance said Waste Controls would file an application in January, and TCEQ will 
start processing them in July. Hance said both sites would open at the same 
time - probably in 2007.

"It'll be up to the agency. Weâll have to prove we can do it in a manner 
that's safe to the public," Hance said.

He said there are 1,550 sites producing radioactive material and 63 storage 
sites in Texas.

Waste Controlâs storage facility has been operating for six or seven years on 
a permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. It employs 72 people, Hance said.
If it got the disposal facility, that number would rise to 150 to 200 
employees, Hance said.

Jobs wanted

Andrews City Manager Glen Hackler said the community got together eight or 10 
years ago to get this type of industry to the area to help diversify the 
economy. "Community support has been very good," he said, adding that a 
number of delegations have gone to Austin to pursue legislation enabling the 
site.

Hackler said people saw it as a chance to add higher-paying jobs to the 
economy. Lloyd Eisenrich, president of the private, nonprofit Andrews 
Industrial Foundation, said the median per capital income in Andrews was 
about $36,000 a year in the 2000 census.

Community leaders approached Hance when he was a U.S. Congressman to get a 
radioactive storage facility in Andrews County, Eisenrich said.
This was back in the early 1980s when diversification became a big issue and 
oil prices were falling, Eisenrich said.

Susan Jablonski, low-level radioactive waste specialist for TCEQ, said there 
is a lot of public interest in radioactive waste disposal. "We're trying to 
involve as many stakeholders as possible," she said.

The opposition

Fran Sage, conservation chair of the Big Bend Regional Sierra Club, said 
environmentalists are concerned about the state giving up a radioactive waste 
license and letting a private company have it, thereby giving up a certain 
degree of control.

Ken Kramer, state director of the Sierra Club in Austin, said Waste Control 
wants the cheapest type of disposal. "Basically what theyâre going to be 
doing is throwing the stuff in the ground and burying it," Kramer 
said. "They'll profit from it and leave the state of Texas and the taxpayers 
holding the bag."

Hance refuted that claim. He said Waste Control has to put up bonds and 
financial assurance. "We have financial assurance from the first day to take 
care of closing," he said.

Kramer said the Sierra Club would prefer an aboveground facility where waste 
could be removed and rendered harmless as technology changes over the years 
and centuries.

"The Sierra Club is against anything nuclear. The key is this is going to be 
decided by science, not by the emotions of people who know nothing about it 
or choose to ignore the facts," Hance said.

Hance said an aboveground facility would make it easier for someone to steal 
material and would be more subject to tornadoes.

Kramer acknowledges that the Sierra Club has a tough fight to defeat the 
facility, but he said the last 20-plus years have shown "it's not easy" to 
get one of these sites approved.

Water worries

Environmentalists have said the site is over the Ogallala water aquifer, but 
Hance said Waste Controls has drilled more than 100 testing wells and the 
Andrews Industrial Foundation, a nonprofit corporation, hired Texas Tech 
Water Resources Center to do a study. Hance said the study showed the site is 
not over the aquifer. He added that liquids would not be put in the landfill.

Karen Keith, Webmaster for Friends of Ward County, said her grassroots group 
is afraid the radioactive material could leak into the Pecos alluvial 
aquifer. She added that the site is actually five miles outside of Eunice, 
N.M., at the edge of Andrews County. If leakage occurred, she said, it could 
pollute the Pecos River into the Rio Grande.

Sage adds that this is not just a local matter.
"This is not just whether one town in the state of Texas wants this. It's an 
issue for the whole state," Sage said.

  'Dr Strangeloves' Meet to Plan New Nuclear Era
  By Julian Borger
  The Guardian
  Thursday 07 August 2003

US government scientists and Pentagon officials will gather today behind tight
security at a Nebraska air force base to discuss the development of a
modernized arsenal of small, specialized nuclear weapons which critics believe
could mark the dawn of a new era in proliferation.

This is a confab of Dr Strangeloves. The fact that the Pentagon is barring the
public and congressional staff from this key meeting on US nuclear weapons
policy suggests that the administration seeks to discuss and deliberate on its
policies largely in secret.

The Pentagon has not released a list of the 150 people at the secret meeting,
but according to leaks, they will include scientists and administrators from
the three main nuclear weapons laboratories, Los Alamos, Sandia and Livermore,
senior officers from the air force and strategic command, weapons contractors
and civilian defense officials.

Requests by Congress to send observers were rejected, and an oversight
committee which included academic nuclear experts was disbanded only a few
weeks earlier.

The purpose of the meeting, at Offutt air force base, only became known after a
draft agenda was leaked earlier this year, which included discussions on a new
generation of low-yield "mini-nukes", "bunker-buster" bombs for possible use
against rogue states or organizations armed with nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons.

The session will also debate whether development of the weapons will require
the White House to end the US moratorium on nuclear testing declared in 1992.

Major Michael Shavers, a Pentagon spokesman, said: "We need to change our
nuclear strategy from the cold war to one that can deal with emerging threats."

He said the administration remained committed to the test moratorium (the US
has not ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but has pledged to observe
it). But he said: "The meeting will give some thought to how we guarantee the
efficacy of the [nuclear] stockpile."

While insisting that it has no plans to resume testing, the administration has
asked Congress for funds for a project that would cut down the amount of time
it would take for the cold war-era test site in Nevada to start functioning
again.

Yesterday, a steady stream of men in summer suits and uniforms arrived at Omaha
airport, to be met by welcoming parties of air force officers and taken to the
Offutt base, 10 miles to the south in the small town of Bellevue.

The lushly-landscaped base, where the gray shell of a B-52 bomber has been
mounted behind a screen of fruit trees, sits atop a labyrinth of high-tech
bunkers from where strategic command is poised, 24 hours a day, to fight a
nuclear war. It inspired the setting for the 1964 film Dr Strangelove. It is
where President George Bush was flown on September 11 2001, when it was thought
that the terrorist attacks could be part of a sustained onslaught on the US.

The place and time of the Offutt meeting is infused with apparently unintended
historical irony. The visitors arrived on the anniversary of the Hiroshima
bombing and the last will be leaving on Saturday, the anniversary of the attack
on Nagasaki. The B-29 planes which dropped those nuclear bombs, Enola Gay and
Bock's Car, were both built at Offutt.

The use of those weapons marked the beginning of the cold war and the first
nuclear age. Today's meeting, many observers believe, could mark the start of a
second.

"This is a confab of Dr Strangeloves," said Daryl Kimball, head of the Arms
Control Association, a national non-partisan membership organization dedicated
to working for arms control.

"The fact that the Pentagon is barring the public and congressional staff from
this key meeting on US nuclear weapons policy suggests that the administration
seeks to discuss and deliberate on its policies largely in secret."

The uncanny echoes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not go unnoticed by a handful
of Catholic protesters from Iowa who have gathered at Offutt to mark the
anniversaries for the past 25 years.

Blasphemy

Father Frank Cordaro, the leader of the protest group, said: "This is an
American blasphemy to life and to God. They are going to violate another treaty
by developing small nuclear weapons. We had made the promise not to do these
weapons, but this sole superpower is just ignoring the non-proliferation
treaty. That's madness."

Today's meeting traces its origins to a report by the National Institute for
Public Policy (NIPP) published in January 2001 as the Bush administration took
office. The report argued for a "smaller, more efficient, arsenal" of
specialized weapons. Some deeply buried targets, it argued, could only be
destroyed by "one or more nuclear weapons". Only by developing these new
weapons could the US maintain its deterrent, it said.

Paul Robinson, the head of the Sandia weapons laboratory, who is attending the
Offutt meeting, believes that America's new adversaries would be more
successfully deterred if the line between conventional and nuclear weapons was
blurred.

Senior jobs

He argued in a recent commentary in the Albuquerque Tribune that "military
strategy is evolving to consider combinations of conventional and/or nuclear
attacks for pre-emption or retaliation."

Many of the NIPP report's authors went on to take senior positions in the
administration, including Linton Brooks, head of the national nuclear security
administration which oversees new weapons projects, Stephen Hadley, the deputy
national security adviser, and Stephen Cambone, undersecretary of defense for
intelligence.

The report became the basis for the administration's Nuclear Posture Review in
late 2001 which contemplated the use of nuclear weapons pre-emptively against
rogue states, to destroy stockpiles of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

The officials involved in compiling both documents will play a prominent role
at Offutt, but scientists and officials with dissenting views have not been
invited.

"I was specifically told I couldn't come," a congressional weapons expert said.

Greg Mello, the head of the Los Alamos Study Group, a watchdog organization,
said: "There will be tons of contractors there from the weapons labs and the
weapons plants. Contractors can come, but Congress can't."

The Pentagon insists that today's meeting is technical rather than
policy-making, but critics are concerned that it is being used to build up
momentum behind the development of the weapons, despite opposition from
Congress.

"I'm suspicious that further down the road, they're going to say 'this was
decided at Offutt', or 'this comes out of the recommendations at Offutt', a
congressional staff member said.

Trousdale County rejected for proposed uranium enrichment plant
August 27, 2003

Trousdale County has been officially rejected for a proposed $1.1
billion uranium enrichment plant by Louisiana Energy Services.

Officials for the international business group will pursue the project
in Eunice, N.M., where officials have pledged hefty tax incentives.
Community support is also strong.

LES announced the decision this morning, ending weeks of speculation
about the project's fate. LES first named Trousdale County as its top
choice last September.

"We have just run out of time to make this work in Tennessee," LES
president Jim Ferland said. "We could not afford to wait for the right
conditions in Trousdale County."

Last month, Trousdale County leaders passed a resolution supporting
tough restrictions on the LES project, including no toxic air or water
emissions and a 90-day storage limit on nuclear waste. LES called the
storage limit a "deal-breaker."

"We didn't want to become another dump," Trousdale County Executive
Jerry Clift said.

The project would have brought about 200 new jobs to Trousdale County,
which still remains a contender for a new state prison.

LES fight over; Trousdale looks to prison 
 
By KELLI SAMANTHA HEWETT
Staff Writer

With yesterday's loss of a proposed $1.1 billion uranium enrichment plant, 
Trousdale County leaders are aiming for a new state prison to bring jobs to 
the struggling county.

A prison announcement is scheduled to come by Sept. 5, according to a state 
Department of Correction spokeswoman, and many county residents are hopeful 
they will win.

"A prison is something that certainly deserves looking into," said Terry 
Sweeton, an LES plant opponent.

Officials for the international business group Louisiana Energy Services 
ended a year of negotiating with the county yesterday by announcing their 
decision to take the uranium enrichment plant to rural Eunice, N.M. In Lea 
County, N.M., $1.8 billion in tax revenue bonds and little public opposition 
await them.

"We have just run out of time to make this work in Tennessee," LES 
President Jim Ferland said in a media release. "We could not afford to wait 
for the right conditions in Trousdale County."

LES spokesman Marshall Cohen said construction could begin in New Mexico by 
early 2007, if all state and federal licenses and permits are secured. New 
Mexico is home to a number of other nuclear-related industries and attempted 
to recruit a LES competitor in 1999.

Leaders from New Mexico rekindled a courtship with LES earlier this year 
after learning about the Tennessee resistance. The official announcement in 
New Mexico is set for Tuesday.

"The public and the political people are 100% behind it, from the federal to 
the state to the county and city," said Eunice Mayor James Brown, whose town 
is heavily dependent on the oil-refining industry.

"We are quite accustomed to living with what is potentially dangerous," 
Brown said.

LES cited restrictions adopted by the Trousdale County Commission last month 
as the reason for moving to New Mexico, but local leaders voiced few regrets.

"We did what we thought was right for the county and Middle Tennessee," 
Trousdale County Executive Jerry Clift said.

Trousdale County became a late contender for the new prison earlier this year 
after leaders expressed an interest in the facility. A similar project faced 
heavy opposition in the 1990s, but the need for jobs and the fear of a 
nuclear-related industry has caused a change of heart among many locals, 
leaders say.

For months Trousdale County commissioners were torn between the prospect of 
210 permanent jobs from the LES plant and its potential environmental risks. 
In July they passed a set of guidelines for the plant that were tougher than 
federal regulations. Key concerns included toxic air and water releases from 
the plant and long-term local storage of nuclear waste.

Trousdale County is about 50 miles northeast of Nashville and discharged 
water would have flowed into the Cumberland River, the source of Nashville's 
drinking water.

"It makes sense where they have chosen," said Bill Rickman, who signed on 
as the county's nuclear expert last year and created the guidelines.

Rickman said the southeast New Mexico site is safer because of the lower 
population in the surrounding areas. The drier climate, Rickman said, also 
reduces the risks stemming from accidental releases or spills.

New Mexico state Sen. Carroll Leavell, who represents Lea County, emphasized 
the local interest in safety.

"New Mexico is not a lax state when it comes to the environment," Leavell 
said. "It's not going to be running loose and free out there."

Middle Tennessee environmental experts are also pleased that the plant issue 
is no longer Tennessee's to address.

"To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, 'Free at last, free at last. Thank 
God almighty, the people of Hartsville are free at last,' " said LES 
opponent Will Callaway of the Tennessee Environmental Council.

For many elected leaders here, the unanswered environmental questions were a 
deciding factor on their positions.

"There was no company in the U.S. that could separate the uranium from the 
gas" for permanent nuclear waste storage, said state Sen. Mae Beavers, R-Mt. 
Juliet, who represents Trousdale County. "It was a pretty easy decision for 
me if they couldn't dispose of the waste."

County supports WCS' low-level permit efforts
(Wednesday, September 10, 2003
Andrews County News
by DON INGRAM
Publisher

Andrews County Commissioners Monday approved a resolution supporting and 
endorsing Waste Control Specialistsâ efforts in obtaining a permit to dispose 
of low-level radioactive waste.

HB 1567, approved by the Texas Legislature last spring, allows a private 
company to be licensed to accept and dispose of low-level radioactive waste 
from sites from across the state.

The passage of the bill was a major accomplishment by supporters of WCS, 
including the Andrews Industrial Foundation, which has supported the company 
from the very outset.

WCS currently employs about 77 people, the majority of which are residents of 
Andrews. If WCS is granted the permit to be come the state's low-level waste 
disposal site, officials believe it would expand the company's payroll and 
lead to other spin-off industries.

The four county commissioners and county judge unanimously adopted Monday's 
resolution of support for WCS, and it is the third resolution of support 
adopted by Andrews County since the inception of the company.

The resolution supports WCSâ efforts to be the state's depository for low-
level radioactive waste within the Texas Compact, which also includes 
Vermont, which will pay the state for accepting their low-level waste.

In addition, HB 1567 allows the private company to accept low-level 
radioactive waste from the Department of Energy and other federal agencies.

"Whereas, the proposed low-level radioactive waste would be disposed of 
pursuant to license and authorization from appropriate state and/or federal 
government authorities as required by law; and whereas, the addition of these 
waste streams added to the WCS facility's capabilities is a welcomed type of 
business within our local regional economy."

"Be it therefore resolved that on the 8th day of September, 2003, the Andrews 
County Commissionersâ Court, meeting in regular session, unanimously endorses 
and supports the efforts and application of Waste Control Specialists LLC for 
licensing for the disposal of Texas Compact and federal agency low-level 
radioactive waste streams."

On hand for the meeting were WCS officials Kent Hance, vice president; Tom 
Jones, general manager; Wesley Burnett, community representative; Joyce 
Orsak, human resources; Mike Woodward, Austin attorney; and Tony Profitt, 
spokesman and public relations.

Hance thanked the court for their support, adding that WCS will continue to 
be a "good corporate citizen," of Andrews County. The company routinely 
donates to local projects, events and scholarships. It's also been a major 
contributor to the Andrews Education Foundation. 

Hance said WCS hopes to be approved for the license from the Texas Commission 
on Environmental Quality and receive the license within two years, which he 
said could result in over a hundred "high-tech" jobs for Andrews County.

The state and Andrews County will each receive five percent of the proceeds 
that WCS receives for the operation, which Hance said should be significant. 
Hance indicated that the uranium plant being proposed for Lea County near the 
state line was helped along by WCSâ location nearby.
 
WCS currently holds licenses to receive and dispose of hazardous waste and to 
receive and store some low-level radioactive waste. It has been in operation 
for seven years and is located 30 miles from Andrews on State Highway 176.
As a condition of HB 1567, applicants must receive approval from the host 
county where the licensee plans to conduct business. 

Other matters
Commissioners also approved hiring the law firm of Perry & Kellogg of San 
Antonio in connection with a lawsuit against oil companies, which allegedly 
underpaid their ad valorem taxes.

Several oil companies reportedly misrepresented their oil values during the 
late 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in the underpayment. The underpayment 
may have amounted to about $12 million.

The court approved several contracts with local health officials in 
connection with services at the Andrews County Health Department. Department 
supervisor Deb McCullough presented the court with a list of several health 
providers that the clinic uses from time to time. 

The providers included doctors Robert W. Garcia, medical director; Brian 
Gordon, Ruben Cala, Satish Nayak, Armand Wiltz, Nagarj Mysorekar, and Natver 
Jariwala. Other health providers included Larry J. Allen, Peggy Thurston, 
Karen Wolters, Nancy Johnson, Darlene Norton, Robert S. Leeper and Kelly J. 
Yarbro.  Also Dennis K. Neely, OD; Robert E. Sears, DDS, Windle Harper, DDS, 
and local pharmacists Jerry Trower, Jerry Jones and Jimmy D. Martin.

The court also approved the purchase of a used 1994 International water truck 
in the amount of $12,527 for Precinct 4. County judge Richard Dolgener 
updated the court on a surprise jail visit by the state jail inspectors last 
Thursday, saying the facility was approved for another year.

New Mexico officials announce LES project
Andrews County News
Sunday, September 07, 2003

A host of dignitaries from New Mexico and others were on hand Tuesday morning 
to officially announce the site for a uranium-enrichment plant just east of 
Eunice, N.M.

The plant is being constructed by Louisiana Energy Services or LES and will 
be located near the Texas-New Mexico border and will produce enriched uranium 
for the country's nuclear power plants.

The project, expected to take about seven years to complete, will likely have 
a large economic impact to Eunice, Lea County and the area, with over 600 
workers expected to construct the facility and around 200 permanent jobs 
thereafter.

On hand for Tuesday's announcement were New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, 
U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, U.S. Senator Jeff Bigaman, officials with LES, 
Lea County, Westinghouse, the Department of Energy and others.

LES officials decided to go with the Eunice, N.M. site because of a more 
favorable economic package and other incentives. The company had been looking 
at a site in Tennessee before deciding on the Eunice site, located about four 
miles east of Eunice on SH 176. 

Jim Ferland, president of LES, said he was greatly impressed with the way New 
Mexico officials had sought the company for diversifying the area. He said 
LES would be a "good corporate citizen to Eunice, Lea County and New Mexico."
Ferland said the project would use state-of-the-art technology and produce 
enriched uranium for nuclear power plants at a competitive price. He said a 
similar operation in Europe had a spotless reputation and had been in 
operation for over 30 years.

Both Gov. Richardson and Sen. Domenici expressed optimism that the plant 
would bring jobs and an economic revitalization to Southeastern New Mexico. 
The project is expected to cost about $1.2 billion to construct and have an 
annual payroll of $20 million.

The permitting part of the project will take three or four years, followed by 
the construction phase. Ferland said permanent workers would be brought in 
before the actual construction is completed.

Invited guests from Andrews attending the ceremonies included Andrews 
Industrial Foundation President Lloyd Eisenrich, Wesley Burnett, community 
relations for Waste Control Specialists, Tom Jones, WCS Manager, Joyce Orsak, 
WCS, Andrews City Manager Glen Hackler, Andrews Mayor Bob Zap, city 
councilman Brad Bunn, Andrews County Judge Richard Dolgener, and Don Ingram,

Burnett named new community rep for WCS
Andrews County News
Sunday, September 07, 2003

Wesley R. Burnett, former director of business expansion and retention for 
the Odessa Chamber of Commerce, has been named vice president for public 
affairs and community relations for Waste Control Specialists, according to 
WCS Chairman and CEO Kent Hance.
ãWesley, who is a native of Odessa, has a strong and distinguished career as 
a civic development leader in Odessa, Andrews and Jacksonville,ä Hance said, 
adding that, ãHe will play a key role for our operation west of Andrews.ä
Burnett will have an office in Andrews beginning Sept. 8. The office will be 
situated where local engineer James Tompkins is currently located on NW Ave. 
C. Tompkins plans to move his office to the old Exxon Building on West 
Broadway, where WCS is currently located.


Hance said Burnett would provide critical liaison with public officials, 
community leaders and citizens in West Texas.
ãHe will be the eyes and ears in the vast West Texas area and will serve as a 
sounding board for anyone who is interested in developing issues at the 
Andrews site,ä he said.
Burnett will also be looking at the economic impact of the WCS operation and 
plans for expansion.
WCS operates a hazardous waste facility and, under a new Texas law, intends 
to apply for a license to dispose of low-level radioactive waste.
Burnett is a graduate of UT Permian Basin at Odessa and holds a BA in 
political science. He has been an Odessa chamber official since 1999. He also 
served for more than three years as president and CEO of the Jacksonville 
Chamber of Commerce in East Texas. He is a former assistant director of UTPB 
EDA University Center.

Burnett started his career in economic development as manager and CEO of the 
Andrews Chamber of Commerce. He will be based in Andrews and he and his wife, 
Melissa, have a son, Caleb, age eight and a daughter, Cayli, age six.

State pushes ahead nuclear waste plan 
September 9, 2003
Rutland Daily Herald
By Darren Allen

Montpelier - Vermont officials are planning to pay $12.5 million next month 
toward construction of a radioactive waste dump that might never be built. 
Under legislation passed 10 years ago, Vermont joined with Maine and Texas in 
an agreement under which the two New Enlgand states would pay $27.5 million 
each to send low-level radioactive waste to Texas, which was to find a site 
for disposing of it. Maine dropped out of the compact last year.

The legislation came in response to a federal law that said in essence that 
the federal government would take responsibility for disposing of high-level 
waste - mainly spent nuclear fuel - while the states would take 
responsibility for low-level waste. Low-level waste presents a wide range of 
hazards, depending on the source and type of radiation, according to 
information published on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site.

"The radioactivity can range from just above background levels found in 
nature to very highly radioactive in certain cases, such as parts from inside 
a reactor vessel in a nuclear power plant," the Web site says.

Vermont ships the lowest of its low-level waste to a private firm's disposal 
site in Utah. The more highly radioactive of the low-level waste is shipped 
to Barnwell, SC, to a site that will be closed in 2008. More than 98 percent 
of Vermont's low-level waste comes from the Vermont Yankee nuclear power 
plant in Vernon, with tiny amounts coming from the University of Vermont, 
Middlebury College, and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in White River 
Junction.

Texas first focused on a potential site in the southwestern part of the 
state, about 90 miles from El Paso, but the proposed Sierra Blanca site 
failed to win needed permits. Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers authorized 
another search for a site, and included in the legislation the requirements 
that other compact states - for now, only Vermont - make a $12.5 million 
payment by Nov. 1. Vermont law allows the state in turn to bill its waste 
generators for that amount on a proportional basis. 

Monday, Auditor of Accounts Elizabeth Ready told the Legislature's Joint 
Fiscal Committee, which reviews budgetary matters when the full legislature 
is not in session, that it and other state officials should ask lots of 
questions before sending Texas the $12.5 million.

"If Texas if unable to cause the site to be built, what would happen with the 
$12.5 million?" she asked during testimony to the committee. 

Ready said in a later interview that she is concerned that Vermont Yankee's 
owners, Entergy Nuclear, might balk at making additional payments if the 
first didn't result in a site's being opened. At that point, under federal 
law, the onus would be back on the state to dispose of the waste she said.

William Sherman, nulcear engineer with the state Deparment of Public Service, 
confirmed Ready's understanding of federal law but he expressed confidence 
that Texas would be able to build the facility.

"It's our firm expectation that they will develop a site," Sherman told the 
committee.

Ready noted that none of the other multi-state compacts around the country 
had been able to build a disposal site, and said some had been dissolved. She 
said environmental groups in Texas were raising questions abou the newest 
proposal site in west Texas. 

Robert Williams, spokesperson for Vermont Yankee and Entergy, said his 
company's only interest was that low-level waste not be disposed of in 
Vermont and that it be disposed of in a safe way.

"Compact participation and payments, and things like that - those decisions 
would be made by state governments," Williams said.

Fun with fusion: 
Freshman's nuclear fusion reactor has USU physics faculty in awe 
By Alan Edwards Deseret Morning News

      LOGAN - A widespread belief among physicists nowadays is that modern 
science requires squadrons of scientists and wildly expensive equipment.
Craig Wallace and Philo T. Farnsworth are putting the lie to all that.

Spanish Fork High graduate Craig Wallace shows off his nuclear fusion 
reactor, based on the plans of Utah's own Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of 
TV.

Wallace, a baby-faced tennis player fresh out of Spanish Fork High 
School, had almost the entire physics faculty of Utah State University 
hovering (and arguing) over an apparatus he had cobbled together from parts 
salvaged from junk yards and charity drops.

The apparatus is nothing less than the sine qua non of modern science: 
a nuclear fusion reactor, based on the plans of Utah's own Philo Farnsworth, 
the inventor of television.

The reactor sat on a table with an attached vacuum pump wheezing away. 
A television monitor showed what was inside: a glowing ball of gas surrounded 
by a metal helix.

The ball is, literally, a small sun, where an electric field forces 
deuteron ions (a form of hydrogen) to gather, bang together and occasionally 
fuse, spitting out a neutron each time fusion occurs.

"Here I am with this thing here," Wallace mused, looking at his 
surroundings. "Who'da thought?"

Wallace and Farnsworth are much alike. Both are (or were ÷ Farnsworth 
died in 1971) tinkerers. While Wallace was in grade school, his mother got a 
flat tire while he was riding with her. He fixed it. For his part, Farnsworth 
began improvising electric motors at a young age. Both went on to bigger and 
better things.

"He was never motivated to take science," said Wallace's father, Allen 
Wallace. "It was really the tinkering that motivated him."

When Craig was a sophomore in high school, browsing the Internet he 
discovered that Farnsworth had come up with a way to create deuteron ion 
plasma, a prerequisite to fusion.

While it was not good for production of energy (the source of much 
embarrassment to the University of Utah in the cold fusion debacle in the 
late 1980s), Farnsworth's design did emit neutrons, a useful tool for 
commercial applications and scientific experimentation.

to USU professors John Raitt, left, and Farrell Edwards.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret Morning News 

"He (Farnsworth) was after the Holy Grail of excess energy, but 
everyone agrees that it's mostly useful as a neutron generator," Allen 
Wallace said.

About 30 such devices exist around the country, owned by such entities 
as Los Alamos National Laboratories, NASA and universities. ("I bet I'm the 
only high school student that has one," Craig Wallace said.)

Looking at Farnsworth's plans for the first time, Craig and his father 
both had the same thought: Now there's a science project.

They set to work. They found a neutron detector in an Idaho Falls scrap 
metal yard. Craig built a neutron modulator (which slows down the emitted 
neutrons so they can be detected) out of a few hundred spare CDs. They found 
a broken turbo molecular pump lying forgotten at Deseret Industries.

Too poor to buy pricey deuterium gas, Craig bought a container of 
deuterium oxide, or heavy water, for 20 bucks and came up with a way to make 
it a gas and get rid of the accompanying oxygen by passing it over heated 
magnesium filings.

Not bad for a backyard amateur who considered himself more mechanic 
than scientist.

"I teased him that he was now officially a science geek," Allen Wallace 
said.

One professor Friday stood nervously away from Wallace's reactor ÷ 
which is notably free from any shielding ÷ but he needn't have worried: 
Wallace's detector measures 36 neutrons per minute just in background 
radiation from space, and the device's usual output adds only four neutrons 
per minute. People in airplanes absorb much more than that.

It took two years of gathering materials and six months of assembly, 
but the final product actually, incongruously, works.

"(This was) the day I achieved a Poisser plasma reaction," Wallace 
wrote next to a picture of the glowing ball. "Probably the coolest thing I 
have ever seen."

Others thought it was cool, too. Wallace began winning contests ÷ 
local, state, national ÷ culminating in second place in the International 
Intel Science and Engineering Fair last May in Cleveland. He's now beginning 
work on a USU physics degree.

"The whole thing combines chemistry, engineering, physics," he 
said. "Put them all together and you come out with something pretty sweet."

Farnsworth would have been proud.

Assemblyman urges inquiry into National Lead site
Eric Durr- The Business Review

State Assemblyman Robert Prentiss (R-Colonie) is urging the Federal Agency 
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to launch a public health 
assessment of the National Lead Company industrial site in Albany, N.Y. 

The assessment would be useful in a class action lawsuit under consideration 
by Albany-area residents against National Lead's successor company, Houston, 
Texas-based NL Industries Inc., Prentiss said. 

The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry recently completed a 
health consultation draft report on health risks related to the National Lead 
site at 1130 Central Ave. In that report the agency said there could be a 
link to pollution on the site and lung cancer and kidney disease. 

National Lead purchased the 11.2 acre site from Magnus Metal Company In 1937 
and operated a brass foundry at the location. After World War II the company 
began casting aluminum aircraft frames there, according to the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 

In 1958, the nuclear division of National Lead began producing items 
manufactured from uranium and thorium under a license from the Atomic Energy 
Commission. Operation of the brass foundry ended in 1960. 

>From 1958 to 1984 the company used radioactive materials consisting mostly of 
depleted uranium. But smaller amounts of thorium and enriched uranium were 
also used between 1960 and 1972. 

The company reduced depleted uranium tetrafluoride to depleted uranium metal 
which was then made into shielding components, ballast weights, and 
projectiles. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, National Lead manufactured fuel 
from enriched uranium for experimental nuclear reactors. 

In 1984 the state shut down the company's operations because of airborne 
releases of radioactive materials that exceeded court-ordered standards. 

In 1979 scientists at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., 
discovered traces of depleted uranium 26 miles away from the National Lead 
plant that could only have come from that facility, said former Knolls 
research Leonard Dietz, a retired physicist. Air filters installed at the 
Navy's nuclear reactor training facility in Malta, N.Y., were contaminated 
with material from the National Lead site, he said. 

While the Army Corps of Engineers is cleaning up the Central Avenue location, 
federal officials need to examine the potential health risks that could have 
been caused by depleted uranium emissions from the plant, Prentiss said. 

He has a list of 100 names of area residents who have unusual health problems 
that could be related to the National Lead site, Prentiss said. A New York 
City-based environmental law firm is looking at the potential for a class 
action lawsuit, the Assemblyman said. 

Prentiss said he could not yet name the firm that was considering the 
lawsuit. 

One of those who would join the class action is Albany resident Ron Russo, 
who is suffering from kidney disease, a rare form of lung cancer, and 
diabetes. 

As a child he lived four blocks away from the National Lead plant and he and 
his friends used to play on and around the site, Russo said. His mother died 
of lung disease and renal failure, and his father died of kidney disease and 
lung disease, Russo said. 

He's convinced that his illnesses and those of his parents are related to the 
National Lead site. 

"They just didn't care then," the 48-year old Russo said.

Vt. must pay for nuclear waste site
October 3, 2003
By DAVID MACE Vermont Press Bureau 

MONTPELIER - Vermont has little choice but to pay Texas $12.5 million to 
develop a low-level radioactive waste dump that Vermont may use, the attorney 
general's office said. 

But some lawmakers want Gov. James Douglas to re-negotiate the deal. 

While acknowledging it's Douglasâ call to make, the Legislature's Joint 
Fiscal Committee voted Friday to advise him to see if he can persuade Texas 
to let Vermont withhold the money until Texas actually has a site permitted. 

Senate President Pro Tem Peter Welch, D-Windsor, the committee's chairman, 
questioned whether the first of two payments should be sent when Texas has 
been unable to find an acceptable site for the waste dump and won't have to 
give the money back if it can't. 

"If the money is sent, and there's no licensed facility, that (money) will 
not be available to pay for a site that might be licensed," Welch said. 

The questions about whether Vermont should stick with its Texas deal were 
raised last month by State Auditor Elizabeth Ready, who said several 
conditions of the multi-state agreement had changed and asked whether the 
state should re-evaluate its participation. 

Ready questioned whether Vermont should make the payment because: 

- The new site hasn't been approved and is under fire from environmentalists. 

- A private company with designs on opening a dump that would take both low-
level civilian and military waste is apparently involved in the new site. 

- The new law could conflict with the language of the compact that protects 
Vermont from liability for the dump site. 

Vermont joined the multi-state compact with Maine and Texas in 1993. Congress 
approved the plan for Maine and Vermont to ship their low-level waste -
contaminated equipment and clothing from nuclear power plants and a small 
amount of radioactive medical waste - to Texas in 1998. 

Federal law says states that build a nuclear waste dump must allow other 
states to put their waste in it unless they are part of such a compact. So 
the deal was seen as mutually beneficial because Texas could deny other 
states access to their dump in exchange for taking waste from two small 
states that produced little waste of their own. 

However, Maine pulled out of agreement last year because the state shut down 
its only reactor, Maine Yankee, in 1998 and found other places to put its 
waste. 

A new law passed in Texas this year sets up a process for locating a new 
site, including by private developers, and demands the first $12.5 million no 
later than Nov. 1. 

Entergy's Vermont Yankee nuclear plant will be responsible for paying almost 
all of the money, with a small amount coming from hospitals and other 
sources. 

Yankee cannot raise the rates it charges customers to make back the money, 
but has maintained that its the government's decision about whether to stay 
in the compact. 

In September, the committee sought a ruling from the Vermont attorney 
general's office, which said the state had little choice but to pay the money 
under the compact, which is federal law. 

The opinion by Assistant Attorney General William Rice said virtually all of 
Ready's fears were misplaced, and that Texas could sue or throw Vermont out 
of the compact if it failed to pay. Rice also gave a glum assessment of 
Vermont's chances of winning a court fight, noting that its defenses would be 
weak. 

"Although we believe that these defenses could be raised in good faith, we 
are not optimistic of their chances of success," he wrote. 

He noted that if Vermont were kicked out of the compact, it would still be 
obligated to find some place to dispose of its nuclear waste. 

That point wasn't lost on Senate Minority Leader John Bloomer, R-Rutland. 

"If you back out of Texas, you'd better have another plan," he told Welch and 
other Democrats who were questioning the deal Friday. 

Bloomer ultimately agreed that it wouldn't hurt to ask Texas if theyâd let 
Vermont hold off on the payment until the site was licensed. 

"The administration believes that we are contractually required to make the 
payment under the terms of the agreement.  However, we will make the 
inquiries the joint fiscal committee recommended," said Douglasâ press 
secretary, Jason Gibbs. "Weâll ask, but we know we have to pay."

Afterward, Ready said she still had reservations about the deal. 

"My whole sense of this is Vermont is pouring this money down a rat hole, and 
it's a nasty nuclear rat hole," she said. "I hope I'm wrong about this, and 
they're right." 

Susan Jablonski, radioactive waste specialist with the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality, said the state is making rules for how applications to 
build and run the site will be handled, and recently took public comment on 
the matter. 

In other business Friday, the Joint Fiscal Committee approved the compromise 
between House and Senate budget leaders and the Douglas administration to 
save the jobs of nine of the 29 workers in the Department of Employment and 
Training who were slated to be laid off. 

Some committee membersâ frustration about the cuts remained, and officials 
with the Vermont State Employees Association, the state employees union, 
continued to call for saving the remaining jobs. But the committee ultimately 
signed off on the plan. 

The administration had proposed laying off the workers earlier this summer, 
saying that a $1 million cut in federal funding and an equal increase in 
payroll expenses jeopardized DET's Jobs and Training Division. They 
ultimately found $300,000 in the state's social welfare department that would 
bring in a matching amount from the federal government. 

"It makes no sense," Welch said of the cut, arguing that with unemployment 
still a problem the workers were needed now more than ever. 

"It's not anything that any of us want to do," said Rep. Richard Westman, R-
Cambridge, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. "We don't have the 
authority at this point to raise taxes."

Des Moines Register
Dean role in accord on waste assailed
The former Vermont governor says he was just following a federal requirement.
By THOMAS BEAUMONT
Register Staff Writer
10/05/2003

A 1993 agreement to send Vermont nuclear waste to Texas has resurfaced a 
decade later in a political attack by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry on a 
chief rival for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, former Vermont 
Gov. Howard Dean.

Kerry said last week that Dean showed environmental and ethnic insensitivity 
when he signed a compact to allow Vermont and Maine to send low-level nuclear 
waste to the largely Hispanic west Texas town of Sierra Blanca.

Kerry's attack comes as Dean's chief rivals in the early nominating states of 
Iowa and New Hampshire - where Dean leads in polls - seek to link the former 
governor with more conservative positions than his liberal stances now 
suggest.

Dean has defended the compact by saying that Vermont was responding to a 
federal requirement that states dispose of their nuclear waste and that his 
state had no role in choosing the site.

A Texas environmental agency ultimately blocked the nuclear waste dump from 
being built there.

Environmentalists in Texas and Vermont said Dean did nothing to urge Texas to 
reconsider the location, despite an outcry from environmental and Latino 
activists and Democrats in Congress.

They also said there was little Dean could have done about the site selection 
because that was Texas' legal responsibility.

"I fought against Howard Dean on this for a long time, but the bottom line is 
the federal government gave states title to nuclear waste," said former 
Vermont state Sen. Elizabeth Ready, an anti-nuclear activist. "Even though I 
unalterably opposed the position of my own governor, what would Kerry have 
done if he had a legal obligation?"

Ready, a Democrat, is now Vermont's state auditor and supports Dean's 
presidential bid.

Kerry's attack comes less than four months before the Jan. 19 Iowa caucuses. 
It seeks to implicitly discredit Dean's claim to the mantle of the late 
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, who called the attempt to bury nuclear waste 
at Sierra Blanca "environmental racism."

Congress passed the compact in 1997 and President Clinton signed it, over the 
objections of Wellstone, environmentalists and the nuclear power company that 
would have been the main contributor to the site. Kerry and Wellstone were 
among 15 senators who voted against the measure.

The compact had been rejected two years earlier in the U.S. House, in part 
because of concerns that the site is geologically unstable and close enough 
to the Rio Grande to pose a serious pollution threat.

As controversial was the fact that Sierra Blanca, a town of about 500 
residents 16 miles from the Mexican border, is overwhelmingly Hispanic.

"People who were involved in the fight over Sierra Blanca considered it an 
environmental justice issue," said Margot Clarke, outreach coordinator for 
the Texas Sierra Club, an environmental group that opposed placing the dump 
at Sierra Blanca.

In 1993, Dean signed the agreement with then-Gov. Ann Richards of Texas to 
store the low-level nuclear waste from Vermont's one nuclear power plant in 
Texas. Two years earlier, the Texas Legislature had identified Sierra Blanca 
as the preferred site.

But Dean, who left office after his term ended last year, said the agreement 
did not specify where the waste would be stored.

"The Texas agreement did not say the waste would go to Sierra Blanca," Dean 
said in an interview last week with The Des Moines Register. "This was really 
Texas' call where they wanted to send the waste."

Dean said the issue doesn't stand out as a divisive one. He signed the 
agreement with Texas, which Maine later joined, after the Vermont Legislature 
passed it. The Vermont House was controlled by Democrats, the Senate by 
Republicans.

"I don't remember a big fight about this," he said. "There could have been 
one. I just don't remember."

Kerry, who first raised the issue while campaigning in Texas last week, said 
Dean should have objected to the site.

"They should not ship nuclear waste to a Latino community where they don't 
have the clout," Kerry said in a telephone interview Saturday. "Howard Dean 
knew that was the site, and he never stood up and said, "Don't go there." "

David Frederick, a Texas lawyer who represented opponents of the waste-
storage plan, said Vermont and Maine officials entered the agreement knowing 
Texas lawmakers had chosen Sierra Blanca as the site two years earlier.

"It was a case of picking on the weakest among us to receive their trash," 
Frederick said. "Now that's not the whole argument, but if either Vermont or 
Maine felt sufficiently strong about it, they could have weighed in. But they 
did not. They explicitly supported Texas' decision."

Vermont environmentalists lobbied the state geologist and nuclear engineer, 
both of whom supported sending the waste to Sierra Blanca. Vermont Sierra 
Club President Lea Terhune said activists met with Dean's staff but believed 
they would have had to influence a small number of experts to sway Dean.

"I was annoyed at the time and was kind of bothered by the fact that he 
didn't seem to care," Terhune said. "But he was never cozy with 
environmentalists. He's not really cozy with anybody. He wasn't our boy, but 
he wasn't anybody's boy."

The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission rejected the application 
for the permit to build the dump at Sierra Blanca in 1998, citing geological 
instability. The waste ultimately was shipped to South Carolina, according to 
Dean.

Environmental activists say then-Gov. George W. Bush's re-election campaign 
in Texas and possible presidential hopes may have influenced the Bush-
appointed commission to avoid a potentially ethnically charged political land 
mine.

Kerry has tried to link Dean with Bush on the deal, although its signing 
predated Bush's governorship. Dean and Bush were serving as governors at the 
time the issue was before Congress in 1997.

"Nevertheless, Howard Dean and George W. Bush went ahead with their 
agreement," Kerry said. "Paul Wellstone and I fought against it."

Dean, taking a line from the late Minnesota liberal, has said he 
represents "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party."

Kerry's attack is the second in the last month in which one of Dean's rivals 
has tried to associate him with Republicans.

Last month, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri linked Dean to former Republican 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich for Dean's support of cutting Medicare in 1995. 
Dean has said he favored the cuts to save the federal health insurance 
program from insolvency.

"The candidates from Washington are trying to put Governor Dean in a box with 
right-wing Republicans because they stood with President Bush on the war with 
Iraq. They recognize that's a weakness," Dean spokeswoman Sarah Leonard said 
Saturday of Kerry's attack. Dean opposed the war; Kerry and Gephardt voted 
for the resolution in Congress that allowed it.

Recent polls show Gephardt's support in Iowa is second to that of Dean. 
Gephardt, who won the 1988 caucuses, has predicted he will win the 2004 
caucuses.

Kerry is the closest rival behind Dean in New Hampshire, where the Jan. 27 
primary is considered a must win for New Englanders.

State pushes ahead nuclear waste plan 
September 9, 2003
Rutland Daily Herald
By Darren Allen

Montpelier - Vermont officials are planning to pay $12.5 million next month 
toward construction of a radioactive waste dump that might never be built. 
Under legislation passed 10 years ago, Vermont joined with Maine and Texas in 
an agreement under which the two New Enlgand states would pay $27.5 million 
each to send low-level radioactive waste to Texas, which was to find a site 
for disposing of it. Maine dropped out of the compact last year.

The legislation came in response to a federal law that said in essence that 
the federal government would take responsibility for disposing of high-level 
waste - mainly spent nuclear fuel - while the states would take 
responsibility for low-level waste. Low-level waste presents a wide range of 
hazards, depending on the source and type of radiation, according to 
information published on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site.

"The radioactivity can range from just above background levels found in 
nature to very highly radioactive in certain cases, such as parts from inside 
a reactor vessel in a nuclear power plant," the Web site says.

Vermont ships the lowest of its low-level waste to a private firm's disposal 
site in Utah. The more highly radioactive of the low-level waste is shipped 
to Barnwell, SC, to a site that will be closed in 2008. More than 98 percent 
of Vermont's low-level waste comes from the Vermont Yankee nuclear power 
plant in Vernon, with tiny amounts coming from the University of Vermont, 
Middlebury College, and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in White River 
Junction.

Texas first focused on a potential site in the southwestern part of the 
state, about 90 miles from El Paso, but the proposed Sierra Blanca site 
failed to win needed permits. Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers authorized 
another search for a site, and included in the legislation the requirements 
that other compact states - for now, only Vermont - make a $12.5 million 
payment by Nov. 1. Vermont law allows the state in turn to bill its waste 
generators for that amount on a proportional basis. 

Monday, Auditor of Accounts Elizabeth Ready told the Legislature's Joint 
Fiscal Committee, which reviews budgetary matters when the full legislature 
is not in session, that it and other state officials should ask lots of 
questions before sending Texas the $12.5 million.

"If Texas if unable to cause the site to be built, what would happen with the 
$12.5 million?" she asked during testimony to the committee. 

Ready said in a later interview that she is concerned that Vermont Yankee's 
owners, Entergy Nuclear, might balk at making additional payments if the 
first didn't result in a site's being opened. At that point, under federal 
law, the onus would be back on the state to dispose of the waste she said.

William Sherman, nulcear engineer with the state Deparment of Public Service, 
confirmed Ready's understanding of federal law but he expressed confidence 
that Texas would be able to build the facility.

"It's our firm expectation that they will develop a site," Sherman told the 
committee.

Ready noted that none of the other multi-state compacts around the country 
had been able to build a disposal site, and said some had been dissolved. She 
said environmental groups in Texas were raising questions abou the newest 
proposal site in west Texas. 

Robert Williams, spokesperson for Vermont Yankee and Entergy, said his 
company's only interest was that low-level waste not be disposed of in 
Vermont and that it be disposed of in a safe way.

"Compact participation and payments, and things like that - those decisions 
would be made by state governments," Williams said.

New WCS official visits in Andrews
(Thursday, October 09, 2003

Local officials Monday met with the new chief operating officer of Waste 
Control Specialists.

George Dials of Albuquerque, N.M. was named the president and COO of WCS 
replacing Shaun E. McCabe.

Dials, a graduate of MIT with a degree in nuclear engineering, was manager of 
the Carlsbad Area Office of the Department of Energy during the early 
development of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) 30 miles east of 
Carlsbad. 

Dials, and WCS Chairman Kent Hance, met with members of the Andrews 
Industrial Foundation and others concerning the companyâs goal in obtaining a 
permit to treat and dispose of the stateâs low-level radioactive waste.
A bill passed by the Texas Legislature this past session allows for a private 
company to hold the license for the stateâs depository for low-level 
radioactive waste.

The bill also allows the company to handle similar waste from the Department 
of Energy. WCS already operates a hazardous waste facility 30 miles west of 
Andrews on SH 176.

Dials, a West Point graduate who was decorated with the Silver Star during 
the Viet Nam War, has past experience in nuclear-related businesses, 
including being the former president of the Louisiana Energy Services, the 
company which proposes to build a $2 billion uranium-enrichment plant just 
east of Eunice, N.M. near the Texas border on SH 176.

Dials, who had only been on the job for a few days, said he was excited to be 
working for WCS and majority owner Harold Simmons of Dallas.

Hance said Dialsâ experience in the business and with working with the 
Department of Energy and other agencies would be an important asset in WCS 
being licensed by the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality.

Hance said he had wanted the best in the business and felt Dials represented 
that in the field of handling low-level radioactive waste. Hance said Dialsâ 
experience would also greatly aid the business side of operating the plant.

Dials said WCS was a quality waste facility and would continue to be a top-
notch facility when permitted by the state as the low-level radioactive waste 
depository. Dials said he believed in being up-front with people, including 
the public, and would continue to do so regarding WCS and its activities.

Dials said he felt WCS would be successful in being licensed by the state and 
that the additional workload would result in a better company and more jobs 
at the plant. He said the company would continue to be active in the 
community.

Dials plans to live in Dallas where the corporate headquarters is located for 
WCS, but said he plans to be in Andrews and at the site a lot in the coming 
months and years.

NRC on fact-finding mission in area; meet locally
(Sunday, October 05, 2003

Officials with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) visited in Andrews 
Friday about the proposed uranium-enrichment plant in Lea County.

The NRC members were in Andrews after visiting in other communities in New 
Mexico, including Eunice, N.M., Hobbs, N.M. and Tatum, N.M.
The tour was an initial fact-finding mission, the first of probably many 
other visits to New Mexico, which will include public meetings and a hearing 
concerning the project.

The NRC officials said they were in Andrews because of the communityâs 
proximity to the site where the plant would be constructed. 
New Mexico officials last month announced the project during a press 
conference at the site, where state and national legislators touted the plant 
for its potential to bring economic diversification to southeastern New 
Mexico.

Louisiana Energy Services is seeking a license from the NRC for a uranium 
enrichment plant east of Eunice near the Texas-New Mexico border. The site 
was evidently chosen because a similar enrichment project was proposed 
several years ago when preliminary work was completed on the location, 
including site characterization. 

Local, county, state and national representatives also drew LES to the region 
because of their warm reception.

Basically, the plant will produce enriched uranium for nuclear power plants 
through a process, which is already used successfully in the Netherlands.
The NRC is neither a proponent nor opponent of the project, but is the 
licensing agent. LES has submitted plans for the gas centrifuge enrichment 
facility, which would cost about $1.2 billion and take about seven years to 
complete.

During the construction, LES would employ about 600 workers and around 200 
permanent jobs thereafter.

On hand for the meeting were Timothy C. Johnson, Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety, Brian W. Smith, chief special project secretary, and Melanie C. Wong, 
all of Washington, D.C.

Locals attending the meeting included Andrews Industrial Foundation president 
Lloyd Eisenrich, Andrews Mayor Bob Zap, Industrial Foundation member Russell 
Shannon, Andrews City Manager Glen Hackler and Andrews County Judge Richard 
Dolgener.

Also attending were WCS representatives Tom Jones, plant manager, and WCS 
community relations specialist Wesley Barnett.

Johnson said that among the NRCâs main goals would be an evaluation of the 
proposed plant regarding safety for the public and the workers.
The delegation said there would be additional meetings in the future at 
communities likely to the affected by the plant. Wong said ãscopingä sessions 
would determine concerns from the public about safety issues and other 
related concerns.

Information collected during the meetings would be used by the NRC to 
formulate an environmental impact study, critical in the issuance of the 
license for the LES.

A hearing concerning the assessment would likely be held in Eunice or in 
Hobbs, N.M. Input from the public would be taken during these sessions from 
people with ãstanding,ä or those who can show they will be affected by the 
construction of the plant.

Johnson said similar uranium enrichment plants in Europe have operated 
successfully for over 30 years without any major accidents. He said the NRC 
oversees other types of nuclear energy projects.

The uranium ore needed for the project would be transferred to the site by 
truck, although a rail spur has been constructed nearby by Waste Control 
Specialists and could be a possibility.

Johnson said the ore is transported in cylinders, which have stringent safety 
standards, adding that the transportation of nuclear material has an 
excellent record during the last 40 years.

Tentatively, a public meeting will be held in early November in Eunice, N.M. 
concerning the project.

Vermont goes forward with waste disposal payment 
John Dillon 

http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/vpr/news.mediaplayer?
STATION_NAME=vpr&MEDIA_ID=428983&MEDIA_EXTENSION=asf&MODULE=news

 MONTPELIER, VT (2003-10-07) 

(Host) Vermont will pay Texas to develop a nuclear waste dump, even though 
construction for the project hasn't started. The Douglas administration says 
the state is obligated to pay the money under a 1993 contract. But critics 
say the state should renegotiate to strike a better deal.

VPR's John Dillon reports:

(Dillon) A federal law makes the states responsible for low level nuclear 
waste. So ten years ago Vermont and Maine struck a deal to ship the waste - 
primarily contaminated equipment and clothing - to Texas. But Vermont never 
made the first payment of $12.5 million because the first dump site was 
rejected by Texas.

Now Texas has passed a law that allows private developers to build a new 
dump. Texas asked Vermont to pay the $12.5 million by November 1. State 
Auditor of Accounts Elizabeth Ready says it's a bad idea to send the check 
now.

(Ready) "There is no site, no compact and no group of states has been 
successful in locating a site. And until we have a permitted site I really 
don't want to see $12.5 million going from Vermont to Texas. I don't think 
it's a prudent move. I think we would be very well served to renegotiate this 
particular deal in light of these changes."

(Dillon) Ready worries that if the money is spent and the site isn't built, 
the state won't have the funds available to invest in an alternative.

(Ready) "There are some real concerns about this site. First of all, it is 
located on a primary aquifer, the Ogalala Aquifer in Texas. It may well end 
up with the same kind of fate as the last site, which was ultimately rejected 
by a Texas environmental commission. So before we pony up, before we pay this 
money. I think there are some very serious questions that need to be 
answered."

(Dillon) The bill will ultimately be paid by the generators of the waste, 
mainly Entergy Vermont Yankee, the company that owns the state's only nuclear 
power plant. 

Administration Secretary Michael Smith says Entergy has promised that the 
funds won't come from ratepayers. And he says a legal opinion by the attorney 
general's office shows the state has no choice but to make the payment. 

(Smith) "We're going to be talking with Texas. But our legal standing is 
fairly clear about what we're obligated to do. When the compact was first 
negotiated these issues were discussed, and still the fact is that Texas is 
obligated to build the facility. And that's what we are going to assume Texas 
will do."

(Dillon) Smith says the state will make the payment to Texas next month and 
then collect the money from the generators of the low level waste.

Cold War graveyard  
By Jerry Needham  
San Antonio Express-News  
Web Posted : 10/12/2003 12:00 AM  
   
FALLS CITY ÷ Behind a chain-link fence decorated with yellow radiation 
warning signs, a half-mile-long mountain of Texas Hill Country limestone 
rises as a massive monument to the Cold War. 
 Radiation site inspectors Carl Jacobson and Tom Kirkpatrick climb a 60-foot 
mound that covers radioactive dirt and uranium wastes near Falls City. 
Gloria Ferniz/Express-News  

"That's a big ol' mound, a big ol' graveyard," says Fabian Niestroy, 67, 
surveying the pile of rock from the 500 acres his family owns across FM 1334 
from the disposal cell, 8 miles southwest of this town.

The pile is big because it's covering 6 million cubic yards of radioactive 
dirt and uranium processing wastes ÷ most of which was moved there by heavy 
equipment during a site cleanup 10 years ago.

Contractors for the Energy Department, which owns the 232-acre site, then 
buried it under almost a million cubic yards of clean dirt hauled from a mile 
away.

This sparsely populated area, about 45 miles south of San Antonio, had a big 
role in the early nuclear age. The discovery of huge deposits of uranium here 
in the 1950s brought a boom for more than two decades in jobs mining the ore 
and milling it into concentrated material for use in nuclear weapons and 
power plants. 

But the boom turned to bust in the 1980s when the market found cheaper and 
richer ore in Canada and Australia. Left behind were piles of radioactive 
wastes and contaminated aquifers. 

"My dad owned this land since '43 or '44," Niestroy said, baling hay during a 
recent visit. "I saw the mining start up and end out here."

This flat Texas prairie is brush country, and the farmers and ranchers who 
scratch out a living here ÷ many of whom profited from the mines during good 
times ÷ don't seem terribly concerned about the radioactive mess left behind. 
And a recent health study seems to support that attitude.

Many residents seem comfortable enough with the situation to make light of it.

"We can see our cows at night," rancher Niestroy joked over a beer at a local 
bar. "They glow in the dark." 

Niestroy, who moved to San Antonio in 1957 and now raises only cattle and hay 
on his acreage, said his family leased out the land for two mines on the 
property.

"All the mining did concern me at first because of all that stuff they 
removed from all those mines," Niestroy said.

"Let me drink a beer so I don't start glowing," echoes Doyle Culpepper, 52, 
who was born and raised out here where the uranium mines later sprang up. 

For the past 25 years, he's owned the Saddle Tramp and Mule Skinner Inn, a 
beer joint on FM 791 on the mile between the Falls City and Conquista 
disposal cells. The Conquista is another former mill site being cleaned up by 
its owner, Conoco.

"It's a lot better than it was when we had all these open acid pits around 
here," Culpepper said. "I'd say it's 100 percent safe here right now. 
Everything's closed up like when we were kids. It's OK now as long as nobody 
goes bothering it."

The government estimates 1.2 billion gallons of groundwater at the rock-
covered site, formerly owned by Susquehanna-Western Inc., is contaminated 
with materials that include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, alpha 
radiation, nitrate, radium, selenium and uranium.

The Energy Department determined that it would take $350 million to clean up 
the aquifer.

The agency decided not to clean up the dirty water, which has drifted about a 
half-mile from the site in one direction, because the groundwater in that 
area is of limited use due to naturally occurring contamination. 

No one is drinking from the aquifer in the affected area, and only livestock 
drink from any wells that draw from the aquifer within a few miles. 

"Nobody I know drinks the water out here anymore," Culpepper said. "Since the 
late 1970s, we've gotten our water from Three Oaks (Water Supply Corp.)."

Three mills and more than 40 mines were in operation in Karnes County from 
the 1960s to the 1980s. But working with the radioactive material doesn't 
seem to have caused physical harm to its residents, according to one new 
study.

That study, published last month in the Journal of Radiological Protection, 
found fewer-than-expected cancer deaths in the county.

Four researchers from the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, 
Md., studied data from 1950 to 2001 and found cancer death rates in the 
county were similar before, during and after mining and milling of the 
radioactive ore.

They reported they found no difference in cancer death rates in Karnes County 
and those in four similar South Texas counties. They also reported "no 
significant increases in Karnes County for any cancer" when compared with the 
South Texas, Texas or U.S. population.

The Falls City Disposal Site incorporates wastes from Texas' first uranium 
mill, owned and operated by Susquehanna-Western from 1961 through 1973. After 
concentrating the uranium from sandstone ore with a sulfuric acid leaching 
process, it sold the material under contract to the U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission and to nuclear power plants.

Solution Engineering Inc. bought the property, and from 1978 to 1982 further 
extracted uranium from the piles of tailings using acid solutions.

Congress in 1978 passed a law making the Energy Department responsible for 90 
percent of the cleanup and remediation costs at uranium milling sites that 
had provided material to the government but had ceased operating at that time.

The Susquehanna-Western site at Falls City was one of 24 sites nationwide 
that qualified. The surface cleanup began in 1992 and was completed in 1994 
at a cost of $56 million.

Niestroy said he's glad the federal government came in for the cleanup. They 
removed the contaminated dirt from his property. The feds also bulldozed a 
big hill of clean dirt the mining company had removed from atop the uranium 
layer into a huge pit the company had left.

To protect the huge pile from erosion, 140,000 cubic yards of crushed 
limestone ranging in size from 13 inches to 20 inches were hauled 150 miles 
to the site from Marble Falls ÷ by train to Cambellton, and then by truck. 
The rocks cover the sides of the 62-foot-high, 2,000-foot-wide heap to a 
depth of 2 feet.

"Essentially, this repository has to last forever, and it's built to do 
that," Carl Jacobson, program manager for Energy Department contractor S.M. 
Stoller Corp. of Grand Junction, Colo., said during an annual inspection of 
the site.

"Falls City, Texas ÷ Uranium Mill Tailings Repository ÷ No Trespassing ÷ By 
Order of the U.S. Department of Energy," read the signs that also contain the 
universally known three-spoked symbol for radiation.

"The disposal cell at Falls City is designed and constructed to last for 200 
to 1,000 years," notes an Energy Department fact sheet. "However, the general 
license has no expiration date, and DOE understands its responsibility for 
the safety and integrity of the Falls City site will last indefinitely."

"You can't find anything (radioactive readings) above background on any of 
the sites," Jacobson said. "We've got a few sites where houses are moving in 
next door."

Three other South Texas uranium mills still were operating when Congress 
passed the law in 1978 that authorized the Energy Department to clean up 
abandoned mills that had sold uranium under contract to the U.S. government.

They later closed and the owners became responsible for putting the property 
back into a near-natural condition before their transfer to the Energy 
Department for perpetual care. The Texas Department of Health's Bureau of 
Radiation Control has overseen those efforts.

Those sites are:

Conquista, a 600-acre site on FM 971 about 7 miles southwest of Falls City in 
Karnes County and owned by Conoco. The 250-acre disposal cell contains 6.5 
million cubic yards of mill tailings generated during milling operations 
between 1972 and 1982. 

Panna Maria, a 300-acre site on FM 81 between Hobson and Panna Maria in 
Karnes County and owned by Chevron and, now, Rio Grande Resources. The 150-
acre disposal cell contains 7.4 million cubic yards of wastes from the ore 
processing operations that took place there from 1979 to 1992.

Ray Point, a 60-acre site on FM 1358 near Ray Point in Live Oak County. The 
39-acre disposal cell contains 360,000 cubic yards of wastes generated during 
mining and milling operations from 1970 to 1973. Exxon began decommissioning 
the mill in 1979.

Those sites look similar to a large hill or mound with no trees, with a heavy-
duty fence surrounding it all. Groundwater contamination also is a concern at 
those locations.

Falls City, Conquista and Panna Maria are leased to ranchers who bale hay on 
the property. 

All that mining may have brought some bad stuff to the surface, Culpepper 
said, but it also brought some good times for a while.

"There were a lot of people working then," Culpepper said. "It was the first 
job for a lot of us. I was working there when I was 16 years old. I worked in 
a bunch of it ÷ heavy equipment operator and welder."

Expert: Radioactive waste should not come into Utah
Monday, October 20, 2003 - 12:00 AM 
The Associated Press  |  
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SALT LAKE CITY -- A former federal energy department policy adviser says 
radioactive waste from an Ohio Superfund site should not be brought to a 
Tooele County landfill.

"This is not your garden variety of low-level waste," said Robert Alvarez, 
senior policy adviser to three Energy secretaries during the Clinton 
administration.

"This is nasty stuff," said Alvarez, now a senior scholar at the Washington, 
D.C.-based Institute for Policy Studies.

The waste, leftovers from highly concentrated nuclear fuel for bomb making, 
is considered so hazardous that it should be sent instead to an underground 
repository similar to those used for plutonium-tainted waste, he told The 
Salt Lake Tribune.

Normally the waste would be barred from disposal at Envirocare, but a 
paragraph in the energy bill -- which could be debated by the U.S. House of 
Representatives this week -- would redefine the waste so it is allowed in a 
commercial facility.

Envirocare is not mentioned by name, but the one-paragraph provision would 
make it possible for tailings from the Fernald, Ohio, federal cleanup to be 
transported to Utah after Envirocare updates its U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission license.

Envirocare is seeking permission from federal regulators to take radium-226 
that is 25 times more concentrated than allowed by its current license so 
that it can be considered for the $14 million Fernald waste contract, the 
Tribune reported in its Sunday editions.

U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who formerly worked as a statehouse 
lobbyist for Envirocare, has called the Envirocare provision a "win-win" for 
the company and the state, although the Fernald waste is only expected to 
generate about $24,000 in radioactive waste taxes for Utah.

Energy department contractor Fluor Fernald and Envirocare dispute Alvarez's 
assessment of the waste, saying it has long been treated like other low-level 
byproduct material from uranium milling.

"To my thinking," said Envirocare's Ken Alkema, "he doesn't know what he is 
talking about."

Since 1999, Fernald has shipped 97 rail loads of bulk waste to the Tooele 
County landfill, and 38 more are expected in the next few years. Ultimately, 
809,461 tons of Fernald's bulk waste is slated to wind up at the Utah 
landfill.

Efforts for Envirocare to receive the "high-activity" silo waste began last 
year, when the energy department told Congress it would finish the cleanup by 
the end of 2006 rather than the 2010 deadline originally built into its 
contract.

Fluor Fernald signed a contract last March that would give it incentives for 
the accelerated cleanup, the Tribune reported. Under that contract, Fluor 
gets paid $215 million if it completes the job by December 2006. If the work 
is done six months earlier, its paycheck will be $288 million dollars.

Fluor Fernald spokesman Jeff Wagner noted Fernald itself will be the burial 
ground for 90 percent of the cleanup waste, even though the site sits above 
an aquifer that serves millions of people in Ohio.

He said this "balanced approach" also calls for sending the remainder to the 
energy department-owned Nevada Test Site dump and Envirocare.

Under state law, the only revenue the state of Utah would realize from the 
silo waste would be from a radioactive waste tax.

Under that, byproduct waste generated by a government agency is taxed at 10 
cents for every cubic foot of waste. The silo waste is 8,900 cubic yards, or 
240,300 cubic feet.

That means the state treasury can expect to receive about $24,030.

"The tragedy of this is," said Claire Geddes of Utah Legislative Watch, "that 
Utah is being sacrificed in the pursuit of corporate profits and will become 
the nation's bargain-basement dumping ground for this highly toxic 
radioactive weapons waste."

Radioactive waste vessel closes intersection

A north Houston intersection was closed for several hours Thursday when a 
vessel containing radioactive waste fell off a truck, Houston Fire Department 
officials said. 

None of the material leaked, and no injuries were reported from the incident 
at Imperial Valley and Greens just before 1 p.m. 

The public was never endangered, said Houston Fire Department spokesman Jay 
Evans. The intersection was impassable while city and state officials and 
hazardous materials teams investigated.

Evidence of pipe cracks found at nuclear plant 
Oct 28 2003
http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/102803/new_entnuk001.shtml

By The Associated Press
NEW ORLEANS -- Workers at Entergy Corp.'s Waterford 3 nuclear power plant 
have found evidence of cracks in piping that circulates radioactive water 
through the reactor, Entergy has told the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The pipes are located within the 3.5-thick containment structure that encases 
the power plant's reactor, and leaks resulting from any cracks have posed no 
danger to the public, Entergy Nuclear spokeswoman Diane Park said.

Likewise, monitoring equipment within the concrete-and-steel structure has 
not detected any unsafe levels of radiation, she said. The leaks are believed 
to be tiny, Park said Monday.

The cracks were found at Waterford after the plant was shut down Oct. 19 for 
a regularly scheduled maintenance outage, which occurs every 18 months. The 
leaks are located at two spots where pipes connect to the reactor's 
pressurizer and its coolant pump.

Park said the leaks will be repaired during the maintenance outage, but she 
did not know whether the work would prolong the shutdown. Maintenance outages 
typically last three to five weeks, she said.

The cracks are in a nickel-chromium alloy known as Alloy 600, a material that 
is common in pressurized water reactors. Entergy owns and operates five 
pressurized water reactors: Waterford in Taft, Arkansas Nuclear units one and 
two in Russellville, Ark., and Indian Point Energy Center units one and two 
in Buchanan, N.Y.

The industry has been aware of problems with Alloy 600 for more than a 
decade. But the trouble did not become a major concern in the United States 
until last year after cracks were found in pipes at the Oconee plant in South 
Carolina and a hole was found in the reactor lid at the Davis-Besse plant in 
Ohio.

The NRC this year ordered the operators of the nation's 68 pressurized water 
reactor power stations to conduct special inspections of Alloy 600 material 
in their reactors.

The inspections have turned up cracks at the Summer plant near Columbia, 
S.C., and at the South Texas unit one plant near Houston. Waterford is the 
latest U.S. plant to join the list.

Some industry observers consider the alloy problems to be the most 
significant safety issue to face U.S. nuclear plants since the Three Mile 
Island accident in 1979.

"Clearly, there is a level of concern based on what was found at Davis-Besse, 
or the NRC would not have ordered these types of inspections," Park said.

New Orleans Times-Picayune:

Nuclear plant pipes seem cracked 
Boric acid indicates minuscule fracture inside Waterford 3
Tuesday October 28, 2003
By Keith Darc 
Business writer 

Workers at Entergy Corp.'s Waterford 3 nuclear power plant in St. Charles 
Parish have found evidence of cracks in piping that circulates radioactive 
water through the reactor, the New Orleans-based utility reported Monday. 

The pipes are located within the 3.5-foot-thick containment structure that 
encases the power plant's reactor, and leaks resulting from any cracks have 
posed no danger to the public, Entergy Nuclear spokeswoman Diane Park said. 
          
Likewise, monitoring equipment within the concrete-and-steel structure has 
not detected any unsafe levels of radiation, she said. 

The leaks, which are believed to be tiny, were revealed by small amounts of 
boric acid that had collected on pipe nozzles in two different sections of 
the reactor coolant system, Park said. 

Water circulating through the reactor at temperatures ranging from 550 
degrees to 600 degrees contains boron, a chemical that helps control nuclear 
reactions by absorbing neutrons. When the water leaks, it leaves a boric acid 
residue. 

Tiny leaks in a reactor generally do not pose a safety danger, but they can 
become threatening if they become larger. A massive leak could release 
dangerous amounts of radioactive water into the containment building, and it 
could depressurize the reactor and lead to a catastrophic meltdown of the 
reactor core. 

The cracks were found at Waterford after the plant was shut down Oct. 19 for 
a regularly scheduled maintenance outage, which occurs every 18 months. The 
leaks are located at two spots where pipes connect to the reactor's 
pressurizer and its coolant pump. 

Entergy disclosed the discovery Monday in documents filed with the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. 

Parks said the leaks will be repaired during the maintenance outage, but she 
didn't know whether the work would prolong the shutdown. Maintenance outages 
typically last three to five weeks, she said. 

The cracks are in a nickel-chromium alloy known as Alloy 600, a material that 
is common in so-called pressurized water reactors. Entergy owns and operates 
five pressurized water reactors: Waterford in Taft, Arkansas Nuclear units 
one and two in Russellville, Ark., and Indian Point Energy Center units one 
and two in Buchanan, N.Y. 

Alloy 600 is mainly used as lining in pipes as they pass through container 
walls and as weld material on pipes. 

The trouble follows a pattern of problems that have surfaced at several other 
similarly designed nuclear power plants across the country in recent years. 

The industry has been aware of problems with Alloy 600 for more than a 
decade, but the trouble didn't become a major concern in the United States 
until last year after cracks were found in pipes at the Oconee plant in South 
Carolina and a hole was found in the reactor lid at the Davis-Besse plant in 
Ohio. 

The NRC this year ordered the operators of the nation's 68 pressurized water 
reactor power stations to conduct special inspections of Alloy 600 material 
in their reactors. 

The inspections have turned up cracks at the Summer plant near Columbia, 
S.C., and at the South Texas unit one plant near Houston. Waterford is the 
latest U.S. plant to join the list. 

Several nuclear power plant operators, including Entergy, have announced 
plans to replace the lids on some of their older reactors. Entergy said in 
May that it will replace the lid on Arkansas unit one, its oldest nuclear 
plant. The project, which will take two years, could cost the company $85 
million. 

Entergy hasn't decided whether to replace lids on the reactors of Arkansas 
unit two and Waterford 3, Park said. 

Though older nuclear plants are believed to be more susceptible to Alloy 600 
leaks, Waterford, which opened in 1985, is a relatively new plant. 

Some industry observers consider the alloy problems to be the most 
significant safety issue to face U.S. nuclear plants since the Three Mile 
Island accident in 1979. 

"Clearly, there is a level of concern based on what was found at Davis-Besse, 
or the NRC would not have ordered these types of inspections," Park said.

Radioactive waste may go elsewhere
Sunday, November 02, 2003 - 12:00 AM 
N.S. Nokkentved THE DAILY HERALD  |  
Most people would rather not have this kind of stuff buried in their 
community.

But a Utah radioactive waste landfill is prepared to compete for a contract 
to dispose of controversial waste from a federal cleanup site in Ohio.

Envirocare of Utah Inc. says it would have to compete with at least three 
other commercial radioactive waste disposal companies.But two may not be able 
to accept it, and the third hasn't decided whether it is interested.

At issue is the disposal of 1.4 million cubic feet of concentrated uranium 
tailings from a federal cleanup site in Fernald, Ohio. But only if federal 
law covering the waste is changed.

Waste Control Specialists in Texas doesn't have a license to dispose of the 
waste. But if the company were interested, officials could apply to state 
regulators in Texas, which has the authority to regulate uranium tailings, 
company vice president Michael Lauer said.

"It's a business decision," he said. The company already has a suitable site 
for disposal, and the state license application is sitting on a shelf in 
company offices.

"It could happen very quickly," Lauer said.

International Uranium in Blanding can't dispose of the entire amount and is 
not pursuing the disposal contract, said Ron Hochstein from the Vancouver, 
British Columbia-based company's Denver office.

The waste may be too radioactive for the Cotter Corp. in southwest Colorado, 
one state official said. Company officials declined to comment.

And Envirocare would have to get its federal license to dispose of uranium 
tailings changed to accept the waste.

But before the waste can be sent to any commercial radioactive waste 
landfill, federal legislation is needed to give the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission authority to regulate the waste.

"We went to (U.S. Rep. Rob) Bishop and asked him to write a letter," said Tim 
Barney, senior vice president at Envirocare. But it was the federal 
Department of Energy that asked Congress for the legislation.

"This was a DOE-driven initiative," Barney said.

Bishop, R-Utah, a former Envirocare lobbyist, and the federal Energy 
Department requested the legislation that would give the NRC the needed 
authority.

The waste in question now lies inside two crumbling concrete silos at a 
federal Department of Energy site in Fernald, Ohio, which processed uranium 
once used as fuel in nuclear reactors that produce atomic bomb materials.

Once solidified in concrete inside a quarter-inch steel tank, the waste would 
amount to about 1.4 million cubic feet. The element of most concern is the 
radium because it produces radon gas -- considered the second-leading cause 
of lung cancer in the country.

Radium loses its radioactivity slowly. It will take 16,000 years before it 
decays away to insignificant levels. Most of the waste now at Envirocare will 
lose its radioactivity in a few hundred years.

The concentration of radium in the waste is 25 times higher than similar 
waste Envirocare is now licensed to take.

But radium is not the only radioactive element in the waste. It also contains 
thorium, radioactive lead and polonium. A federal document says it contains 
more than 6,100 Curies -- a measure of radioactivity.

The waste includes 31 tons of uranium, 130 tons of barium, 900 tons of lead, 
and almost 3 tons of arsenic. The waste also contains polychlorinated 
biphenyls -- known as PCBs -- but at levels below regulatory concern. 

Cementing the waste would not prevent the release of radon. And the steel 
containers are not expected to last much longer than 150 years.

But disposal at Envirocare assumes the steel canister will corrode and the 
concrete will crumble. The disposal site is designed to contain the material 
to meet Environmental Protection Agency specifications on radon emissions, 
said Envirocare vice president Ken Alkema, who worked three years for the 
cleanup contractor at the Fernald site.

The Energy Department is in the process of cleaning up its facilities at 
Fernald. To complete that process, it needs to find a place for the waste in 
the silos -- too hazardous to be buried at the site.

Unless the federal law is changed, however, the department's only option is 
to send the material to a federal facility in Nevada. That would take longer 
and already has run into local opposition.

One reason for the lapse in regulatory authority may be that the tailings 
were not considered waste until after 1983.

The tailings come from refining uranium ore from the Belgian Congo. The 
Belgian government wanted the radium in the ores for luminescent watch and 
instrument dials, says a case study of the Fernald site by the Institute for 
Energy and Environmental Research based in Takoma Park, Md.

The United States began importing the ore in 1943 for the 40 to 50 percent 
concentration of uranium, much higher than uranium mined in the United 
States, which typically is 2 to 5 percent.

The U.S. government sent recovered radium back to Belgium until 1949, when it 
began sending it to Fernald for storage. Belgium continued to consider the 
radium a resource -- not waste. In 1983, Belgium transferred ownership of the 
material to the Energy Department, the IEER study said.

Though now considered waste, it was never included in any federal waste 
regulatory legislation.

Is a dirty bomb real threat? 
Tuesday, November 11, 2003
By JOHN SOLOMON 
Associated Press Writer 

WASHINGTON -- Federal investigators have documented 1,300 cases of lost, 
stolen or abandoned radioactive material inside the United States over the 
past five years and have concluded there is a significant risk that 
terrorists could cobble enough together for a dirty bomb. 

Studies by the Energy Department's Los Alamos laboratory and the General 
Accounting Office found significant holes in the nation's security net that 
could take years to close, even after improvements by regulators since Sept. 
11, 2001. 

 
"The world of radiological sources developed prior to recent concerns about 
terrorism, and many of the sources are either unsecured or provided, at best, 
with an industrial level of security," the Los Alamos lab concluded two 
months ago in a report that was reviewed by The Associated Press. 

The report concludes that the threat of a so-called dirty bomb that could 
disperse radiological materials across a wide area "appears to be very 
significant, and there is no shortage of radioactive materials that could be 
used." 

Security improvements under way "are unlikely to significantly alter the 
global risk picture for a few years," it added. 

The FBI repeatedly has warned law enforcement over the past year that al-
Qaida was interested in obtaining radiological materials and creating a 
dispersal bomb, most recently after authorities received an uncorroborated 
report a few weeks ago that al-Qaida might be seeking material from a 
Canadian source. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokeswoman Beth Hayden said the agency 
recognizes the potential dangers of such materials and al-Qaida's interest in 
them -- "there are millions of sources," she said. But she added most of the 
1,300 lost radiological sources were subsequently recovered and the public 
should keep the threat in perspective. 

"The ones that have been lost and not recovered, I'm told, if you put them 
all together, it would not add up to one highly radioactive source," Hayden 
said. "These are low-level sources." 

The top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee says the studies 
show security efforts fall short of what is needed. 

"Even though for years we have known of the threat that terrorists would 
use 'dirty bombs' to attack the United States, I am alarmed at the 
government's inadequate response to this very real threat. The economic and 
health costs of such an event would be staggering. It appears we don't even 
know how much material exists that could be used for such weapons or even 
where it is being kept," Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, said. 

The Los Alamos analysis specifically cited concerns about the transportation 
of large shipments of radioactive cobalt from industrial sites, as well as 
lax security at hospitals that use radiological devices to treat and diagnose 
patients. 

The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, detailed how terrorists could 
abuse the legal method for obtaining radiological sources because the NRC 
takes as long as a year to inspect facilities after it mails them a license 
for such materials. 

"Because the process assumes that the applicant is acting in good faith and 
it can take the NRC as along as 12 months before conducting an inspection, it 
is possible that sealed sources can be obtained for malicious intent," the 
GAO told the Senate recently. 

NRC Commissioner Edward McGaffigan Jr. said the GAO concerns were overstated, 
focusing on materials with extremely low level radioactivity. He said his 
agency has been taking steps for months to more securely ship and store high-
risk sources. 

"We honestly think we are doing a very aggressive and excellent job in this 
area, but we have obviously more to do," McGaffigan said in an 
interview. "Our view is we don't want to lose any of them, and we are going 
to have cradle-to-grave controls as soon as we possibly can for high-risk 
sources." 

He said the government was undertaking a first-ever inventory of who 
possesses radioactive materials. 

and how much they possess. 

The GAO questioned whether the NRC has moved fast enough to secure sealed 
sources -- devices that contain small amounts of radiological materials used 
in construction and hospitals. 

"The number of sealed sources in the United States is unknown because NRC and 
states track numbers of licensees instead of sealed sources," the GAO told 
the Senate in a report published in August. 

Two universities told the GAO about security problems with nuclear materials, 
specifically cases in which doors to rooms with the materials had been found 
unlocked or open. 

The congressional investigators found that many of the 114 universities that 
possess, from earlier experiments, the radiological material plutonium-239 
have tried unsuccessfully to return it to the government. The Energy 
Department doesn't have enough secure storage space, the investigators said. 

The congressional investigation for the first time tallied the number of 
times sealed radiological materials have been lost, misplaced or stolen. They 
found more than 1,300 instances inside the United States since 1998. While 
most have been recovered, the report cited a handful of harrowing, unsolved 
losses. 

For instance, in March 1999, an industrial radiography camera containing 
iridium-192 was stolen from a Florida home. The camera has not been recovered 
despite an investigation by the FBI. The NRC believes the material should 
have degraded by now and would no longer be useful for a bomb. 

A North Carolina hospital discovered in March 1998 that 19 sealed sources of 
radiological material, including the highly dispersible cesium-137, were 
missing from a locked safe. They have not been found. 

Security improvements are being made. For instance, the NRC requires tighter 
security by companies that use soil analysis gauges that contain radiological 
materials. There are some 20,000 of them used nationwide by more than 5,100 
licensees. The devices are lost or stolen at a rate of one a week, officials 
said. 

The GAO and Los Alamos security reviews made several recommendations. They 
include keeping licensed sources from getting radiological materials until 
after they are inspected, improving structural security at high-risk 
locations and working with federal, state and international regulators to 
toughen controls. 

"These efforts are unlikely to significantly alter the global risk picture 
for a few years, although the risks regarding certain sources and 
circumstances could change more quickly," the Los Alamos study conceded.

Panel opens door to hotter radioactive waste in Utah

Patty Henetz
Associated Press
Nov. 11, 2003 12:05 PM

SALT LAKE CITY - A congressional panel has reclassified uranium mill tailings 
in Fernald, Ohio, the first necessary step for Utah hazardous waste companies 
that want to import and store 30 million pounds of highly concentrated 
radioactive waste.

House and Senate negotiators, working to resolve differences in their 
versions of the 2004 energy and water appropriations bill, agreed to allow 
the waste at the Fernald site and another radioactive storage site to be 
defined as "byproduct material," which officials at the Utah companies 
Envirocare and the White Mesa Mill facility of International Uranium Corp. 
likely will bid on.

The conference committee's action came as a surprise both to Envirocare and 
critics of reclassification, including Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, who said he 
had been focusing on the same issue in a different energy bill.

The conference committee's report on the $27.33 billion appropriations bill, 
however, will go to the House and Senate as early as next week for final 
passage. Conference committee reports can only be adopted or rejected, not 
changed.

Matheson noted that the House version of the energy and water bill didn't 
have the reclassification language, and he was unaware that it had been 
inserted in the Senate bill. Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said it was inserted 
by another senator at the request of the Bush administration.

Ohio Sen. George Voinovich earlier had proposed adding identical language to 
a Senate energy bill.

Before the reclassification, the waste would be barred from disposal at 
Envirocare, Instead, it would have been shipped to the Nevada Test Site.

Dane Finerfrock, director of the Utah Division of Radiation Control, said the 
congressional committee's action Friday was only a first step. If Envirocare 
were to win the bid to import the waste, it would also have to petition to 
amend its license and to modify its groundwater permit.

Envirocare spokeswoman Betty Arial said Envirocare expects to compete for the 
Fernald waste contract with a federal facility and at least three other 
contractors: Lakewood, Colo.-based Cotter Corp.; Waste Control Specialists of 
Andrews, Texas; and International Uranium Corp. through its White Mesa mill 
in Blanding, Utah.

If all goes well for Envirocare, the "absolute earliest" the company could 
take the Fernald waste would be next October, Arial said.

Lab, GAO report terror risk of waste 
By John Solomon
The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - Federal investigators have documented 1,300 cases of lost, 
stolen or abandoned radioactive material inside the United States during the 
past five years and have concluded there is a significant risk terrorists 
could cobble enough together for a dirty bomb.

Studies by the Energy Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory and the 
General Accounting Office found significant holes in the nation's security 
net that could take years to close, even after improvements by regulators

Hutchison endorses plutonium pitch 
By GREG ROHLOFF
grohloff@amarillonet.com  

In making another pitch for the location of a new plutonium pit facility at 
Pantex, a contingent of Amarillo representatives gained the endorsement of 
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
Kevin Schweers, a spokesman for the Texas Republican, said Hutchison agreed 
to write an endorsement letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham advocating 
Pantex as the site for the plant that would make new triggers for nuclear 
weapons.

The DOE wants to name a location for the plant by April and is considering 
Savannah River Site near Aiken, S.C.; Pantex; Nevada Test Site; and sites at 
Los Alamos and Carlsbad in New Mexico.

Schweers said a report to Congress from the Department of Energy is expected 
by Nov. 30.

Mayor Trent Sisemore - accompanied by City Manager John Ward, City 
Commissioner Robert Keys, Amarillo Chamber of Commerce President Gary 
Molberg, John Teague, vice president of governmental affairs for the chamber, 
and Amarillo Globe-News Publisher Les Simpson - said the buzz during the 
visit Thursday and Friday was that the report may include a delay in naming a 
preferred location.

"Whatever decisions are made, it's going to generate some controversy."
U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry

 
The group met with Linton Brooks, National Nuclear Safety Administration 
administrator; Pete Olson, chief of staff for U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas; 
Hutchison's staff; U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon; Dr. Dale Klein of 
the Department of Defense; John Conway, chairman of the Defense Nuclear 
Facilities Safety Board; and Madelyn Creedon of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee staff.

None tipped their hand on preferences for the site, Sisemore said.

"It's the best-kept secret in Washington right now," Sisemore said.

The group reiterated widespread support for the facility in Amarillo, the 
work ethic and record of the Pantex work force, and its expertise in 
manufacturing and the transportation challenges of moving pits from Pantex 
where they are now stored to another location for remanufacturing, Sisemore 
said.

Molberg said Washington officials appreciated the effort made in the trip and 
were complimentary toward BWXT Pantex, the Pantex plant contractor.

Thornberry said he had not heard any indication of which location may win 
out, noting the Savannah River Site is considered a front-runner because it 
will dispose of excess plutonium.

"Whatever decisions are made, it's going to generate some controversy," 
Thornberry said, noting the opposition in some quarters to the building of 
new nuclear weapons.

EPA Plan Would Ease Rules on Nuke Waste 
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
Associated Press Writer 

WASHINGTON (AP)--The Bush administration is considering allowing low-level 
radioactive waste to be dumped at toxic waste sites and other facilities that 
currently aren't permitted to receive it. 

The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to issue a notice Tuesday 
seeking public comments on the proposal. 

The notice, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, asks the 
public to weigh in on whether certain levels of radioactive waste can be 
stored in landfills or hazardous material disposal sites. 

Nuclear power companies can dispose of low-level radioactive waste at a 
handful of sites around the country, and about 20 sites can dispose of 
hazardous material. 

The EPA notice says a rule change could simplify the process for getting rid 
of hazardous and radioactive waste for nuclear power companies and others 
that generate it. 

"The need to comply with two separate regulatory systems, each of which is 
targeted to a different component of the waste, creates a certain regulatory 
and economic burden on mixed waste generators," the EPA states in its 
notice. 

Companies have stored a lot of waste instead of disposing of it because of 
the burden of getting rid of it properly, the notice says. 

Environmentalists criticized the new proposal. 

"They can save a lot of money if their waste doesn't have to go to a 
facility designed to safely contain it," said Daniel Hirsch, president of 
the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los Angeles-based nuclear watchdog group. 

Environmentalists urged new EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt, the former 
governor of Utah, not to make the changes. 

"EPA's proposal, within days of Gov. Leavitt's confirmation as the new EPA 
chief, to deregulate radioactive wastes, is a deeply troubling assault on the 
environment," said Diane D'Arrigo, nuclear waste project director for the 
Washington-based Nuclear Information and Resource Service. 

EPA spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman said the agency will consider public comments 
before taking further action. 

The notice focuses on commercial nuclear waste but asks for input on whether 
the Energy Department should also loosen its rules governing the disposal of 
radioactive waste from weapons plants.

DeLay fund-raiser on eve of trial raises eyebrows 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau 

AUSTIN -- On the eve of the federal trial that could enhance Republican 
congressional power, U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay plans to scoop up 
re-election cash at an Austin lobby fund-raiser. 

The Dec. 10 luncheon is scheduled the day before a three-judge panel begins a 
trial on the legality of a congressional redistricting map that DeLay, R-
Sugar Land, pushed through the Texas Legislature earlier this year. 

A dozen Austin lobbyists are hosting the event. Their clients include Verizon 
Wireless, Accenture management consultants, Waste Control Specialists, the 
Texas Medical Association and the Texas Association of Realtors. 

Wayne Franke, one of the organizers, said it is pure coincidence that the 
fund-raiser is set for the day before the redistricting trial. And an aide 
for DeLay said the event's date was set before the trial was scheduled. 

"We were going to have it a lot earlier, but the congressional agenda did not 
cooperate," Franke said. 

Franke said Austin lobbyists have hosted a $1,000-per-person luncheon for 
DeLay each of the past six or seven years. He said the most people who 
attended was 30, and he believes there were 18 at last year's event. 

"Some have business up in Washington, and they go up there quite a bit. And 
those are the ones who usually participate here," Franke said. "They handle 
state issues and they handle federal issues. That would be the reason." 

Franke said some knew DeLay when he was a member of the Texas House. DeLay 
was elected to the U.S. House in 1984. 

Suzy Woodford, executive director of Common Cause of Texas, said she believes 
DeLay's appearance in Austin is meant to pressure the federal judges hearing 
the redistricting case. 

"He's not known as `The Hammer' for no reason," Woodford said, referring to 
DeLay's nickname in Washington. "If you have an issue pending that you really 
care about, this is a good way of letting them (the judges) know he's 
watching." 

But DeLay political aide Jim Ellis said there is nothing sinister about the 
timing. 

"You'll have to ask the court if they meant anything by scheduling the 
hearing right after the DeLay fund-raiser because it's been on the books for 
a long time -- long before they chose that date for the court case," Ellis 
said. 

At DeLay's urging, the Legislature passed a congressional redistricting plan 
last month designed to erase the 17-15 majority that Democrats hold in the 
state's congressional delegation and likely replace it with a 22-10 
Republican majority. 

DeLay argued a new map was needed because the current map denied the 
Republicans a majority when they have won every statewide office and a 
legislative majority. 

Democrats and minority groups have gone into federal court to try to block 
the plan, claiming it harms minority voting rights to achieve a GOP majority. 

The court has set a hearing on motions for summary judgment for Dec. 8, with 
the trial to begin Dec. 11 if the court does not grant any of those motions. 

The DeLay fund-raiser will be held at the InterContinental Stephen F Austin 
Hotel. The host committee consists of lobbyists Franke, Tony Bennett, Tom 
Clarke, Bill Clayton, Jenny Fowler, Alfred Gilchrist, Ron Hinkle, Bill 
Messer, Bill Pewitt, N.J. "Buzz" Robnett, Bill Stevens and Bill Stinson. 

Messer and Robnett served in the Texas House with DeLay. Clayton was House 
speaker at that time.

Dumping on the Dump
Environmentalists and others think legislative haste led to bad nuclear waste 
law.

By Betty Brink
 
Burnam: 'This is what you get when legislators don't do their homework.'  

On Earth Day, ironically enough, the 78th Texas Legislature finally passed 
what State Rep. Lon Burnam calls "a monopoly corporate welfare bill" -- 
intended to enrich one specific corporation. He's talking about the bill 
allowing development of a multi-state nuclear dump in Texas, and he says it 
was written for the benefit of Waste Control Specialists, a West Texas 
hazardous waste dump owned by Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons. "It will 
allow Texas to become a nuclear waste dumping ground for the nation -- if not 
the world," he said. 
It was a long time coming. Versions of the so-called "low-level" radioactive 
waste disposal measure have been proposed repeatedly for nearly a decade, 
defeated each time by intense lobbying from environmental groups and anti-
nuclear activists. This year they lost. The bill passed both chambers with 
little notice, Burnam said, as most of the media coverage centered on the 
redistricting dance between the two parties. 

This is a "risky experiment," Burnam said. The facility will be "host to 
commercial, federal, and mixed hazardous wastes all at the same site, a 
deadly combination of products that are not compatible." 

Opponents, however, have not given up the battle completely. They will fight 
a rearguard action in Austin on Dec. 17, trying to convince the state 
environmental agency to minimize the bill's damage via licensing and 
operating rules. And they are hoping for help from an unusual quarter -- the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is nearly always on the opposite side of 
issues from the anti-nuke lobby, but this time may be the groups' best ally. 
The NRC has tossed in a monkey wrench that could shut the dump down 
altogether -- or make it unprofitable for a private company to operate. 

The law as written, the NRC says, is in direct conflict with federal 
statutes. Bottom line, according to NRC spokesperson Dave McIntyre, is that 
unless the law is changed, the NRC will not allow any shipments of federally 
owned radioactive waste to any Texas site. That alone could doom the dreams 
of Simmons. 

But other concerns raised by the law are myriad. Susybelle Gosslee, president 
of the Dallas League of Women Voters, is most worried about the dangers of 
moving radioactive cargoes through the state to reach the dump. She wants the 
regs to require extra funding for "comprehensive first-response teams for 
communities throughout the state ... and adequate security" in transport. 
Burnam, the voters league, and others are also worried that, if the dump is 
located as expected on Simmons' company's land in West Texas, the radioactive 
and other hazardous wastes to be buried there in unlined trenches will 
eventually permeate the underlying red clay and contaminate the aquifer 
below. 

Other dumps located on similar clays have turned into nuclear nightmares, 
Burnam said, with taxpayers ending up footing the bill. Burnam wants the 
regulations tightened to "zero leak tolerance." 

In fact, the new law raises so many concerns and potential conflicts that one 
environmental attorney has suggested that the state agency, the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality, will be opening the state up to years of 
litigation if it tries to implement the law in its present form. 

"If there was ever a time for an agency charged with such a monumental task 
to go above and beyond the minimal requirements of the law," Burnam 
said, "the time is now." 

The three-member environmental commission will take testimony on Dec. 17, 
before approving the policies that will govern the planned dump for about the 
next 15 years. Staffer Susan Jablonski said the TCEQ encourages public 
testimony, and that concerns raised at earlier hearings have already 
convinced staff to make some changes to the proposed regulations. She would 
not say what they are. 

The changes that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is seeking are no small 
matter. In a letter to the state agency, NRC official Paul Lohaus pointed out 
that the Texas law conflicts with federal law regarding ownership of the 
land, buildings, and ultimately the waste. 

Federal regulations governing low-level nuclear waste disposal sites are 
stringent about ownership -- and there are no exceptions, said the NRC's 
McIntyre. They require that the land and the buildings be owned by either the 
state or federal government before a license to operate is issued, he said. 
Otherwise, the NRC will not approve any transfer of federal waste to the 
site. 

Under the Texas law, the private owner would not be required to turn over the 
federal waste site to the feds until decommissioning, years into the 
future. "That's not acceptable," McIntyre said. "This ownership issue has to 
be resolved," he said, before any wastes from a federal facility can be 
shipped. 

Government ownership "from the beginning and into perpetuity," is critical, 
McIntyre said, to guarantee that the contaminated site will be maintained and 
monitored for the safety and health of the public long after the license 
holder is gone. "There must be certainty of the stewardship" of a nuclear 
waste site beyond the 15 or 30 years of a license holder, he said. "The Texas 
regs have to be compatible with the NRC's. Right now they are not." 

The issue is one of keen interest to billionaire Simmons. His company already 
owns a hazardous waste disposal facility on about 1,000 acres in Andrews 
County not far from the New Mexico border. He has reportedly spent about $1 
million in the past two years lobbying and contributing to legislator's 
campaigns, in an effort to get the bill passed. One portion of the resulting 
law will, for the first time, allow a nuclear dump to be privately owned and 
operated. The law also will allow the eventual licensee to accept tens of 
millions of cubic feet of radioactive waste, not only from nuclear power 
plants and medical facilities, but from nuclear weapons programs dating to 
1943. Today those federal wastes are "temporarily" stored by the Department 
of Energy at aging and leaking facilities around the country. 

There's little doubt in Austin that Simmons' company will win the 
license. "His lobbyists, 16 of them, helped write the bill," Colin Leyden, an 
aide to Burnam, said. 

Burnam represents the Texas Radioactive Waste Defense Fund, a coalition of 
statewide groups that includes the Sierra Club, Public Citizen, and the 
League of Women Voters. He said the regulations as currently proposed allow a 
tolerance for leaks, which is unacceptable. 

"This dump will be built with an assumption that leaks will occur," he said, 
and that the red clay underneath Andrews County will keep radiation, 
including long-lived isotopes such as plutonium, from migrating into the 
water tables. 

Similar assumptions about the imperviousness of clay doomed a low-level waste 
dump at Maxey Flats in Kentucky, he pointed out in testimony before the TCEQ. 
It was closed in the 1980s after radioactive isotopes migrated to the 
groundwater. The operator walked away, and Maxey Flats is now a Superfund 
clean-up site. Burnam listed five other low-level waste sites around the 
country that had been touted as safe that turned into nuclear hot-spots. 

The years-long effort to open a waste site in the state was driven by Texas' 
commitment to Vermont and Maine under a compact approved in 1988, with 
Congressional approval. In that agreement, Texas committed to building a dump 
for nuclear waste generated within its borders and allowing the two smaller 
states to ship their wastes here for a $25 million fee. (The only exception 
is spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Those hot rods must be shipped to a 
federal high-level waste site that may or may not open someday at Yucca 
Mountain in Nevada.) The compact was supposed to shield Texas from having to 
accept nuclear waste from other states under interstate commerce regulations. 
However, Maine's legislature voted last year to pull out of the compact 
because of the years of delay. Its only reactor has been decommissioned and 
sent to other disposal sites. 

That leaves the radioactive detritus from Texas' two nuclear plants and 
Vermont's one plant, as well as a small amount of medical and research 
wastes. Not enough, Simmons reportedly has said, to make a dump profitable. 
He has lusted after the DOE wastes from the git-go, Burnam said. "That's 
where the money is." The Texas Observer recently estimated that profits from 
such a dump could top $100 billion. 

But that potential for profit could also become a nightmare for the state, 
according to Austin environmental attorney David Fredrick, an opponent of the 
dump. Because there are such "large profits to be made in radioactive waste 
disposal," he warned the commission, "there are a number of corporations, 
individuals, institutions, and even states that would have incentives to 
challenge the entire Texas ... program," if the commission is forced to adopt 
rules that conflict with federal law. That could throw the state into 
litigation that could last for decades, he said. 

"This bill was on the fast track this session," Burnam said. "No one bothered 
to check with the feds. This is what you get when legislators don't do their 
homework."

Rep. West to seek another House term
By Julie Breaux
Odessa American
Friday November 21, 2003 

State Rep. Buddy West will seek his fourth term in the state House of 
Representatives next year.

The 67-year-old Republican from Odessa announced his plans during his town 
hall meeting Thursday at the Odessa Chamber of Commerce.

ãI will run for re-election because of all the issues on the board now,ä West 
told the gathering of about 50 constituents and business and civic leaders.
West said he feels heâs in a ãposition to move forwardä on issues significant 
to District 81, which includes a majority of Ector, Andrews and Winkler 
counties.

One of those issues is the licensing of a disposal site for low-level 
radioactive waste.

Currently, Waste Control Specialists Inc. has a license to store low-level 
radioactive waste at its 1,600-acre facility in Andrews County. But the 
company doesnât have a license for its disposal.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has just begun whatâs expected 
to be a lengthy process of approving an application for a license to dispose 
of radioactive waste in Texas.

West said with the geology and hydrology of Andrews County, Andrews ãstands 
wellä to be that disposal site.

ãIt will be the economic driver of West Texas,ä he said, referring to the 
jobs a low-level radioactive waste disposal site would generate directly and 
indirectly.

West wrote the bill allowing for the disposal of radioactive waste in Texas 
during the recently adjourned Legislature.

Elected to his House seat in 1993, West is chairman of the House Energy 
Resources Committee and a member of the Environmental Regulations Committee 
and the Committee on Administration.

He also serves as vice-chairman for the Texas Railroad Commissionâs Oil Field 
Cleanup Fund Advisory Committee.

West lives in Odessa with his wife, Shirley. The Wests have one son and two 
daughters.

Rep. West visits Andrews, announces re-election bid
(Sunday, November 23, 2003

State Rep. Buddy West Thursday took time out during a quick stopover at the 
Andrews County Courthouse to announce his intentions in seeking re-election 
for another term in Austin.
Rep. West, touring Odessa, Andrews and Kermit during town hall meeting, said 
he wanted to return to Austin for another term and finish projects that have 
been started, including finding a new funding source for public education.
West, a Republican, represents District 81 in the Texas Legislature and told 
a small gathering of constituents at the courthouse that he felt compelled to 
seek re-election because of so many projects underway now in Austin.

West was elected to his seat in 1993 and is chairman of the House Energy 
Resources Committee and is a member of the Environmental Regulations 
Committee and the Committee on Administration. He also served as vice-
chairman for the Texas Railroad Commissionâs Oilfield Cleanup Fund Advisory 
Committee. 

Several of the issues include finding a new funding source for public 
education, which has gained support since more and more districts are finding 
themselves on the short end of Robin Hood or recapture, which sends money 
from property-rich school districts to poor ones.

West said as it current stands now, he didnât think Gov. Rick Perry would 
call another special session for funding education until he knew some type of 
funding mechanisms were in place. ãCurrently, there just isnât anything on 
the plate,ä he said about possible solutions.

West said a select committee consisting of Senate and House members is 
attempting to reach a consensus on funding methods, but West said thus far it 
didnât appear that the committee had been productive.

ãI doubt the governorâs going to call everyone back for a special session 
unless thereâs a pretty good chance thereâs a solution at hand,ä West said.

Because most of the school districts in Texas are at or near the maximum 
$1.50 tax rate, lawmakers have finally discussed shifting the financial 
burden from property taxes to businesses or by increasing the sales taxes. 
West said a state income tax would probably be fairer to all concerned, but 
itâs probably not going to happen.

Another issue on tap will be the permitting for the stateâs low-level 
radioactive waste disposal, which most likely will involve Waste Control 
Specialists in Andrews County.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is in the process of writing 
and approving an application for a license to dispose of the waste in Texas.
West said all the geology and water issues bode well for WCS in Andrews 
County. West helped write the bill allowing for a private company to be 
licensed for the project.

Local assistant school superintendent David Mitchell asked West to remember 
school children during the next session, Mitchell saying that the 
legislatorsâ efforts on cutting costs had hurt some disadvantaged school kids.
Mitchell was referring to two low-income dental programs geared toward 
certain economically disadvantaged children, who had been hurt by the cuts.

West said he understood Mitchellâs concerns, but said the 78th Legislatureâs 
main task had been finding funds to run the state for another two years. 
West, however, said he saw the need for taking care of students. ãItâs 
probably an issue of Îpay me now, versus pay me later,âä in regards to 
healthy students.

 Bush clears way for mini-nukes
President signs defense bill allocating funds toward major change in weapons 
designs

By STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

WASHINGTON -- President Bush signed a $401.3 billion defense authorization 
bill Monday, saying members of the U.S. armed forces are facing "a great and 
historic task" in confronting terrorism. 

"The stakes for our country could not be higher," the president said at a 
Pentagon ceremony. "We face enemies that measure their progress by the chaos 
they inflict, the fear they spread and the innocent lives they destroy." 

"America's military is standing between our country and grave danger," he 
proclaimed. 

Though the president focused his comments on the conventional military, the 
defense bill is a first step toward dramatic change in U.S. nuclear weapons 
research. U.S. weapons scientists at Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and 
Sandia labs now are encouraged to explore new H-bombs, including low-
yield "mini-nukes," for the first time in nearly a decade.  

Unlike during the Cold War, when nuclear weapons were designed for specific 
threats, the Pentagon's civilian leaders have called for a new "capability-
based" arsenal for uncertain conflicts. 

Bush spoke before leaving for a holiday week at his ranch. On the way to 
Texas, Bush stopped at Fort Carson, Colo., which has lost 28 soldiers in Iraq 
since the president declared an end to major combat on May 1. Four were among 
16 soldiers killed Nov. 2 when a helicopter was shot down in the dangerous 
Sunni Triangle near Fallujah. Fort Carson has sent 12,000 troops to Iraq, its 
largest deployment since World War II. 

The president lunched with soldiers, met privately with families of some who 
have died and spoke about the situation in Iraq, where on Sunday two U.S. 
troops were killed and then pummeled with concrete blocks and a soldier trav 
eling in a convoy was killed by a road-

side bomb. 

Bush said the war in Iraq is making America safer "from terrorists who hate 
what we stand for." He spoke before hundreds of cheering soldiers and family 
members in an aircraft hangar. The soldiers and their families are 
sacrificing for "democracy, tolerance and the rights and dignity of every 
people," Bush said, adding, "The United States of America will not be 
intimidated by a bunch of thugs." 

U.S. policies in Iraq are a major political vulnerability for Bush in the 
2004 election season. 

After months in which more than half of Americans approved of the president's 
handling of Iraq, a recent CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed disapproval at 54 
percent and approval at 45 percent. Other polls find the public evenly 
divided on that question. 

Public approval of Bush's handling of the economy, meanwhile, has increased 
recently with positive news on that front. 

Among other things, the defense bill: 

Raises salaries for soldiers by an average of 4.15 percent, and extends 
increases in combat and family separation pay. 

Calls for the Air Force to lease 20 Boeing 767 planes as in-flight refueling 
tankers and to buy 80 more. 

Partially overturns rules preventing disabled veterans from receiving some 
retirement pay as well as disability compensation. 

Grants Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld increased control over 700,000 
civilian employees. Pentagon officials said restrictions on hiring, firing 
and promoting employees forced them to use military personnel for jobs better 
suited for civilians. Democrats said the bill goes too far in stripping 
overtime guarantees and job protection rules. 

Exempts the military to provisions of the Endangered Species Act and the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Pentagon claimed environmental laws 
restrict training exercises; environmentalists said the laws have had little 
effect on training and that the exemptions go too far. 

Lifts a decade-old ban on research into low-yield nuclear weapons and 
authorizes $15 million for continued research into a powerful nuclear weapon 
for threatening deep underground bunkers. 

Weapons scientists are studying making two high-yield nuclear bombs -- the 
B63 designed by Livermore and the B61 designed by Los Alamos -- into tougher, 
more rigid and harder designs so they can survive a plunge through a few 
dozen feet of rock or concrete and detonate. The resulting bomb, known as the 
Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, is intended to be used on deeply buried 
bunkers and mountain tunnels, where the Bush administration argues that 
military leaders might feel safe to launch a biological or nuclear strike on 
the United States or its allies. 

In a separate spending bill, however, Republican lawmakers joined Democrats 
in cutting in half the funds for the nuclear penetrator. Congress also made 
sizeable cuts in White House requests for building a new plutonium bomb 
factory and reducing delays for a resumption of nuclear testing, if the 
president requests it. 

"Fortunately, they did not get everything they wanted," said Jon Wolfsthal, 
deputy director of the nonproliferation project for the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace. "In a world where they're breaking open every piggy 
bank and can't print money fast enough, they're still hesitant to fund this 
initiative fully."

Headline: Rebuilding nuclear arsenal -- Detail Story
 
      
S. Iqtidar Husain 

The policies of the United States in the nuclear field have recently 
undergone a major shift, and this has serious implications internationally. 
At the end of the cold war both the United States and the former Soviet Union 
decided to scale down their nuclear arsenal reducing the number of warheads 
by sixty per cent by the year 2012. 

This was in terms of the Moscow Treaty, ratified by the US Senate in March 
2003. Production of all other nuclear components and materials was also 
halted. An embargo was placed on all nuclear weapons-testing in the US in 
1992 and the site for such testing at Nevada closed down. All this is now 
changing. 

The first indicator came during the Clinton administration, when the Senate 
refused to ratify in 1998 the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), of which 
the US itself was the sponsor. Before the decision in the US Congress, an 
intense debate took place in the American print and electronic media on the 
merits of the CTBT. 

For full four days one watched on various TV channels in the US analyses and 
commentaries by experts on the different clauses of this treaty and its 
implications. all the serious newspapers, the New York Times, Wall Street 
Journal etc. were full of editorials and op-eds on the subject. 

Interestingly what was quite revealing was that in all these writings and 
discussions, barring one college student, a girl of Indian origin, who 
objected to nuclear weapons per se being inherently immoral and devastating, 
no one raised this issue as particularly relevant. Instead, the entire focus 
was on how America would be disadvantaged by acceding to this treaty, in not 
being able to modernize its nuclear arsenal and carry out further research in 
this field; this despite the US possessing the largest and most comprehensive 
stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. Predictably, the treaty was not 
ratified. 

The Bush administration plunged head-long into the nuclear revival programme, 
with its emphasis on a more assertive nuclear strategy. The first signs of 
the administration's new nuclear policy came last January in its Nuclear 
Posture Review. 

The Policy Paper, produced by the Pentagon, said that the United States 
should not just maintain the capability to launch large nuclear counter-
strikes as a deterrent to nuclear powers, "but should consider possibly 
striking pre-emptively at those countries developing nuclear, chemical or 
biological weapons." 

The doctrine proposed the manufacture of a new generation of nuclear weapons 
called "bunker-busters" to destroy caches of weapons buried deep underground. 
The doctrine also stipulated the creation of low-yield (5 kilo tons) nuclear 
warheads which had been banned in the US under a decade old law. It was also 
recommended that the ban on nuclear weapons testing be lifted. 

The bad news is that the above doctrine is being implemented quite rapidly. 
After much deliberation by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and despite 
some reservations from the Democrats, the Committee cleared proposals in the 
defence budget 2004 to revive America's nuclear arms industry. These 
proposals have been approved by the lower house of the Congress this month 
(November) and would soon be cleared by the Senate. 

The defence spending bill for 2004 provides six million dollars to explore 
new nuclear bomb designs and fifteen million dollars to study modifying 
existing high-powered nuclear weapons so that they can destroy buried 
bunkers. These bombs would be called the "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrators" 
and would be a modification of existing hydrogen bombs. This proposed device 
would be able to burrow deep into the earth, and to create shock waves 300 
meters below the surface which would be six times more powerful than the 
Hiroshima bomb, experts say. 

The figures given above are just a minor indicator of the overall nuclear re-
vamping programme that is proposed and which runs into billions of dollars. 
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, proposals in President Bush's 
budget would refurbish virtually every facet of the nuclear weapon complex, 
re-building the country's nuclear weapons industry, and resume the production 
of nuclear components and materials, halted after the end of the cold war. 

According to the same paper, the proposals include $ 320 million to build new 
plutonium cores-known as "pits", for nuclear war heads, $ 40 million of which 
would be used to design a plant capable of producing 500 such "pits" a year. 
An additional $ 135 million would go to restart production of tritium, which 
has not been produced by the government for more than a decade. Tritium is a 
gas which dramatically increases the force of thermo nuclear explosions. 

In the words of Robert Civiak, a scientist and analyst on nuclear weapons 
spending, the fastest growing programme in the budget of National Nuclear 
Security Administration, which oversees all nuclear weapons, is refurbishment 
of all the industrial machinery of nuclear warhead production. "People don't 
realize that we are getting back into the nuclear bomb business in a big way, 
and it is a very expensive business" said Joseph Cirinicione, director of the 
non-proliferation project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 

The figures for America's stockpile of nuclear materials are mind-boggling, 
though these are classified. Some statistics are available in the US media. 
The Energy Department, in 1999, indicated that there were 12,000 plutonium 
pits in storage in Amarillo, Texas., in addition there are nearly 200 tons of 
highly enriched uranium at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, according 
to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientist US officials maintain "we want a nuclear 
arsenal that would last forever." 

Compare the above to the alleged production by Iran and North Korea! The 
charge is that nuclear weapons in the hands of "rogue" states are dangerous, 
but there were many hot-heads in America, including in the administration, 
during the Afghan and Iraq wars who openly advocated the use of nuclear bombs 
in these theatres. 

Disarmament experts state "we are moving away from five decades of efforts to 
delegitimize the use of nuclear weapons." The question is, "does the United 
States need the additional nuclear weapons", especially given its growing 
conventional capabilities in precision guided munitions? 

Remember four different aircraft simultaneously dropping 10,000 lb bombs each 
with precision hitting time on target, while aiming for Saddam Hussain's 
hideout in Baghdad. This was an improvement on the daisy cutter used in the 
caves of Tora Bora. 

The impact of these four bombs together was greater than any conventional 
strike in the past. The irony is they still didn't hit Saddam Husain. And now 
the latest is MOAB (Mother of All Bombs), a 10,000 kg monster that would 
smother the target area with a flammable mist creating a powerful blast. 

There is widespread anxiety about the latest turn in American nuclear plans. 
To quote one American activist from Berkley California "I don't know how 
President Bush and his administration imagine the future, but it can't be one 
dedicated to securing a peaceful co-existence in a prosperous international 
community, intent on maintaining a healthy well educated population. That 
future requires thoughtful approaches to allies and foes alike, to economies 
not solely governed by profits at the expense of subordinate population, to 
environments that support flourishing ecosystem, clean air water and land. 

The Bush administration supports renewed nuclear studies and weapons testing 
and is in favour of a repeal on the ban on smaller more usable nuclear 
warheads. This support and the policy of military pre-emption is an extremely 
dangerous position to foster and perils all life. These are policies which 
must be challenged and defeated, if we, the general citizens of the world, 
are not to be held hostage to the narrower and most restrictive ideas of how 
the world is to be shaped and governed. 

The redesigning of nuclear weapons especially the production of low yield 
ones is going to definitively change the character of nuclear warfare. It 
implies a movement from pure deterrence, the philosophy of MAD (Mutually 
Assured Destruction), to one of actual use - from the strategic to the 
tactical. 

There could be great temptation to actual use of bombs like the bunker-
busters in certain situations, especially where there may not be any 
possibility of nuclear retaliation. The obvious targets for the low - yield 
nuclear weapons and the bunker busters would be errant Third World Countries. 
This could set, off a chain reaction, encouraging others to do the same. 

The threshold between conventional and nuclear warfare is becoming less 
distinct. This does not augur well for the future.

DOE nuclear waste transportation policies questioned 
By Steven Friederich - Journal Writer

POCATELLO - Spent nuclear fuel might have traveled down Interstate 15 last 
month, within hundreds of yards of residential homes, and the public wasn't 
notified.

Nuclear watchdog groups are now calling for a renewed look at DOE's nuclear 
waste transportation policies. And earlier this year, the National Academy of 
Sciences - which provides scientific advice to Congressional officials - 
convened a committee to look at the issue. 
  

The Department of Energy announced last month it would send an unspecified 
number of spent nuclear reactor fuel rods to the Idaho National Engineering 
and Environmental Laboratory from its Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 
Tennessee.

Neither DOE nor Bechtel Jacobs, the company that operates the Oak Ridge site 
for DOE, would disclose the timing or the route for the five planned 
shipments. 

Dennis Hill, spokesman for Bechtel Jacobs, did say the fuel would be 
traveling sometime in November by large trucks using giant protective 
canisters to hold the spent nuclear fuel.

If the fuel did travel by truck, and there's no way to confirm it did because 
DOE spokesman Joe Davis and Hill both cited national security concerns for 
not releasing additional details, the shipment's most direct route would have 
taken it almost 2,000 miles through seven states - Tennessee, Illinois, 
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. 

An online travel calculator estimated the trip would take about 30 hours.

"We think people along the routes should be told it's coming through," said 
Pocatello Regional Director Beatrice Brailsford, of the local nuclear 
watchdog group Snake River Alliance. "The government has always treated these 
shipments with a good deal of secrecy. They think if we're ignorant, we're 
safe." 

Chuck Broscious, of the local Environmental Defense Institute, also openly 
objects to not informing the public when nuclear waste travels through 
communities.

Mayor Roger Chase and City Council members Harry Neuhardt and Richard 
Stallings said they haven't been notified a shipment took place. Local police 
officials also recently stated they were unaware of any spent nuclear fuel 
shipments.  
 

A federal contract requires all Oak Ridge spent fuel to be removed from its 
Milton Valley site by 2006, Hill said. INEEL received 40 percent of Oak 
Ridge's total spent nuclear fuel rods and the rest went to a receiving basin 
at DOE's Savannah River site in Georgia, Hill said.

The account of the Oak Ridge fuel follows a similar example from earlier this 
year when local leaders weren't notified. 

According to news reports, a seven-car train carrying spent nuclear fuel rods 
departed Ashford, New York - about 45 miles south of Buffalo - shortly after 
midnight on July 13 and arrived at INEEL four days later. The train carried 
125 irradiated bundles of fuel rods and was shipped 2,360 miles by rail 
without informing local officials, emergency first responders or the public 
along the route.

"At least tell the fire chief," Bill King, town supervisor of Ashford told 
the news media at the time. "These volunteer firefighters are the ones who 
come running any time of day or night to respond to emergencies. If they're 
not prepared and on notice, it threatens them and it threatens the 
community."  
 

Both shipments are authorized by the state's court-enforced 1995 nuclear 
waste cleanup agreement. The government is allowed to send 13 truck shipments 
of high-level waste a year to INEEL through 2012, which is down from 20 
truckloads a year before 2003.

Even so, the 1995 agreement doesn't allow anymore than 497 truck shipments 
before all of the waste has to be removed in 2035. 

According to DOE, there have been more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear 
fuel and there has never been a release of radioactive material harmful to 
the public or the environment. Spent nuclear fuel also cannot explode and is 
not a bomb. In fact, through the protective transportation containers, it 
emits very little radiation.

In March of this year, the National Academy of Sciences created the 
Transportation of Radioactive Waste Committee with 15 university professors 
and scientists from some of the most prestigious universities in the country. 
Their goal will be to draft a formal recommendation to Congress by March 2005 
on what to do about nuclear waste transportation.

The committee has met three times, according to the Academy, though key 
members refuse to comment on the committee's activities like Julian Agyeman, 
an associate professor at Tufts University in Massachusetts and professor 
Hank Jenkins-Smith of Texas A&M University. Both are studying the public 
perception of the nuclear industry.

In August, Public Citizen - a government watchdog group founded by former 
presidential candidate Ralph Nader - sent a letter to the National Academy of 
Sciences questioning DOE's procedures in the Ashland shipment.

"We are deeply troubled that the DOE secretly moved this shipment under the 
cover of darkness early on a Sunday morning without notifying the public," 
wrote Lisa Gue, Public Citizen's senior energy analyst in the Aug. 11 dated 
letter.

"While we do not dispute the need to address the national security 
implications of nuclear waste transportation, we are not convinced that this 
level of secrecy is justified, or that it meaningfully reduced risks," she 
said. "On the contrary, such secrecy fundamentally conflicts with the 
principles of government transparency and accountability essential to 
protecting the public interest."

Brendan Hoffman, a Public Citizen energy specialist, said the recent truck 
shipment through Pocatello adds to the controversy because local leaders 
continue not to be notified.

"The whole national security argument is ridiculous," he said. "If you want 
to find the shipment, you'll find it."

Hoffman said the public should be notified at least a week in advance because 
though the likelihood of an accident is small, "For anyone who wants to get 
out of town, they should have the option."

Stallings, a four-term U.S. representative and a former nuclear waste 
negotiator for the Clinton administration, said I-15 has seen tons of spent 
fuel and other nuclear materials cross its pavement, but has never had a 
major accident.

"I'd be more scared of what's going over our railroads than the nuclear 
material on our highways," he said.

In an interview with PBS's Frontline, Stallings said transporting nuclear 
waste emotionally scares people beyond belief - even in an area like 
Pocatello, which has had hundreds of its citizens work at INEEL.

"When we raised the issue that people would be carrying spent fuel through 
the railroad yards in Pocatello, or that trucks would be bringing it through 
I-15 É and does that make you nervous, the numbers just go off the scale," he 
said. "There's tremendous fear that's somehow there's going to be an accident 
and their kids are going to be affected for their life. It's unreal. It's not 
likely to happen. And yet it's hard to convince people otherwise."

Pantex officials update neighbors on environmental issues 
12/02/2003 
Associated Press 

Environmental monitoring is continuing at the Pantex plant, say officials who 
are also updating cleanup plans at the nuclear weapons facility. 

Panhandle residents were briefed Monday on well monitoring and environmental 
remediation plans in a quarterly update. Pantex is the nation's primary 
assembly and disassembly plant for nuclear warheads. 

Plant officials are analyzing data and writing reports, said Dennis 
Huddleston, manager of environmental remediation for BWXT Pantex. Huddleston 
presented information on the risk-based end state vision, a plan to 
standardize cleanups across all sites. 

"It will bring consistency and a common-sense approach to cleanup," he told 
the Amarillo Globe-News in Tuesday's online edition. 

Included in the plan are corrective measures to reduce risk at all sites 
beginning by May 2005. 

Information on an airborne geophysics progress report was presented by Jeff 
Paine, an investigator for Pantex from the economic geology division of 
University of Texas at Austin. The report measures conductivity on sites 
around the plant to detect changes in the sediment type and water saturation. 

Jeri Osborne, a Pantex neighbor, said information on an airborne 
electromagnetic survey was of interest because those planes fly directly over 
her home. 

"I try to get enough information to ask the right questions," she said, 
adding there was no alarming information in Monday's presentations.

Commission advocates lab competition
By Andrea Widener
CONTRA COSTA TIMES

A long-anticipated report has found that managers of federal research labs 
should regularly compete to continue running the science facilities, a 
judgment that could have a major impact on the University of California.

Among its most controversial conclusions is that Lawrence Livermore and Los 
Alamos labs contracts should be bid separately, which would likely make 
competition easier for an outsider and harder for UC. The university has run 
the two weapons labs uninterrupted for more than half a century.

The report by the so-called Blue Ribbon Commission found that competition 
would benefit the labs and recommended a process to better link lab 
performance to the competition decision. At the same time, it recognized 
problems with the Department of Energy's lab oversight, which often gave labs 
high marks even when there were major management failures.

"The principles arguing for free and open competition and (the) benefits to 
be gained through competition could address the management problems perceived 
in the current operation of the laboratories," the report states.

The commission has been controversial since its beginning, when several 
people complained the group was weighted toward favoring competition and that 
it included a Defense Department official on leave from the University of 
Texas -- a potential UC competitor to run the weapons labs.

A skeptic of the commission's makeup, Rep. Ellen Tauscher said she was not 
surprised with the findings that competition is necessary and that UC's labs 
should be bid separately.

"I do not think that they have any significant reasoning behind their 
decision not to have" Los Alamos and Livermore competed together, said 
Tauscher, D-Alamo, who represents the area that includes Lawrence Livermore 
and Sandia/California. "They were meant to answer the hard questions. What 
they have done is kick a hard question down the street."

Commission member Jacques Gansler said the group met with people of every 
point of view, and he thought it was an open and fair process. He said the 
group was not swayed by arguments that the weapons labs should be run by the 
same manager.

"We were truly independent," said Gansler, interim dean and professor at the 
University of Maryland's school of public affairs. "... We weren't convinced 
that (joint management) was the overriding consideration."

The report was spurred by a DOE decision this spring to make the university 
compete to continue running Los Alamos after 60 years as its sole manager -- 
a move spurred by business and management problems at the New Mexico lab. A 
recent Congressional decision forced competition for all contracts older than 
50 years, including UC's other labs, Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence 
Berkeley, a multidisciplinary science lab.

The commission examined management of Energy Department labs nationwide. Its 
conclusions are not binding on the DOE, which oversees 18 major contractor-
operated labs, but they are sure to be influential on future searches for new 
lab managers.

Competition has been the agency's stated policy for years. But it only bid 
contracts when something has gone wrong, so competition is seen as punitive, 
Gansler said.

"In a sense, you've got to start over now (with this report). It is a new set 
of rules," he said.

Scott Sudduth, who oversees governmental relations at UC, said the commission 
recognizes that there have been problems with previous reviews.

"The public perception is that UC has had its hand slapped by having the labs 
competed, and no one -- absolutely no one -- has questioned the university's 
stewardship of the fundamental mission of the labs," Sudduth said. "I think 
the commission is recognizing that the process is partly to blame for that."

The report sets out a new process that allows excellent managers to have 
their contract extended for up to 20 years, but it could be competed as 
regularly as every five years. They also sets up a new, more rigorous 
evaluation procedure that brings in outside panels and high-level DOE 
management to decide how lab managers are performing.

In competition itself, the group recognized that nonprofits may be at a 
disadvantage in an open competition that could cost $3 million to $5 million, 
so it recommended a grant of up to $2 million.

Tauscher said only giving nonprofits half the necessary amount was 
ridiculous. "It is a big problem, and we're going to give you half a 
solution," she said.

UC was glad to see the commission recognized the special problems for 
nonprofits, Sudduth said, but contends competition could cost $10 million or 
more.

Despite the commission's findings, Sudduth said UC continues to believe the 
Los Alamos and Livermore contracts should be competed together. "We will 
continue to make the case, and we think there are others that will make the 
case, that you don't want to rock the apple cart when it comes to the 
nation's nuclear deterrent."

The report will be reviewed at a Dec. 10 meeting. A full copy of the report, 
and more information, is available at www.seab.doe.gov/news.htm.

No Utah site will take 'hot' waste from Ohio, N.Y. 
By Judy Fahys 
The Salt Lake Tribune 

    A southeastern Utah uranium recycler is not in the running as a possible 
burial ground for highly concentrated radioactive waste from two 
controversial government cleanups. 

  Officials at the International Uranium Corp. White Mesa uranium mill have 
confirmed the company never planned to bid for waste from Ohio and New York. 

  With the decision last week by Envirocare of Utah to drop its federal 
application to receive the waste -- and International Uranium out of the 
picture -- there are no commercial facilities in Utah eligible to accept the 
13,000 cubic yards of radioactive material from government cleanups in 
Fernald, Ohio, and Niagara Falls, N.Y. 

  International Uranium President Ron Hochstein noted that his company is 
not licensed for "direct disposal" of the K-65 waste, like the stuff stored 
in two silos at Fernald. Even though the mill has recycled mildly 
contaminated tailings from similar uranium ore in the past, his company would 
not seek the license change needed for White Mesa to be considered, he said. 

  "Silos 1 and 2 are too hot for us to handle," said Hochstein, whose 
company is one of San Juan County's biggest employers. 

  In fact, none of the nation's commercial storage sites -- including the 
two in Utah -- has the government approvals needed to accept the waste. 

  Congress helped clear the way for commercial disposal of the K-65 sludge 
with passage last week of the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. The bill 
reclassified the unusually concentrated radium waste so that it could be 
buried in a surface landfill rather than in a government-owned underground 
disposal site as originally proposed. 

  "We are going to continue to pursue all the options we can," said Jeff 
Wagner, a spokesman for Fluor Fernald, the contractor for the Fernald 
cleanup. 

  "Our interest is to make sure we find a safe home for this waste and can 
do it in an efficient and cost-effective manner," he added, "and [we] can do 
it on our closure schedule of 2006." 

  Fluor Fernald had been looking for years for a way to send the K-65 waste 
to Envirocare's privately owned radioactive and hazardous waste landfill in 
Tooele County, rather than sending it to the government-owned Nevada Test 
Site. The contractor, the U.S. Energy Department's choice for the $1.4 
billion cleanup, described Envirocare as the safest and cheapest option for 
disposing of the waste, which, untreated and undiluted, is roughly 125 times 
more concentrated than currently allowed in Utah. 

  Radium emits penetrating gamma rays, as well as alpha radiation, a known 
carcinogen. It is considered a hazard to human health and the environment 
forever. 

  Envirocare had asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase 
its license for uranium byproduct waste from its current 4,000 picocuries 
radium per gram of waste to 100,000 picocuries radium per gram. But the 
company promised U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and state legislators that it 
would not pursue the license change until Utah takes over the byproduct 
regulation program from the NRC -- a switch that is not expected to be 
complete until next spring. 

  Envirocare also faced mounting public concern about the plans, which 
clash with the state's current policy of only taking mildly tainted 
radioactive waste. 

  The company's withdrawal dashed the Energy Department's plans to use the 
Utah site. It also jeopardizes Fluor Fernald's hopes of getting a $215 
million performance bonus for getting the job done by a December 2006 
deadline. 

  By dropping its license-change request, Envirocare will lose out on the 
$14 million Ohio contract -- a contract the company claimed in an Oct. 21 
advertisement that would also be sought by "competitors in Colorado and 
Texas." 

  Commercial facilities in Washington and South Carolina are not licensed 
by the NRC to accept uranium byproduct waste. Low-level facilities in Idaho, 
Texas, Colorado and White Mesa also do not have the proper government 
licenses. 

  Said Myron Fliegel, who was reviewing Envirocare's license amendment for 
the NRC: "I don't know that there's a viable [uranium byproduct] facility 
that could take it." 

  Although Fluor Fernald is looking for other options, it appears 
Envirocare was its best and only hope for commercial disposal. 

  Fluor Fernald, the contractor cleaning up the uranium mill site in Ohio, 
now is proceeding with its plans to haul the waste cross-country to a 
government-owned disposal facility at the Nevada Test Site. The company would 
not disclose whether the waste would travel through Utah on its way to Nevada 
for fear of sharing sensitive information with would-be terrorists.

EPA completes cleanup of polluted land six months early
12/3/2003 10:44 PM
By: Estacion, Mary

    
 Work to clean up the former Tex Tin plant.   
It's been quite a few years since Abel Garza worked at the old Tex Tin 
facility in Texas City.

"We didn't even use gas masks," Garza says. "You had to put your own 
handkerchief, whatever you had in your pocket, to put over your face."

But that was then, this is now. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency led 
an effort to clean up the 170-acre site, with workers covered in protective 
gear.

"It had enormous amounts of hazards, chemicals, acids pits, radioactive 
material," Myron Knudson says.

Fifteen tons of that radioactive material was disposed of, along with 50 tons 
of the byproduct used in the tin smelting process -- a Superfund site cleaned 
up six months ahead of schedule and $10 million under budget.

"This is a model for EPA, as I've been told by the Region 6 administrator," 
Mayor Carlos Garza says.

Land that was once filled with hazardous material could now be used as a 
major port in Texas City. Mary Estacion explains.

As city officials consider the future of Tex Tin, Mayor Garza says he hopes 
to make the newly available land a big part of the city's plan to build a 
megaport.

"We have a tentative commitment from Stevedoring Services of America. SSA 
plans on using half of it for an intermodal yard, where they will spur into 
the railroad tracks to bring in containers
as well as load new containers onto it for ships throughout the United States 
region," Mayor Garza says.

But there's still work left to do. Swan Lake, contaminated by some waste 
products from the Tex Tin plant, borders Galveston Bay. So jetties are being 
built to minimize any environmental impact. 

EPA officials say only one Superfund site in the Houston-Galveston area 
remains on their priority list.

Malone Services, a former hazardous waste storage facility in Texas City, was 
put on the list two years ago.

Its cleanup is still in the planning stages.

UC faculty stunned by Berkeley lab bid plan 
Out-of-state school would win contract 

Keay Davidson, Chronicle Science Writer   Thursday, December 4, 2003 
  
UC Berkeley faculty shuddered Wednesday at the prospects that the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory, their longtime neighbor and a veritable factory 
for Nobel Prizes, could be run by an out-of-state university or even a for-
profit corporation. 

"This would be a major disaster, a really major disaster on top of everything 
else we have to deal with now" in the financially strapped UC system and 
state of California, said Randy Schekman, a professor of cell and 
developmental biology. 

Loss of the University of California's half-century-old job as lab manager 
would be a blow to the state's pride and hurt efforts to attract -- or 
retain -- top students, faculty and investors, shocked faculty said. The 
present contract to run Lawrence Berkeley runs out on Jan. 31. 

The reaction came one day after revelations that President Bush signed 
legislation requiring competition for contracts to manage six national 
laboratories financed by the U.S. Energy Department. Three of those labs are 
run by the University of California: Lawrence Berkeley, in the hills 
overlooking the UC Berkeley campus, the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos, 
N.M. , nuclear weapons labs. 

The other national labs affected by the legislation are in Illinois, Iowa and 
Idaho. 

Following recent financial, managerial and security scandals at Los Alamos, 
embarrassed UC officials had fully expected their punishment -- a forced 
competition for the next five-year contract to run Los Alamos. UC has run 
that lab, where the first atomic bombs were built, since World War II. 

The provision requiring the competitions -- which affects national labs that 
have enjoyed no-bid contracts for 50 years -- was tucked into the $27.3 
billion spending bill by an Ohio Republican, Rep. David Hobson. 

"The idea of having to compete for LBNL is certainly catching us by 
surprise," said Robert G. Jacobsen, vice chair of the physics 
department. "That's not something that we, as individual faculty members, had 
been concerned about." 

Jacobsen fears that in months ahead, uncertainty over who will end up running 
Lawrence Berkeley could adversely affect proposed collaborations among UC 
Berkeley faculty, Lawrence Berkeley lab staffers and outside collaborators. 

Faculty also worry that a new manager -- especially a nonuniversity manager --
 might bureaucratize ties between the main campus and Lawrence Berkeley. That 
might make it harder for faculty to arrange everything from travel to 
conferences and equipment purchases. 

Also, they warn, if an outside owner takes over, it might be tougher for UC 
to attract top faculty. That's partly because campus officials could no 
longer guarantee certain perks to a coveted candidate -- perks such as a 
Lawrence Berkeley job for the candidate's spouse or quick access to Lawrence 
Berkeley's veritable toy store of supercomputers and supergadgets. 

Possible competitors for running any of the contested labs range from outside 
universities, such as the huge University of Texas system, to for- profit 
corporations such as Lockheed Martin, which already runs Sandia National 
Laboratories, to nonprofit research institutions such as Battelle, which runs 
other labs including Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington 
state. 

"It would create a civil war (at UC Berkeley) if (Lawrence Berkeley) were 
managed by some other university -- it would be an intolerable 
circumstance, " Schekman said. "Can you imagine that? The University of Texas 
running LBNL? It would be intolerable. 

"And it (leaves) us facing the most vulnerable position, with further budget 
cuts (statewide). We're in a completely untenable situation. We can't print 
money -- and it might cost millions of dollars just to compete." 

A change in owners for Lawrence Berkeley "could potentially be calamitous, " 
said integrativebiology professor Thomas M. "Zack" Powell, chair of UC 
Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group. "The level of expertise up there (at 
Lawrence Berkeley Lab) is extraordinary -- it's one of those places where you 
walk down the hall and in an office is the world's expert on something or 
other. 

"Some of those people are going to leave (if management changes). They're 
just going to throw up their hands and say, 'I don't want to be managed by a 
corporate entity or a university a half-country away.' " Powell added. "Some 
of those people -- and not just the high-end scientists and technicians -- 
will have no trouble finding a position elsewhere in the Bay Area right 
away .. . and they'll probably get substantially more money." 

Many employees at the Livermore lab "would prefer to retain the UC 
connection," said lab spokesperson Linda Seaver. "Everybody here has sort of 
a wait-and-see attitude." The lab, founded in 1952, has more than 8,000 
employees. 

Asked if officials at the University of Chicago, which manages the Argonne 
National Laboratory in Illinois and its sister lab in Idaho, are upset for 
being sucked into a federal shakeup triggered by UC's alleged mismanagement 
of the Los Alamos lab, University of Chicago spokesperson Larry Arbeiter 
laughed and said: "That's a very good question and I won't answer that on the 
record."

Study finds N.C. power plants emit most toxic chemicals in country 

By EMERY P. DALESIO, , Associated Press Writer

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Power plants in North Carolina pumped more toxic 
chemicals into the atmosphere than those run by electric utilities in any 
other state, a national study by a liberal watchdog group reported Thursday.
The Public Interest Research Group, analyzing 2001 data collected by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, found North Carolina's coal-fired power 
plants belched more than 78 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air in 
2001, the last year for which figures were available. The state's two major 
utilities are Raleigh-based Progress Energy and Charlotte-based Duke Power.
The report found that electric utilities were the biggest air polluters, 
while metal mining accounted for half the pollution of the water and land. 
Nearly 75 percent of the pollution rising from utilities was hydrochloric 
acid and another 16 percent was sulfuric acid.

"We've known for years that these are some of the biggest sources," said 
Martha Keating of Efland, who co-authored the PIRG report. "I guess what's 
new is that we're running up against a political and legal juncture."

The report was released as the Bush administration considers regulations that 
would allow power plant owners to postpone for up to a decade requirements 
that they install specific technology designed to reduce mercury pollution.

"Utilities will be further reducing mercury emissions in the next few years," 
said Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade 
group for the country's utilities.

The PIRG report found that electric utilities in Texas - President Bush's 
home state - were the largest emitters of mercury into the air and water. 
Texas power plants were responsible for about 10 percent of the mercury 
released into the air, the report found.

Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and West Virginia utilities were the next largest 
mercury polluters, combining for 38 percent of the total nationwide.

Mercury is a persistent substance that affects the nervous system and is 
especially dangerous for pregnant women and children. Mercury concentrations 
in fish have prompted at least 43 states to issue fish consumption 
advisories. Forty percent of mercury emissions come from the smokestacks of 
coal-burning power plants, but the emissions have never been regulated as a 
pollutant.

Coal-burning electric generating plants were responsible for 17 percent of 
toxic pollutants nationwide in 2001. That was slightly more than 1 billion 
pounds, down from 1.2 billion pounds in 2000.

North Carolina's power plants were blamed for 11 percent of the national 
total for all toxic chemical releases into the air, the report said.

Duke Power spokesman Tom Williams said while half the company's generating 
capacity comes from coal-burning power plants, the remaining half comes from 
nuclear power.

"We're very proud of our coal plants. They're among the most efficient in the 
nation," Williams said. "All I can say is that our plants have gotten cleaner 
and cleaner."

Sulfur dioxide scrubbers the state's utilities are installing in coming years 
also will remove some mercury emissions, he said.

A spokesman for Raleigh-based Progress Energy did not immediately return 
calls for comment Thursday.

Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, West Virginia and Georgia rounded out the 
dirtiest half-dozen states on PIRG's ranking of power plant pollution. The 
top six states accounted for half the nation's airborne toxic chemical 
releases in 2001, the report said.

On Thursday, the EPA proposed capping emissions of sulfur dioxide and smog-
causing nitrogen oxide from factories and power plants in 30 states, most of 
them east of the Mississippi River. Smog and fine soot, much of it from power 
plants, are blamed for respiratory problems, especially among children and 
the elderly.

Neither sulfur dioxide nor nitrogen oxide is among the toxic chemicals that 
must be reported to the EPA.

Reliant likely to skip buying plant stake
By LAURA GOLDBERG
Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle
Reliant Resources said Friday it's not likely to exercise its option to buy a 
majority stake in the Texas power plant subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy. 

Houston-based CenterPoint Energy holds 81 percent of Texas Genco Holdings, 
with the rest owned by public shareholders. Reliant Resources, which sells 
power on a retail level to consumers under the Reliant Energy brand in 
Houston and elsewhere in Texas, has an option exercisable between Jan. 10 and 
Jan. 24 to purchase CenterPoint's Texas Genco stake. 

Texas Genco has power plants in the Houston area, along with a 30.8 percent 
stake in a nuclear plant in Matagorda County and a plant in Limestone County. 

CenterPoint spokeswoman Leticia Lowe said Friday the company's strategy is to 
sell its Texas Genco stake, whether to Reliant or another buyer. 

A financial adviser has already been hired to help the company explore 
alternatives should Reliant not exercise its option. 

CenterPoint, which plans to use proceeds from a sale to pay down debt, can't 
begin marketing Texas Genco until Reliant's option expires. 

Shares in all three companies closed down Friday. CenterPoint ended down 40 
cents at $9.52, while Reliant closed down 23 cents at $6.16. Shares in Texas 
Genco took the biggest hit, sliding $2.35 to $29.60. 

In a written statement Friday, Joel Staff, Reliant's chairman and chief 
executive, said as the company makes a decision, it is weighing its power 
supply needs for its Texas retail electric business, the cost of the deal and 
impact on earnings. 

Staff said that because Texas Genco's earnings are affected by prices of 
natural gas, buying the stake "would likely add substantial volatility to 
Reliant's earnings." 

He also noted that Reliant already has power supplies under contract to meet 
about two-thirds of next year's projected needs for its retail business and 
to meet a significant portion of 2005's needs. 

Over time, he said, Reliant is likely to buy individual generating assets to 
supplement the power it buys from others.

THE government is to pour £3.4 billion into the pension scheme for health 
service employees in an attempt to deal with a near-£110bn shortfall. The 
cash, which amounts to about 1p on income tax, is being provided because 
payments to existing pensions have soared by 50 per cent in the past five 
years. 

A massive row is looming over "fat-cat" pensions. The government is set to 
publish proposals on Wednesday to limit the amount that can go into 
individual pension pots to £1.4m. Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have 
favoured a £2m limit, because top civil servants would be capped by the plan. 

BNFL is shipping more than £1m-worth of low-level nuclear waste every week to 
a site in Utah run by an Iranian migr who was fined for his role in a 
corruption scandal involving a local regulator.

Company promises to deal with nuclear waste
LOUISIANA ENERGY Services says it will remove waste from proposed plant in 
a 'timely manner.' 


SANTA FE (AP) ÷ The company that wants to build a nuclear fuel plant in New 
Mexico has made a written commitment to remove the plant's nuclear waste in 
a "timely manner."

Louisiana Energy Services promised in a letter Saturday to Gov. Bill 
Richardson to store the waste at its proposed site only temporarily.

LES president Jim Ferland wrote "there will be no disposal or long-term 
storage (beyond the life of the plant) of uranium byproduct cylinders in the 
state of New Mexico."

LES plans to use uranium enriched at the plant, which would be built near 
Hobbs, to fuel nuclear power plants around the world.

Opponents are concerned the plant's radioactive waste could end up stored on 
the plant site indefinitely because there is no place to get rid of it.

The waste requires processing before it can be shipped to a low-level nuclear 
waste dump, but there is not a U.S. waste facility capable of doing that.

Ferland committed to work with a private company outside of New Mexico to get 
rid of the waste. In addition, LES plans to post a bond worth $27 million 
each year the plant operates to ensure that there will be enough money 
available to get rid of the waste.

Ferland's letter is an attempt to clear up a controversy created over a 
provision added to the failed energy bill by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who 
is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee.

The provision would have forced the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to act 
within two years on an application by LES, which has been trying to build the 
plant since the late 1980s.

It also provided a method for the federal government to take responsibility 
for the waste. Richardson's office feared that provision would mean the waste 
would end up sitting at the New Mexico facility because the federal 
government has no way to deal with the waste.

LES officials said Saturday they do not intend to use the provision in 
Domenici's proposed legislation.

"It's been LES's intention all along to find an appropriate disposal path, 
and that in our minds has always been a private facility," company spokesman 
Doug Turner said.

It is unclear what the government would do with LES waste.

Secrecy doesn't help waste issue
Monday, December 08, 2003 - 12:00 AM 
The Daily Herald 
  
Want to know why Utahns are distrustful of the government's original plan to 
bring radioactive waste from Fernald, Ohio, to Utah?

It might have to do with the Department of Energy's unwillingness to respond 
to questions in a timely manner.

The Daily Herald has tried since October to contact DOE officials about the 
Fernald cleanup.It's now two months later, and we're still waiting for 
answers to several questions, including:

 --   Why didn't DOE try to get regular legislation introduced to reclassify 
Fernald's uranium tailings rather than use last-minute amendments tacked on 
after the bills had been debated? Does it prefer secrecy?

 --   Why did the DOE change its mind about disposing of the material at the 
Nevada Test Site and push for Envirocare of Utah instead?

 --   Why did the department conduct public hearings on the Fernald cleanup in 
New Mexico, Nevada, Tennessee, Missouri, California, Washington, D.C., Texas 
and South Carolina -- but not in Utah -- when it changed plans and decided to 
send the waste to Envirocare's facility in Tooele County? Shouldn't the 
people of Utah have had a chance to speak on this subject before the waste 
showed up at their doorstep?

 --   If Nevada won't take the stuff, and Envirocare can't take it, what 
happens? It obviously can't stay in Ohio.

These are all fair questions, the answers to which would enhance public 
understanding of this issue. The DOE's reluctance to answer fuels the 
suspicion, reasonable or not, that something foul is afoot.

The unresponsiveness further fuels the mistrust Utahns understandably have of 
the government on radioactive matters. Government officials said that the 
above-ground atomic tests in Nevada posed no threat, and many Utahns paid the 
ultimate price for that.

If the Department of Energy is seeking a receptive audience in Utah, it needs 
to be willing to answer questions and allow residents to make informed 
decisions. If it can't, then it has only itself to blame when public opinion 
is based on an incomplete set of facts.

CALIFORNIA TO SOUTH CAROLINA
Nuclear reactor set for journey
By Bruce Henderson
Knight Ridder

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Few retirees could ever have gone to such lengths to 
relocate in rural Barnwell as a decommissioned nuclear reactor waiting to be 
shipped from San Onofre, Calif.

Barnwell's low-level nuclear waste site is the only port in an awfully long 
storm for the 770-ton reactor vessel. It has been shunned by railroads, 
Panama Canal authorities and a West Coast dump.

So Southern California Edison will do what it must: barge its radioactive 
cargo 11,000 miles by way of Cape Horn, at the tip of South America. The 
voyage will take three months.

Taking the scenic route to Barnwell illustrates a larger problem: what to do 
with America's retired nuclear plant parts.

Barnwell is the only site open to waste from throughout the United States. 
But that will change in 2008, when it will close to all states except South 
Carolina, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Seventeen reactors are being decommissioned, said the Nuclear Energy 
Institute, an industry group. Fifty-one of the nation's 103 operating 
reactors have had licenses renewed, are under review or are expected to ask 
for extensions.

"This is a real question: Where are these things going to go? What's going to 
happen to them in the future?" said Tom Clements of Greenpeace International.

Many shut-down reactors will simply stay put, an option environmental groups 
favor.

But industry experts acknowledge there's no final solution to low-level 
waste, the mildly radioactive debris includes dirty rags and reactor 
components.

A 1980 federal law meant to establish regional disposal sites hasn't overcome 
political resistance to them. North Carolina is being sued by other 
Southeastern states for failing to open a replacement site for Barnwell.

A private site in Utah is licensed to accept only the most lightly 
contaminated low-level waste. Another in Richland, Wash., is open only to 
Northwestern and Rocky Mountain states. Texas is moving toward opening a low-
level site, but it, too, would limit access.

Duke Power sends its low-level wastes to Barnwell and to Utah.

Barnwell, meanwhile, stands at a crossroad. It earns South Carolina millions 
but also symbolizes the state's unwanted reputation as a nuclear dumping 
ground.

Gov. Mark Sanford has been briefed on the coming reactor, spokesman Will 
Folks said.

"The governor has said all along that we need to strike a balance between the 
economic development of our nuclear facilities, like Barnwell and the 
Savannah River Site, and the need to protect our environment," Folks said. 
Barnwell's future beyond 2008, he said, "is a long way down the road."

Four reactor vessels already have been entombed at Barnwell, most recently 
one from Michigan's Big Rock Point plant in October. Other than San Onofre, 
one more reactor is scheduled to be buried there in July 2004 from the 
Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Plant, said Chem-Nuclear Systems, the company that 
runs Barnwell.

"As far as we're concerned, a reactor pressure vessel is the same waste as we 
take in through the gate everyday," spokesman Deborah Ogilvie said. "It's 
just in a bigger package."

Southern California Edison last week got a key government permit for the 
reactor's trip, which will begin with its being rolled 15 miles down a beach.

Decommissioning the San Onofre reactor, which operated from 1968 to 1992, 
will take eight years and $600 million. Two other reactors are still 
operating at the plant.

Now filled with concrete, the retired reactor vessel emits relatively little 
radiation. Standing beside it for an hour would equal half a chest X-ray, 
officials say.

Even so, Greenpeace says shipping such parts needlessly exposes the public to 
radiation and the risk of accidents.

No departure date is set.

Once in Charleston, the reactor will ride the 120 miles to Barnwell on a rail 
car.

State moves ahead with radioactive waste process

BC-TX--Radioactive Waste, Bjt,0530 

State moves ahead with radioactive waste process 

snglf 

By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer 

AUSTIN (AP) -- State regulators approved rules Wednesday that companies are 
to follow when they apply to run a planned low-level radioactive waste site 
in West Texas. 

"It's a big step," said Susan Jablonski of the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality. "Having the rules out there allows everybody to know 
what the rules of this commission (are) going to be." 

Lawmakers in the spring approved a bill that allows for the creation of two 
privately-run waste disposal facilities licensed by the state. 

One would handle waste under a compact between Texas, Vermont and Maine, 
although Maine has since dropped out of the compact. A separate but adjacent 
facility would take U.S. Department of Energy waste. 

The rules adopted by the TCEQ lay out what the application has to include, 
such as financial security and the technical requirements. The rules also 
list the criteria for evaluating multiple applications, Jablonski said. 

"If they are going to apply, you want them to put their best foot forward," 
Jablonski said. "We want applications that have all the information that we 
need in order to evaluate them." 

Jablonski said it will be at least the end of 2007 before a license is 
awarded. 

Rep. Lon Burnam, a Democrat from Fort Worth who fought against the bill in 
the Legislature, said the commissioners passed "pretty good rules." 

"While I think the law is a horrible anti-public interest bill that should 
have never passed in the first place, the commission has done more good than 
I thought they may have been able to pull off," Burnam said. 

He applauded the commissioners' decision that the applications be posted on 
the Internet and said the commissioners expressed a willingness to consider 
creating a citizen oversight panel, something he supports. 

Jablonski said the commissioners are open to a citizen advisory committee but 
want to talk further about how it would be constructed. She said such a 
committee did not have to be set up now. 

Michael Woodward, an attorney who represents Dallas-based Waste Control 
Specialists, said the company was excited that the rules have been adopted so 
it can move forward with the application process. He said the company will 
seek the license to operate the waste site. 

"Any facility licensed under these rules, which provide very strict criteria, 
will be protective of health and the environment," Woodward said. 

The TCEQ also approved a rule change on how it treats pollution released by a 
company either by accident, during routine maintenance or when a facility 
shuts down or starts up. Under the new rule, the emission releases either 
have to be permitted for or they would be considered a violation if the 
company couldn't prove the releases were unavoidable. 

The TCEQ was under pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency to 
change the rule.

Council concerned about waste 
Resident wants landfill policy re-examined. 
Thursday, December 18, 2003
By JEFF SCHOGOL 
The Express-Times 

PLAINFIELD TWP. -- Grand Central Sanitary Landfill accepts low-level 
radioactive waste, landfill operations manager Bruce Fahs said Wednesday. 

Fahs testified during a public hearing on Waste Management Inc.'s application 
to expand Grand Central by about 43 acres. 
   
     
Wednesday marked the ninth hearing on the matter since Sept. 11. 

Fahs said if the landfill's radiation detectors go off when a truck drives 
by, the truck is inspected. 

In some situations, Waste Management must call the state Department of 
Environmental Protection which decides if the truck can dump its load or not, 
Fahs said. 

Fahs said the DEP has allowed trucks to dump low-level radioactive waste at 
the landfill but only if it has determined the waste does not pose a health 
risk. 

Fahs noted that radiation is a naturally occurring phenomenon. One source of 
low level radioactive waste is iodine, which is used in medical procedures, 
he said. 

Another source of low-level radiation is discarded wrist watches, said Waste 
Management spokesman Harry Smith. 

Waste Management attorney Anthony Martino said the landfill accepts 
a "minuscule" amount of low-level radioactive waste. 

But Pen Argyl is concerned about the low-level radioactive waste, so much so 
that it monitors landfill leachate treated at the borough's sewage treatment 
plant for radiation, said borough Councilman David De Palma. 

Washington Township resident Sherry Darr asked why Waste Management needs 
radiation detectors to know if a truck is carrying low-level radioactive 
waste. 

Darr said Waste Management should know which trucks have low-level 
radioactive waste beforehand. Those trucks should be tested before they reach 
the landfill and clearly identified if they contain low-level radioactive 
waste, she said. 

She said she did not think any radioactive waste should be allowed in the 
landfill at all. 

She also said she is not confident in the DEP's ability to investigate 
radioactive incidents based on their poor track record investigating odor 
complaints. 

Darr said she wants to know if there are public records detailing how much 
low-level radioactive waste is being disposed of at the landfill and where it 
comes from. 

Township supervisors Chairman Randy Lieberman said he was unaware that low-
level radioactive waste was being dumped at the landfill. 

Lieberman said the board of supervisors would be concerned about the waste. 

Processed infectious waste was another topic at Wednesday's hearing. 

Martino submitted a letter from the DEP stating the landfill accepts only 
processed infectious waste. 

Supervisors were concerned when they learned in October that the landfill 
accepted processed infectious waste. But the landfill can only accept 
infectious waste that has been disinfected, according to a letter from 
William Tomayko of the DEP. 

Even so, the supervisors must determine if the township zoning ordinance 
allows the landfill to accept any infectious waste, processed or otherwise, 
said township Solicitor David Backenstoe. 

Supervisors also must determine if the zoning ordinance's provision for 
infectious waste is preempted by state regulations, Backenstoe said. 

Also Wednesday, landfill engineer Jan Hutwelker presented supervisors with 
more information about the health risk assessment commissioned by Waste 
Management. 

The health risk assessment concluded that the landfill poses no health risk 
to the public. 

Hutwelker gave supervisors information about where dust samples were taken as 
well as descriptions of weather conditions when the samples were taken. 

Pen Argyl solicitor Peter Layman noted that the data on wind direction taken 
at the landfill's meteorological station was different from data taken at 
dust sampling points. 

Hutwelker acknowledged the conflicting data and said it is difficult to 
determine the direction of the wind when it is calm. 

Layman said the disparity could mean the data is flawed or it could mean that 
wind swirls at the landfill, making it difficult to stop litter and dust from 
blowing off the site. 

The landfill expansion hearing scheduled for today was canceled because Waste 
Management did not have a witness ready, Backenstoe said.

Nuclear plant operators want extension on repair

The Associated Press

BAY CITY - Operators of a Southeast Texas nuclear plant have asked the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend until February the time it has to 
repair a failed emergency diesel generator, a spokesman for the plant said 
Wednesday.

Workers at the South Texas Project in Bay City believe a rod in one of six 
diesel generators used in emergencies was flawed and had microcracks, 
resulting in the generator's failure during a test Dec. 9, project spokesman 
Ed Conaway said.

The generators would be used if the plant's off-site power failed.

The commission has given the plant until Tuesday to make the repairs, or the 
reactor connected to the emergency generator might have to be shut down. The 
commission requires three emergency diesel generators for each nuclear 
reactor.

Conaway said workers plan to inspect rods in the other five generators as 
well.

Only one emergency generator is needed to keep each of the plant's two 
reactors operational in case of a power failure, he said

Landfill says it's not too nuclear 

"Low-level" waste not there, they say. 

Saturday, December 20, 2003

By JEFF SCHOGOL 
The Express-Times 

PLAINFIELD TWP. -- When Grand Central Sanitary Landfill Operations Manager 
Bruce Fahs said Wednesday the landfill accepts low-level radioactive waste, 
he meant "harmless" radioactive waste. 

That according to Waste Management spokesman Harry Smith who said the company 
plans to run an advertisement purchased by the landfill owner to "present 
accurate information." The ad is scheduled to run during the final week of 
this year. 
     
The topic came up at Wednesday's expansion hearings 

Waste Management has applied to expand the landfill by about 43 acres. The 
matter is now before Plainfield Township supervisors. 

Asked Wednesday if the landfill accepts low-level radioactive waste, Fahs 
said, "Yes." 

Smith said on Friday Fahs' answer needs to be clarified. 

A draft of the advertisement provided by Smith says the landfill does not 
accept low-level radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive waste must be 
transported to South Carolina, Texas or Utah, it says. 

However, some waste disposed of at the landfill does contain harmless 
radioactive isotopes, the advertisement says. 

Some of the waste dumped at the landfill contains low-activity, harmless 
radioactive isotopes, the advertisement says. Most of the radioactivity comes 
from "life-saving medical treatments," and those radioactive isotopes lose 
their energy in a few hours or days, it says. 

Smith said statements he and Fahs made at Wednesday's landfill expansion 
hearing about low-level radioactive waste that the landfill accepts in fact 
refer to this harmless waste. 

Waste Management attorney Anthony Martino said Friday he also was referring 
to harmless waste when he said at Wednesday's hearing the landfill accepts 
a "miniscule" amount of low-level radioactive waste. 

In 2000, the state Department of Environmental Protection required landfills 
to inspect all incoming waste for radioactivity, the advertisement says. 
Trucks carrying "unacceptable waste" are rejected, the advertisement says. 

Still, Pen Argyl is concerned, said Councilman David De Palma. 

The borough monitors landfill leachate treated at its sewer plant for 
radiation, De Palma said. Pen Argyl has not detected any radiation since it 
started monitoring the leachate about a year ago, he said. 

Leachate is the liquid runoff that has percolated through the garbage in the 
landfill. 

Smith said Pen Argyl need not be concerned about radiation, but De Palma said 
the borough will continue monitoring the leachate for radiation. 

The state made the landfill install the radiation monitors for a reason, De 
Palma said. He also said the landfill accepted waste before it was mandated 
to install radiation detectors. 

Radioactivity is a naturally occurring phenomenon.

DOE nuclear waste transportation policies questioned

By Steven Friederich - Journal Writer

POCATELLO - Spent nuclear fuel might have traveled down Interstate 15 last 
month, within hundreds of yards of residential homes, and the public wasn't 
notified.


Nuclear watchdog groups are now calling for a renewed look at DOE's nuclear 
waste transportation policies. And earlier this year, the National Academy of 
Sciences - which provides scientific advice to Congressional officials - 
convened a committee to look at the issue.


The Department of Energy announced last month it would send an unspecified 
number of spent nuclear reactor fuel rods to the Idaho National Engineering 
and Environmental Laboratory from its Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 
Tennessee.


Neither DOE nor Bechtel Jacobs, the company that operates the Oak Ridge site 
for DOE, would disclose the timing or the route for the five planned 
shipments.


Dennis Hill, spokesman for Bechtel Jacobs, did say the fuel would be 
traveling sometime in November by large trucks using giant protective 
canisters to hold the spent nuclear fuel.


If the fuel did travel by truck, and there's no way to confirm it did because 
DOE spokesman Joe Davis and Hill both cited national security concerns for 
not releasing additional details, the shipment's most direct route would have 
taken it almost 2,000 miles through seven states - Tennessee, Illinois, 
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho.


An online travel calculator estimated the trip would take about 30 hours.


"We think people along the routes should be told it's coming through," said 
Pocatello Regional Director Beatrice Brailsford, of the local nuclear 
watchdog group Snake River Alliance. "The government has always treated these 
shipments with a good deal of secrecy. They think if we're ignorant, we're 
safe."


Chuck Broscious, of the local Environmental Defense Institute, also openly 
objects to not informing the public when nuclear waste travels through 
communities.


Mayor Roger Chase and City Council members Harry Neuhardt and Richard 
Stallings said they haven't been notified a shipment took place. Local police 
officials also recently stated they were unaware of any spent nuclear fuel 
shipments.


A federal contract requires all Oak Ridge spent fuel to be removed from its 
Milton Valley site by 2006, Hill said. INEEL received 40 percent of Oak 
Ridge's total spent nuclear fuel rods and the rest went to a receiving basin 
at DOE's Savannah River site in Georgia, Hill said.


The account of the Oak Ridge fuel follows a similar example from earlier this 
year when local leaders weren't notified.


According to news reports, a seven-car train carrying spent nuclear fuel rods 
departed Ashford, New York - about 45 miles south of Buffalo - shortly after 
midnight on July 13 and arrived at INEEL four days later. The train carried 
125 irradiated bundles of fuel rods and was shipped 2,360 miles by rail 
without informing local officials, emergency first responders or the public 
along the route.


"At least tell the fire chief," Bill King, town supervisor of Ashford told 
the news media at the time. "These volunteer firefighters are the ones who 
come running any time of day or night to respond to emergencies. If they're 
not prepared and on notice, it threatens them and it threatens the community."


Both shipments are authorized by the state's court-enforced 1995 nuclear 
waste cleanup agreement. The government is allowed to send 13 truck shipments 
of high-level waste a year to INEEL through 2012, which is down from 20 
truckloads a year before 2003.


Even so, the 1995 agreement doesn't allow anymore than 497 truck shipments 
before all of the waste has to be removed in 2035.


According to DOE, there have been more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear 
fuel and there has never been a release of radioactive material harmful to 
the public or the environment. Spent nuclear fuel also cannot explode and is 
not a bomb. In fact, through the protective transportation containers, it 
emits very little radiation.


In March of this year, the National Academy of Sciences created the 
Transportation of Radioactive Waste Committee with 15 university professors 
and scientists from some of the most prestigious universities in the country. 
Their goal will be to draft a formal recommendation to Congress by March 2005 
on what to do about nuclear waste transportation.


The committee has met three times, according to the Academy, though key 
members refuse to comment on the committee's activities like Julian Agyeman, 
an associate professor at Tufts University in Massachusetts and professor 
Hank Jenkins-Smith of Texas A&M University. Both are studying the public 
perception of the nuclear industry.


In August, Public Citizen - a government watchdog group founded by former 
presidential candidate Ralph Nader - sent a letter to the National Academy of 
Sciences questioning DOE's procedures in the Ashland shipment.


"We are deeply troubled that the DOE secretly moved this shipment under the 
cover of darkness early on a Sunday morning without notifying the public," 
wrote Lisa Gue, Public Citizen's senior energy analyst in the Aug. 11 dated 
letter.


"While we do not dispute the need to address the national security 
implications of nuclear waste transportation, we are not convinced that this 
level of secrecy is justified, or that it meaningfully reduced risks," she 
said. "On the contrary, such secrecy fundamentally conflicts with the 
principles of government transparency and accountability essential to 
protecting the public interest."


Brendan Hoffman, a Public Citizen energy specialist, said the recent truck 
shipment through Pocatello adds to the controversy because local leaders 
continue not to be notified.


"The whole national security argument is ridiculous," he said. "If you want 
to find the shipment, you'll find it."


Hoffman said the public should be notified at least a week in advance because 
though the likelihood of an accident is small, "For anyone who wants to get 
out of town, they should have the option."


Stallings, a four-term U.S. representative and a former nuclear waste 
negotiator for the Clinton administration, said I-15 has seen tons of spent 
fuel and other nuclear materials cross its pavement, but has never had a 
major accident.


"I'd be more scared of what's going over our railroads than the nuclear 
material on our highways," he said.


In an interview with PBS's Frontline, Stallings said transporting nuclear 
waste emotionally scares people beyond belief - even in an area like 
Pocatello, which has had hundreds of its citizens work at INEEL.


"When we raised the issue that people would be carrying spent fuel through 
the railroad yards in Pocatello, or that trucks would be bringing it through 
I-15 É and does that make you nervous, the numbers just go off the scale," he 
said. "There's tremendous fear that's somehow there's going to be an accident 
and their kids are going to be affected for their life. It's unreal. It's not 
likely to happen. And yet it's hard to convince people otherwise."

Gen. Franks Doubts Constitution Will Survive WMD
Attack
  John O. Edwards, NewsMax.com
  Friday, Nov. 21, 2003
Gen. Tommy Franks says that if the United States
is hit with a weapon of mass destruction that
inflicts large casualties, the Constitution will
likely be discarded in favor of a military form of
government.
Franks, who successfully led the U.S. military
operation to liberate Iraq, expressed his worries
in an extensive interview he gave to the men's
lifestyle magazine Cigar Aficionado.

In the magazine's December edition, the former
commander of the military's Central Command warned
that if terrorists succeeded in using a weapon of
mass destruction (WMD) against the U.S. or one of
our allies, it would likely have catastrophic
consequences for our cherished republican form of
government.

Discussing the hypothetical dangers posed to the
U.S. in the wake of Sept. 11, Franks said that
"the worst thing that could happen" is if
terrorists acquire and then use a biological,
chemical or nuclear weapon that inflicts heavy
casualties.

If that happens, Franks said, "... the Western
world, the free world, loses what it cherishes
most, and that is freedom and liberty we've seen
for a couple of hundred years in this grand
experiment that we call democracy."

Franks then offered "in a practical sense" what he
thinks would happen in the aftermath of such an
attack.

"It means the potential of a weapon of mass
destruction and a terrorist, massive,
casualty-producing event somewhere in the Western
world - it may be in the United States of
America - that causes our population to question
our own Constitution and to begin to militarize
our country in order to avoid a repeat of another
mass, casualty-producing event. Which in fact,
then begins to unravel the fabric of our
Constitution. Two steps, very, very important."

Franks didn't speculate about how soon such an
event might take place.

Already, critics of the U.S. Patriot Act, rushed
through Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks, have argued that the law aims to curtail
civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent.

But Franks' scenario goes much further. He is the
first high-ranking official to openly speculate
that the Constitution could be scrapped in favor
of a military form of government.

The usually camera-shy Franks retired from U.S.
Central Command, known in Pentagon lingo as
CentCom, in August 2003, after serving nearly four
decades in the Army.

Franks earned three Purple Hearts for combat
wounds and three Bronze Stars for valor. Known as
a "soldier's general," Franks made his mark as a
top commander during the U.S.'s successful
Operation Desert Storm, which liberated Kuwait in
1991. He was in charge of CentCom when Osama bin
Laden's al-Qaeda attacked the United States on
Sept. 11.

Franks said that within hours of the attacks, he
was given orders to prepare to root out the
Taliban in Afghanistan and to capture bin Laden.

Errand Boy - God Personally 
Told Bush To Invade Iraq
By Chris Floyd
The Moscow Times.com
6-30-3

"God told me to strike at al-Qaida and I struck them, and then He instructed 
me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the 
problem in the Middle East."

MOSCOW -- SO, now we know. After all the mountains of commentary and 
speculation, all the earnest debates over motives and goals, all the detailed
analyses 
of global strategy and political ideology, it all comes to down to this: 
George W. Bush waged war on Iraq because, in his own words, God "instructed me to 
strike at Saddam."

This gospel was revealed, appropriately enough, in the Holy Land this week, 
through an unusual partnership between the fractious children of Abraham. The 
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz was given transcripts of a negotiating session 
between Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas and faction leaders from
Hamas and 
other militant groups. Abbas, who was trying to persuade the groups to call a 
cease-fire in their uprising against Israeli forces, described for them his 
recent summit with Ariel Sharon and Bush.

During the tense talks at the summit, Bush sought to underscore the kind of 
authority he could bring to efforts at achieving peace in the Middle East. 
While thundering that there could be "no deals with terror groups," Bush
sought to 
assure the rattled Palestinians that he also had the ability to wring 
concessions from Sharon. And what was the source of this wonder-working power?
It was 
not, as you might think, the ungodly size of the U.S. military or the 
gargantuan amount of money and arms the United States pours into Israel year
after 
year.

No, Bush said he derived his moral heft from the Almighty Himself. What's 
more, the Lord had proven his devotion to the Crawford Crusader by crowning his 
military efforts with success. In fact, he told Abbas, God was holding the door 
open for Middle East peace right now -- but they would have to move fast, 
because soon the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe would have to give His 
attention to something far more important: the election of His little sunbeam, 
Georgie, in 2004.

Here are Bush's exact words, quoted by Ha'aretz:

"God told me to strike at al-Qaida and I struck them, and then He instructed 
me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the 
problem in the Middle East. If you help me, I will act, and if not, the elections 
will come and I will have to focus on them."

You can't put it plainer than that. The whole chaotic rigmarole of Security 
Council votes and UN inspections and congressional approval and Colin Powell's 
whizbang Powerpoint displays of "proof" and Bush's own tearful prayers for 
"peace" -- it was all a sham, a meaningless exercise.

NO votes, no inspections, no proof or lack of proof -- in fact, no earthly 
reason whatsoever -- could have stopped Bush's aggressive war on Iraq. It was 
God's unalterable will: the Lord of Hosts gave a direct order for George W. Bush 
to "strike at Saddam."

And strike he did, with an awesome fury that rained death and destruction on 
the mustachioed whore of Babylon, with a firestorm of Godly wrath that 
consumed the enemy armies like so much chaff put to the flame -- and with an
arsenal 
of cruise missiles, cluster bombs, dive bombers and assault helicopters that 
killed up to 10,000 innocent civilians: blasted to pieces in their beds, shot 
down in their fields and streets, crushed beneath the walls of their own 
houses, boiled alive in factories, ditches and cars, gutted, mutilated, beheaded, 
murdered, women, children, elders, some praying, some wailing, some cursing, 
some mute with fear as metal death ripped their lives away and left rotting hulks 
behind. This was the work of the Lord and His faithful servant, whom He hath 
raised high up to have dominion over men.

And this is the mindset -- or rather, the primitive fever-dream -- that is 
now directing the actions of the greatest military power in the history of the 
world. There can be no doubt that Bush believes literally in the divine 
character of his mission. He honestly and sincerely believes that whatever
"decision" 
forms in his brain -- out of the flux and flow of his own emotional impulses 
and biochemical reactions, the flattery and cajolements of his sinister 
advisers, the random scraps of fact, myth and fabrication that dribble into his 
proudly undeveloped and incurious consciousness -- has been planted there, whole 
and perfected, by God Almighty.

And that's why Bush acts with such serenity and ruthlessness. Nothing he does 
can be challenged on moral grounds, however unethical or evil it might 
appear, because all of his actions are directed by God. He can twist the truth, 
oppress the poor, exalt the rich, despoil the Earth, ignore the law -- and murder 
children -- without the slightest compunction, the briefest moment of doubt or 
self-reflection, because he believes, he truly believes, that God squats in 
his brainpan and tells him what to do.

And just as God countenanced deception on the part of Abraham, just as God 
forgave David for the murders he ordered, just as God blessed the armies of Saul 
as they obliterated the Amalekites, man, woman and child, so will He overlook 
any crime committed by Bush and his minions as they carry out His will. 
That's why Bush can always "do whatever it takes" to achieve his goals. And by
his 
own words to Abbas, we see that he places his election in 2004 above all other 
concerns, even the endless bloodshed in the Middle East.

So what new crimes will the Lord have to countenance to keep His appointed 
servant in power?

  Army shells pose cancer risk in Iraq

 Depleted uranium causing high radioactivity levels

 Antony Barnett, public affairs editor Sunday December 14, 2003 The UK Observer

 &nbsp; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">http://www.guardian.co.uk</a> &nbsp; 
 <a href="http://snipurl.com/3f25">http://snipurl.com/3f25</a>

 http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,110668</a> 7,00.html

 Depleted uranium shells used by British forces in southern Iraqi battlefields
are putting civilians at risk from 'alarmingly high' levels of radioactivity.

 Experts are calling for the water and milk being used by locals in Basra to be
monitored after analysis of biological and soil samples from battle zones found
'the highest number, highest levels and highest concentrations of radioactive
source points' in the Basra suburb of Abu Khasib - the centre of the fiercest
battles between UK forces and Saddam loyalists.

 Readings taken from destroyed Iraqi tanks in Basra reveal radiation levels
2,500 times higher than normal. In the surrounding area researchers recorded
radioactivity levels 20 times higher than normal.

 Critics of these controversial munitions - used to penetrate tank armour -
believe inhaling the radioactive dust left by the highly combustible weapon
causes cancer and birth defects. It has long been alleged that depleted uranium
(DU) used in the first Gulf conflict was responsible for abnormally high levels
of childhood leukaemia and birth defects in Iraq. Depleted uranium is also
believed by some to be a contributing factor in Gulf War syndrome.

 The disclosure comes days after the charity Human Rights Watch claimed
hundreds of 'preventable' deaths of civilians have been caused by the use of
cluster bombs by US and UK forces during the conflict. The latest research,
based on a two-week field trip by scientists, was carried out by the
Canadian-based Uranium Medical Research Centre (UMRC) led by a former US
military doctor Asaf Durakovic.

 Tedd Weymann, deputy director of UMRC, said: 'At one point the readings were
so high that an alarm on one of my instruments went off telling me to get back.
Yet despite these alarmingly high levels of radiation children play on the
tanks or close by.'

 The amount of DU used during the Iraq war has not been revealed, although some
estimate it was more than a thousand tons. Last week, Labour MP Llew Smith
obtained from the Ministry of Defence a list of 51 map co-ordinates in Iraq
where sites were struck by DU weapons. France, Spain and Italy claim soldiers
who served in Bosnia and Kosovo, where DU shells were used by Nato, have
contracted cancers.

 Witnesses told the UMRC that a British Army survey team inspected Abu Khasib.
'The UK team arrived dressed in white full-body radiation suits with protective
facemasks and gloves. They were accompanied by translators who were ordered to
warn residents and local salvage crews that the tanks in the battlefield are
radioactive and must be avoided,' the report states, adding: 'The British
forces have taken no steps to post warnings, seal tanks and personnel carriers
or remove the highly radioactive assets.'

 Dr Chris Busby, who is a member of a government committee examining radia tion
risks, expressed concern. 'There is no question that inhaling this radioactive
dust can increase the risk of lymphomas,' he said.

 Professor Brian Spratt, who chaired a Royal Society working group on the
hazards of DU, said: 'British and US forces need to acknowledge that DU is a
potential hazard and make inroads into tackling it by being open about where
and how much has been deployed. Fragments of DU penetrators are potentially
hazardous, and should be removed, and areas of contamination around impact
sites identified. Impact sites in residential areas should be a particular
priority. Long-term monitoring of water and milk to detect any increase in
uranium levels should also be introduced in Iraq.'

 In a statement, the MoD said: 'The allegations made by the UMRC are not
substantiated by credible scientific evidence. They give no activity
concentrations of the material concentrations on the ground or in the air, and
their conclusions are not substantiated by readings taken by MoD's own survey
team... The MoD sent a small team of scientists to Iraq in June to perform a
preliminary survey in order to identify issues... and provide safety advice to
scientists in the field. This survey looked at a small number of locations
where tanks had been defeated by DU and found limited contamination at
localised points; the highest contamination was at the point of entry on a
defeated tank and this was fixed to the metal and could not be rubbed off on
the skin by touch, much less inhaled.

 'The UMRC appears to consider a small, highly localised area of contamination
to present a large health risk. Use of &quot;worst case&quot; data to calculate
risks to the population is inappropriate.'

State moves ahead with radioactive waste process

BC-TX--Radioactive Waste, Bjt,0530 

State moves ahead with radioactive waste process 

snglf 

By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer 

AUSTIN (AP) -- State regulators approved rules Wednesday that companies are 
to follow when they apply to run a planned low-level radioactive waste site 
in West Texas. 

"It's a big step," said Susan Jablonski of the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality. "Having the rules out there allows everybody to know 
what the rules of this commission (are) going to be." 

Lawmakers in the spring approved a bill that allows for the creation of two 
privately-run waste disposal facilities licensed by the state. 

One would handle waste under a compact between Texas, Vermont and Maine, 
although Maine has since dropped out of the compact. A separate but adjacent 
facility would take U.S. Department of Energy waste. 

The rules adopted by the TCEQ lay out what the application has to include, 
such as financial security and the technical requirements. The rules also 
list the criteria for evaluating multiple applications, Jablonski said. 

"If they are going to apply, you want them to put their best foot forward," 
Jablonski said. "We want applications that have all the information that we 
need in order to evaluate them." 

Jablonski said it will be at least the end of 2007 before a license is 
awarded. 

Rep. Lon Burnam, a Democrat from Fort Worth who fought against the bill in 
the Legislature, said the commissioners passed "pretty good rules." 

"While I think the law is a horrible anti-public interest bill that should 
have never passed in the first place, the commission has done more good than 
I thought they may have been able to pull off," Burnam said. 

He applauded the commissioners' decision that the applications be posted on 
the Internet and said the commissioners expressed a willingness to consider 
creating a citizen oversight panel, something he supports. 

Jablonski said the commissioners are open to a citizen advisory committee but 
want to talk further about how it would be constructed. She said such a 
committee did not have to be set up now. 

Michael Woodward, an attorney who represents Dallas-based Waste Control 
Specialists, said the company was excited that the rules have been adopted so 
it can move forward with the application process. He said the company will 
seek the license to operate the waste site. 

"Any facility licensed under these rules, which provide very strict criteria, 
will be protective of health and the environment," Woodward said. 

The TCEQ also approved a rule change on how it treats pollution released by a 
company either by accident, during routine maintenance or when a facility 
shuts down or starts up. Under the new rule, the emission releases either 
have to be permitted for or they would be considered a violation if the 
company couldn't prove the releases were unavoidable. 

The TCEQ was under pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency to 
change the rule.

Council concerned about waste 
Resident wants landfill policy re-examined. 
Thursday, December 18, 2003
By JEFF SCHOGOL 
The Express-Times 

PLAINFIELD TWP. -- Grand Central Sanitary Landfill accepts low-level 
radioactive waste, landfill operations manager Bruce Fahs said Wednesday. 

Fahs testified during a public hearing on Waste Management Inc.'s application 
to expand Grand Central by about 43 acres. 
   
     
Wednesday marked the ninth hearing on the matter since Sept. 11. 

Fahs said if the landfill's radiation detectors go off when a truck drives 
by, the truck is inspected. 

In some situations, Waste Management must call the state Department of 
Environmental Protection which decides if the truck can dump its load or not, 
Fahs said. 

Fahs said the DEP has allowed trucks to dump low-level radioactive waste at 
the landfill but only if it has determined the waste does not pose a health 
risk. 

Fahs noted that radiation is a naturally occurring phenomenon. One source of 
low level radioactive waste is iodine, which is used in medical procedures, 
he said. 

Another source of low-level radiation is discarded wrist watches, said Waste 
Management spokesman Harry Smith. 

Waste Management attorney Anthony Martino said the landfill accepts 
a "minuscule" amount of low-level radioactive waste. 

But Pen Argyl is concerned about the low-level radioactive waste, so much so 
that it monitors landfill leachate treated at the borough's sewage treatment 
plant for radiation, said borough Councilman David De Palma. 

Washington Township resident Sherry Darr asked why Waste Management needs 
radiation detectors to know if a truck is carrying low-level radioactive 
waste. 

Darr said Waste Management should know which trucks have low-level 
radioactive waste beforehand. Those trucks should be tested before they reach 
the landfill and clearly identified if they contain low-level radioactive 
waste, she said. 

She said she did not think any radioactive waste should be allowed in the 
landfill at all. 

She also said she is not confident in the DEP's ability to investigate 
radioactive incidents based on their poor track record investigating odor 
complaints. 

Darr said she wants to know if there are public records detailing how much 
low-level radioactive waste is being disposed of at the landfill and where it 
comes from. 

Township supervisors Chairman Randy Lieberman said he was unaware that low-
level radioactive waste was being dumped at the landfill. 

Lieberman said the board of supervisors would be concerned about the waste. 

Processed infectious waste was another topic at Wednesday's hearing. 

Martino submitted a letter from the DEP stating the landfill accepts only 
processed infectious waste. 

Supervisors were concerned when they learned in October that the landfill 
accepted processed infectious waste. But the landfill can only accept 
infectious waste that has been disinfected, according to a letter from 
William Tomayko of the DEP. 

Even so, the supervisors must determine if the township zoning ordinance 
allows the landfill to accept any infectious waste, processed or otherwise, 
said township Solicitor David Backenstoe. 

Supervisors also must determine if the zoning ordinance's provision for 
infectious waste is preempted by state regulations, Backenstoe said. 

Also Wednesday, landfill engineer Jan Hutwelker presented supervisors with 
more information about the health risk assessment commissioned by Waste 
Management. 

The health risk assessment concluded that the landfill poses no health risk 
to the public. 

Hutwelker gave supervisors information about where dust samples were taken as 
well as descriptions of weather conditions when the samples were taken. 

Pen Argyl solicitor Peter Layman noted that the data on wind direction taken 
at the landfill's meteorological station was different from data taken at 
dust sampling points. 

Hutwelker acknowledged the conflicting data and said it is difficult to 
determine the direction of the wind when it is calm. 

Layman said the disparity could mean the data is flawed or it could mean that 
wind swirls at the landfill, making it difficult to stop litter and dust from 
blowing off the site. 

The landfill expansion hearing scheduled for today was canceled because Waste 
Management did not have a witness ready, Backenstoe said.

Nuclear plant operators want extension on repair


The Associated Press

BAY CITY - Operators of a Southeast Texas nuclear plant have asked the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend until February the time it has to 
repair a failed emergency diesel generator, a spokesman for the plant said 
Wednesday.

Workers at the South Texas Project in Bay City believe a rod in one of six 
diesel generators used in emergencies was flawed and had microcracks, 
resulting in the generator's failure during a test Dec. 9, project spokesman 
Ed Conaway said.

The generators would be used if the plant's off-site power failed.

The commission has given the plant until Tuesday to make the repairs, or the 
reactor connected to the emergency generator might have to be shut down. The 
commission requires three emergency diesel generators for each nuclear 
reactor.

Conaway said workers plan to inspect rods in the other five generators as 
well.

Only one emergency generator is needed to keep each of the plant's two 
reactors operational in case of a power failure, he said

Landfill says it's not too nuclear 

"Low-level" waste not there, they say. 


Saturday, December 20, 2003


By JEFF SCHOGOL 
The Express-Times 

PLAINFIELD TWP. -- When Grand Central Sanitary Landfill Operations Manager 
Bruce Fahs said Wednesday the landfill accepts low-level radioactive waste, 
he meant "harmless" radioactive waste. 

That according to Waste Management spokesman Harry Smith who said the company 
plans to run an advertisement purchased by the landfill owner to "present 
accurate information." The ad is scheduled to run during the final week of 
this year. 

 
  From our Advertisers


   
     
The topic came up at Wednesday's expansion hearings 

Waste Management has applied to expand the landfill by about 43 acres. The 
matter is now before Plainfield Township supervisors. 

Asked Wednesday if the landfill accepts low-level radioactive waste, Fahs 
said, "Yes." 

Smith said on Friday Fahs' answer needs to be clarified. 

A draft of the advertisement provided by Smith says the landfill does not 
accept low-level radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive waste must be 
transported to South Carolina, Texas or Utah, it says. 

However, some waste disposed of at the landfill does contain harmless 
radioactive isotopes, the advertisement says. 

Some of the waste dumped at the landfill contains low-activity, harmless 
radioactive isotopes, the advertisement says. Most of the radioactivity comes 
from "life-saving medical treatments," and those radioactive isotopes lose 
their energy in a few hours or days, it says. 

Smith said statements he and Fahs made at Wednesday's landfill expansion 
hearing about low-level radioactive waste that the landfill accepts in fact 
refer to this harmless waste. 

Waste Management attorney Anthony Martino said Friday he also was referring 
to harmless waste when he said at Wednesday's hearing the landfill accepts 
a "miniscule" amount of low-level radioactive waste. 

In 2000, the state Department of Environmental Protection required landfills 
to inspect all incoming waste for radioactivity, the advertisement says. 
Trucks carrying "unacceptable waste" are rejected, the advertisement says. 

Still, Pen Argyl is concerned, said Councilman David De Palma. 

The borough monitors landfill leachate treated at its sewer plant for 
radiation, De Palma said. Pen Argyl has not detected any radiation since it 
started monitoring the leachate about a year ago, he said. 

Leachate is the liquid runoff that has percolated through the garbage in the 
landfill. 

Smith said Pen Argyl need not be concerned about radiation, but De Palma said 
the borough will continue monitoring the leachate for radiation. 

The state made the landfill install the radiation monitors for a reason, De 
Palma said. He also said the landfill accepted waste before it was mandated 
to install radiation detectors. 

Radioactivity is a naturally occurring phenomenon.

South Texas nuclear plant can run despite failure of generator
By Michael Graczyk
The Associated Press

HOUSTON - The South Texas Project nuclear plant will continue to run at full 
capacity after operators convinced government regulators that a failure in a 
backup diesel generator is an isolated problem, plant officials said Tuesday.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission had given the operators of the plant near 
Bay City, about 100 miles southwest of Houston, until Tuesday to supply 
information on whether a similar problem existed in connecting rods in five 
other generators.

Mark McBurnett, manager of nuclear safety assurance at the plant, said 
technicians developed ultrasonic inspection techniques to examine the other 
diesel engines and proved to themselves and NRC inspectors that the 20-
cylinder engines are fine.

"There was never any safety impact on the reactor unit," he said.

Federal regulators could have ordered the reactors shut down if the other 
diesel engines had problems. Department of Energy statistics list the 
reactors as the largest in the nation, with peak combined capacity of 2,529 
megawatts.

"Our first focus was to understand what the cause of that event was," 
McBurnett said. "We have five others just like it -- two in that unit and 
three in the other -- and needed to verify those engines didn't have same 
problem.

"We were able to take broken parts and look in detail at the metallurgy -- 
and the metallurgy doesn't lie -- and determine cause of the failure. ... We 
demonstrated to ourselves and the NRC that the other five engines did not 
have that problem, and on that basis they were able to approve our request to 
continue to operate the unit while we were making the repairs."

One of the six generators failed this month during a routine monthly test. 
The generators, three connected to each of the plant's two reactors, would be 
used in emergencies if the plant's off-site power failed. Only one generator 
is required for emergency backup of each unit.

"We really have backups to backups," McBurnett said.

The problem generator was connected to Unit 2 of the plant.

McBurnett said details of the repair schedule are still being worked out but 
estimated the repairs would take "the best part of the first quarter of the 
year."

"The engine has to be removed, be completely disassembled," he said. "We'll 
take each part, inspect and check it against original fabrication 
requirements, and anything that doesn't conform will need to be replaced. Our 
goal is to restore it to a better than new condition."

The plant has been providing power to more than 1 million homes in Southeast 
and South Central Texas since Unit 1 went into service in August 1988. Unit 2 
began producing power 10 months later.

Unit 1 was idled for several months this year after an inspection April 12 
detected a tiny deposit containing boric acid -- described as about half the 
size of an aspirin -- on the bottom of the containment area of the reactor 
vessel. Repairs were completed in July.

Plant managers said their investigation suggested that the leak was the 
result of a problem during original fabrication.

Kentucky misses out on new plant
By JOHN McCARTHY Associated Press writer
January 13, 2004

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio was chosen over Kentucky for a $1.5 billion plant that 
will use updated technology to enrich uranium, the company building the 
facility announced Monday. 

The facility at the shuttered Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon 
will employ 500 people and will be operating by the end of the decade, USEC 
Inc. President Nick Timbers said. 
 
The company chose its Ohio site over its Paducah, Ky., plant largely because 
existing buildings from 1980s tests of the enrichment technology would reduce 
costs, he said. 

"The Ohio proposal offered the right mix of economic benefits, existing 
infrastructure, assurances concerning seismic conditions and schedule 
advantage for this important new facility," Timbers said. 

The plants USEC currently owns in the two states have produced enriched 
uranium using the old method of gaseous diffusion. The new plant will enrich 
uranium for use in nuclear power plant reactors with centrifuge processing, a 
more efficient technology. 

In centrifuge processing, currently used in several other countries, enriched 
uranium and waste are separated in tall, spinning cylinders. The method uses 
less power needed for gaseous diffusion and produces less waste. 

The new plant is on track to produce uranium faster than any other centrifuge 
facility, the company said. When it's fully operational, the plant will 
produce enough uranium each year to fuel 30 power plants, each providing 
electricity to a city the size of Memphis, Tenn., or El Paso, Texas. 

The technology will be tested in 2005 at the Piketon facility about 40 miles 
north of the Kentucky state line.

Y-12 security review deemed 'pretty ugly' 

CONGRESSMAN: 'We have to make sure this facility, its workforce and our 
community are strongly protected.' 

By: Paul Parson | Oak Ridger Staff

Y-12 security review deemed 'pretty ugly' 

CONGRESSMAN: 'We have to make sure this facility, its workforce and our 
community are strongly protected.' 

In the event of a terrorist attack, Oak Ridge's nuclear weapons plant could 
not adequately protect its supply of bomb-grade uranium, according to a 
federal watchdog group.
The Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight based its claims 
on unnamed government sources and a review last month of protective security 
forces at the Y-12 National Security Complex. Oak Ridge was apparently the 
first site to undergo the high-level security exercise, which was conducted 
by the Department of Energy's office of Security and Performance Assurance.

"It (the review) was pretty ugly," said Peter Stockton, a senior investigator 
with the watchdog group.

Joe Davis, chief spokesman for DOE headquarters, said this morning that the Y-
12 security review was not finished and added that he wasn't sure where the 
Project On Government Oversight got its information.

"I don't know if their information is even correct," Davis said.

Bill Brumley, the Oak Ridge chief of the National Nuclear Security 
Administration, declined to discuss any details of the review during a brief 
telephone interview Thursday afternoon. However, Brumley said he recently 
discussed the review with high-ranking NNSA officials - a typical procedure 
following such inspections.

Officials with BWXT Y-12 also declined to comment on the review or the 
Project On Government Oversight's claims. BWXT Y-12 manages Y-12 for the 
NNSA - the quasi-independent agency within DOE that oversees the nuclear 
weapons complex.

Y-12, which is sometimes referred to as the "Fort Knox of Uranium," plays a 
major role in the security of the nation by its production and refurbishment 
of weapons components, storage of nuclear material and prevention of the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction.

Construction of Y-12 started in the early 1940s as part of World War II's 
Manhattan Project. The uranium enriched at Y-12 ultimately fueled the "Little 
Boy" bomb, which was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, near the end of the war in 
1945.

According to the watchdog group, most of the facilities at Y-12 that store 
highly enriched uranium are at least 50 years old, and were not designed to 
store large quantities of weapons-grade nuclear materials.

For quite some time, Y-12's storage arrangements have been considered a weak 
point in the nation's nuclear security, according to some observers. And, in 
early 2001, the Project On Government Oversight issued a report stating that 
the federal government had lax security at its nuclear weapons facilities, 
including Y-12.

If a terrorist gains access to the highly enriched uranium, he or she could 
create a so-called improvised nuclear device in a matter of minutes, 
according to Stockton. Though several varying definitions exist, an 
improvised nuclear device is essentially a weapon designed to result in the 
dispersal of radioactive material or in the formation of nuclear-yield 
reaction.

"It's not difficult," said Stockton of the construction of the improvised 
nuclear devices. However, he would not discuss how the weapons are made.

U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-3rd District, described Y-12 as the linchpin of the 
nation's nuclear weapons complex, adding that it plays a strategic role in 
the defense of the country.

"Every facet of our country's infrastructure faces dramatically increased 
security challenges in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, and our nation's 
vital nuclear weapons facilities face a dangerous new type of threat," the 
congressman said.

"I am briefed regularly and in depth by top NNSA officials as they replace 
the aging structures, invest in cutting-edge security technologies and 
increase the guard force to strengthen Y-12's security posture. We have to 
make sure this facility, its workforce and our community are strongly 
protected."

A new storage facility for highly enriched uranium is a key element in the 
modernization of the aging Oak Ridge weapons plant. In previous interviews, 
BWXT Y-12 officials have said construction on the facility would begin this 
year, with the end product being as big as "roughly four football fields."

"It's a step in the right direction," said Stockton of the proposed storage 
facility. "I don't know if that's going to solve the whole problem."

Stockton said he also had it on good authority that someone had been "taken 
out of their position" at the Oak Ridge NNSA office, possibly as a result of 
the recent review.

"No one has been demoted," said Brumley. "No one has been fired. No one has 
been canned."

However, the NNSA chief said he recently made some management changes in his 
local office to "further strengthen" the organization. Brumley told The Oak 
Ridger that Sharon Daly, who served as assistant manager of safeguards and 
security, was detailed to an assignment focusing on the technical aspects of 
security. The NNSA chief also said that Ken Ivey will assume the top security 
position on an acting basis.

Brumley also said Thursday afternoon he might bring in some people from the 
NNSA's field office in Amarillo, Texas, for some temporary assignments in Oak 
Ridge. The Amarillo office oversees the Pantex Plant.

Wackenhut Services Inc. has provided security at the Y-12 weapons plant since 
January 2000. Last September, the NNSA gave its security contractor its 
highest scores to-date on an evaluation. According to Wackenhut officials, 
the company received "outstanding" scores in several areas including 
protective force training and rapid response to changing security condition

Nukes were mishandled, board says 

By Matt Kelley
The Associated Press

WASHINGTON  Workers dismantling an aging nuclear weapon improperly secured 
broken pieces of a highly explosive component by taping them together, 
federal investigators found. An explosion could have occurred, they said. 

The incident was among several recent safety lapses at the Energy 
Department's Pantex plant near Amarillo, Texas, noted by the independent 
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. In another instance, workers taking 
apart an old warhead last fall accidentally drilled into the warhead's 
radioactive core, forcing evacuation of the facility. 

This month's unorthodox handling of the unstable explosive by taping pieces 
together increased the risk that the technicians would drop it and set off 
a "violent reaction," the safety board said Tuesday in a letter to Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham. 

Such a reaction could have "potentially unacceptable consequences," board 
chairman John Conway said in the letter, which raised disquieting questions 
about safety at the Pantex plant, located within 50 miles of about 250,000 
people. 

The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the Energy 
Department's nuclear-weapons programs, is investigating, spokesman Bryan 
Wilkes said Friday. 

Safety board chairman Conway's letter did not make clear whether the 
explosive had been separated at the time from the softball-sized chunk of 
plutonium that forms the pit, or trigger, of a thermonuclear warhead. To 
prevent a thermonuclear blast, the pit would have to have been separated from 
the larger warhead. 

If the explosive were connected to the trigger, an explosion could have 
injured or killed workers and could have spread plutonium or other 
radioactive materials around the facility. 

Conway said taping the explosives together was one of several mistakes made 
by Pantex officials that risked an explosion. Pantex officials also played 
down the risk, Conway said, calling the cracks in the explosive and the fact 
that workers taped it together a trivial change in procedures. 

Conway's letter does not elaborate on what might have happened had the 
explosive detonated. 

  Jud Simmons, a spokesman for Pantex plant operator BWX Technologies, did 
not return telephone messages. 

The Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has an inspector stationed at the Pantex 
plant. Weekly reports by the Pantex inspector, William White, show several 
problems with safety at the plant, including flaws in software designed to 
control the movement of nuclear and explosive materials. 

White reported in October that Pantex technicians had made a mistake while 
dismantling a W62 warhead from a Minuteman missile. A drill damaged part of 
the warhead's nuclear core, prompting officials to evacuate the facility 
until experts determined that no radiation had leaked, he wrote.

Nuclear plant lapses could have caused explosion, investigators say 
By MATT KELLEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON (AP) - Workers dismantling an aging nuclear weapon improperly 
secured broken pieces of a highly explosive component by taping them 
together, federal investigators found. An explosion could have occurred, they 
said.
The incident was among several recent safety lapses at the Energy 
Department's Pantex plant near Amarillo, Texas, noted by the independent 
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Last fall, workers taking apart 
another old warhead accidentally drilled into the warhead's radioactive core, 
forcing evacuation of the facility.
This month's unorthodox handling of the unstable explosive increased the risk 
that the technicians would drop it and set off a "violent reaction," the 
safety board said Tuesday in a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.

Such a reaction could have "potentially unacceptable consequences," board 
chairman John T. Conway said in the letter, which raised disquieting 
questions about safety at the Pantex plant.

About 250,000 people live within 50 miles of the Pantex plant, where the 
motto on its Web site is "Maintaining the safety, security and reliability of 
America's nuclear weapons stockpile."

Nothing exploded, and no one was hurt.

The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the Energy 
Department's nuclear weapons programs, is investigating, spokesman Bryan 
Wilkes said Friday.

"Safety remains a priority for us," Wilkes said. "We are working to address 
the issues in the letter."

Safety board chairman Conway's letter did not make clear whether the 
explosive had been separated at the time from the softball-sized chunk of 
plutonium that forms the pit, or trigger, of a thermonuclear warhead. To 
prevent a thermonuclear blast, the pit would have to have been separated from 
the larger warhead.

If the explosive were still connected to the trigger, an explosion could have 
injured or killed workers and could have spread plutonium or other 
radioactive materials around the facility.

The taping and removal of the explosive did not go as planned, and only quick 
thinking by the technicians prevented them from dropping the explosive, 
Conway wrote.

Conway said taping the explosives together was one of several mistakes made 
by Pantex officials that risked an explosion. Pantex officials also played 
down the risk, Conway said, calling the cracks in the explosive and the fact 
that workers taped it together a trivial change in procedures.

Jud Simmons, a spokesman for Pantex plant operator BWX Technologies Inc., did 
not return telephone messages on Friday.

The pit's plutonium is surrounded by an explosive shell. When the explosives 
detonate, the plutonium is compressed and causes a nuclear explosion. In a 
thermonuclear weapon, that explosion sets off an even stronger nuclear blast.

Workers dismantling the pit in question found the explosive was cracked, 
which made it more unstable and easier to detonate, Conway wrote. Their 
solution was to tape together the cracked explosives and move them to another 
location.

In his letter, Conway said other problems included:

-Failing to consult the explosives' manufacturer to determine how unstable 
the cracked explosives might be;

-Performing an incomplete and inadequate safety review before going ahead;

-Allowing workers to perform the taping and removal without practicing on a 
mock-up;

-Failing to have experts who had developed the procedure watch the taping and 
removal to try to spot any problems.

Conway's letter does not elaborate on what might have happened had the 
explosive detonated.

The Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has an inspector stationed at the Pantex 
plant and at the nation's other nuclear weapons sites. Weekly reports by the 
Pantex inspector, William White, show several problems with safety at the 
plant, including flaws in the software designed to control the movement of 
nuclear and explosive materials around the site.

White reported in October that Pantex technicians had made a mistake while

Report: Workers improperly secured broken nuclear weapon
Safety board faults lapses at Texas plant
>From David de Sola
CNN
Sunday, January 25, 2004 Posted: 9:47 AM EST (1447 GMT)

 
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Workers at a nuclear weapons plant in Texas improperly 
secured broken pieces of a highly explosive component by taping them 
together, which could have caused a "violent reaction," federal investigators 
report. 

No one was hurt, the facility was not damaged and safe control of all 
components and materials was maintained during the incident January 8, 
according to news release from the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. 

The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board investigated that incident, as 
well as several previous safety lapses at the Pantex Plant, the nation's sole 
nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility. 

The workers were taking apart an aging nuclear weapon when they taped the 
broken pieces together. 

In a separate incident in October, workers taking apart a W62 warhead 
accidentally drilled into its radioactive core. The facility was evacuated, 
and experts later found that no radiation had leaked from the warhead. 

Safety board Chairman John Conway wrote a letter to Secretary of Energy 
Spencer Abraham this week to summarize the board's findings regarding the 
January 8 incident. 

Among them were: 

 Employees did not perform an adequate safety analysis before attempting the 
procedure. 

 Employees did not consult with the manufacturers of the explosives to 
determine the potential hazards when dealing with damaged explosives. 

 Employees did not attempt the procedure in a practice run or demonstration 
before attempting it on the actual weapon. As a result, the task was not 
performed as it was intended. 

 No experts who developed the taping procedure were present to supervise and 
watch for any potential problems. 

According to Conway's letter, posted on the safety board's Web 
site, "potentially unacceptable consequences" could have ensued. The letter 
did not specify what might have happened had an explosion or detonation 
occurred. 

In a written statement, Pantex acknowledged the incident and said it has 
halted work on the weapons system. A review of the incident will address the 
issues raised by the board, and a report will be sent to the Department of 
Energy. 

The Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration and 
the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board could not be reached for comment.

Homer Simpson let loose on US nuclear weapons facility
By Lester Haines
Posted: 26/01/2004 at 17:55 GMT
The RegisterUK

Homer Simpson has apparently relinquished his post at Springfield nuclear 
plant to take up a new position with US Energy Department's Pantex plant in 
Texas. 

Our suspicions are aroused because the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety 
Board has reported that workers at the Amarillo complex nearly totalled the 
Lone Star State twice while dismantling old nuclear warheads. 

In the first incident, highly-skilled operatives inadvertently drilled into 
the warhead's core, provoking a full-scale evacuation of Pantex. They later 
made a second Chernobylesque blunder by bodging a highly-explosive warhead 
part back together with tape. 

Had they subsequently dropped the component, the likely outcome would have 
been a "violent reaction", with "potentially unacceptable consequences", as 
safety board chairman John T. Conway rather conservatively put it. 

Pantex is operated by BWX Technologies Inc. The facility's website assures 
visitors that BWXT Pantex is "Maintaining the safety, security and 
reliability of America's nuclear weapons stockpile" through "Teamwork that 
delivers... Results!". 

Presumably the ... represents the slight delay between the team dropping the 
warhead and then delivery of the Results! in the form of Texas reduced to an 
irradiated wilderness for 10,000 years. 

There is, mercifully, some hope that that Texans will not in future be 
obliged to check their steak and fries with a Geiger Counter since the 
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has an inspector permanently 
stationed at Pantex. We're certain he's ensuring they buck up their ideas; 
but if he should turn out to be Sideshow Bob, here is BWXT's cut-out-and-keep 
guide to what you should do once the sirens sound, entitled "WHAT TO DO IF 
YOU ARE ADVISED TO TAKE SHELTER" and culled from Pantex's entertaining 
Managing Emergency Events: 


WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE ADVISED TO TAKE SHELTER 

To protect yourself, you need to avoid physical contact with radioactive 
materials and avoid inhaling them: 

Stay indoors in your home, work place, or a nearby building. Once inside, do 
not leave unless you are told it is safe to go out or you are advised by your 
emergency management officials or law enforcement personnel to evacuate. 

Close all windows, doors, and fireplace dampers. This keeps outside air from 
entering your home or work place. 

Turn off any heating or cooling system that draws in air from the outside. If 
it becomes stuffy, use portable or ceiling fans to circulate the air inside. 

If you have been outside during the period just before you were warned to 
take shelter, take a shower or at least wash your face and hands with a 
washcloth using soap and tepid water. Change into clean clothes; put the 
clothing you were wearing and the washcloth into a plastic bag. 

Keep your radio on and tuned to one of the local EBS stations- KGNC-AM (710) 
or KGNC-FM (97.9). Listen for information and instructions 

Begin to assemble items you may need in case you are advised to evacuate. 

If you must go outdoors, cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth to avoid 
inhaling any radioactive materials that might be present.


Top advice. On the other hand, you could just join Homer down at Moe's, rack 
up a few beers, and wait for your skin to fall off. ®

US nukes: readers reach critical mass

Our chilling report earlier this week into safety at the US Energy 
Department's Pantex plant in Texas provoked a veritable inbox meltdown as 
some readers' ire reached critical mass. Adam Bridge writes: 

Although I'm sure it was fun to write, I was dismayed by the hyperbole 
invoked in your article "Homer Simpson let loose on US nuclear weapons 
facility". 

I'm trying to understand if you were just writing for laughs or if you were 
trying to actually be journalistic and couldn't pull it off. Maybe it was 
the "CHurnobylesque" reference that caught my eye - but the entire article 
seems disconnected with any real knowledge of things nuclear. 

In any case you have succeeded in living down to my expectations of any 
reportage about things nuclear. Incompetence and ignorance are still alive 
and an easy laugh is ever so much easier to get than facts and insight. 

True - it's just too tempting to play Weapons of Mass Destruction for laughs. 
Ben Rosengart further objects to our doomsday scenario which would see Texas 
razed to the ground: 

It is *extremely* difficult to set off a modern nuclear weapon by accident. 
The guts of these weapons are manufactured to precise specs and are very very 
picky. 

Modern nukes do contain high explosives, and if a chunk of that went off near 
a chunk of plutonium, I imagine you could have plutonium bits spread around 
in an unhealthful way. That's very different from the weapon going off as 
designed, which you seem to imply is possible. 

We're glad to hear it. Whether Pantex goes up in a mushroom cloud or not, 
would the casual visitor notice anything amiss? This correspondent - who has 
been granted the protection of anonymity for obvious reasons - thinks not: 

Most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference between Texas as it 
is and "Texas reduced to an irradiated wilderness for 10,000 years" without 
the aid of a Geiger Counter. It might even be an improvement. 

Before picking up hat and six-shooter and heading for Vulture Central, our 
Texan readers are reminded that it wasn't us who issued this outrageous 
libel. In any case, you should conserve ammunition for a possible war 
neighbouring Oklahoma, should the residents of that fine state take exception 
to this, from Andrew Mattei: 

I got a kick out of your Pantex article. I lived in Amarillo for a number of 
years, and a roommate ofmine worked at the facility (in the '50s' program - 
dismantling 1950s-era technology - scary stuff). 

You fail to mention, the escape routes for the Pantex facility, as well as 
the 'red zones', are printed on the local phone books (Pantex Emergency 
Information pages). ;) However, honestly, Amarillo doesn't have much to worry 
about. The gale force wind from the west that is pervasive in that area will 
blow any and all 'nuclear crap' over in to Oklahoma (where, myself being a 
Texan, it belongs anyway). ;) 

But what of the burning question of safety? Is the American nuclear industry 
really in the hands of Homer Simpson? Maybe not: we think he might already be 
working in Britain: 

Having previously worked in the British nuclear industry, I can safely say 
that bodging plute containers with gaffer tape, falling asleep on the job (of 
overseeing a nuclear reactor), dodging radioactive seagull sh*t and going out 
to sunbathe every time the sun shines (instead of overseeing a nuclear 
reactor, cf above) is all part of Standard Operating Procedure. 

Please don't publish this. :o) 

OK, we won't. Whatever Homer's current whereabouts, we can confirm that - 
incredibly - none other than Colonel Sanders is on the Pantex payroll. We kid 
you not, and as Chief of Security Police the Colonel is in charge of 
basically a civilian army, more military than law enforcement but with 
federal arrest authority. Lots of armored vehicle and belt-fed machineguns. 

Thanks to Colin Fenn for alerting us to this. The sobering truth about 
America's nuclear safety - that vulnerable facilities are protected by the 
man who invented chicken in a cardboard bucket - leads to us agree with 
reader Merlin who has the last word on the matter: 

Fortunately for India, the US doesn't outsource its nuclear weapons program. ®

Concerns delay pit facility decision
By Victoria Parker-Stevens/Current-Argus Staff Writer
Jan 28, 2004, 10:28 pm

CARLSBAD  The decision on whether a plutonium pit production facility might 
be sited in Carlsbad was delayed Wednesday.

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is one of five sites the federal Energy 
Department is considering for the manufacture of pits, which trigger nuclear 
weapons.

The Energy Secretary was expected to make a decision this spring.

The Energy Department announced it would delay the process after members of 
Congress expressed concerns about moving forward without more analysis.

Of particular concern was how many pits would be needed to maintain the 
countrys aging nuclear stockpile. In preliminary documents, the Energy 
Department is planning for a production capacity of anywhere from 80 to 450 
pits per year. 

We will almost certainly need a new pit facility, said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, 
D-N.M., in a press release.

But before we move ahead in this process, it is important to know what the 
demand for pits will be in the decades to come, he said. The delay  will 
give the agency time to undertake the analysis needed to adequately plan for 
the modern pit facility.

DOE spokesman Bryan Wilkes said there was no timeline for how long the 
process would be delayed.

Were working on those (concerns), and there will be further discussions, 
he said. This is just a bump on the road.

Congressional support was also at issue during the recent budget process, 
especially in the House.

For fiscal year 2004, the project received about $11 million  around half of 
what the Energy Department had desired.

The pit facility process was not delayed because of the funding, Wilkes said.

Mayor Bob Forrest said he wasnt surprised by the delay, which he thought 
might last until after this years national elections.

(DOE) want to move forward on this thing, he said. We were delayed almost 
30 years for WIPP. Weve got the patience of Job.

Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., also said he was confident the Energy Department 
would eventually proceed.

I am not troubled by this delay because DOE and the (National Nuclear 
Security Administration) both know that the United States eventually needs to 
construct a modern pit facility to maintain our nuclear stockpile, he said 
in a press release.

Words of concern about insufficient information were heard earlier from the 
state of New Mexico.

Environment Department Secretary Ron Curry has said the Energy Department 
should have released the name of a preferred site already so the public could 
adequately comment during the process.

New Mexicos entire congressional delegation has come out in favor of siting 
the facility in Carlsbad. Gov. Bill Richardson has not.

I remain committed to this project, and to promoting the Carlsbad site, 
Domenici said.

It provides a unique location where the necessary infrastructure is already 
in place, it has a proven record in handling radioactive materials, and it is 
a community that supports the presence of DOE, Bingaman said.

Other possible locations chosen for the facility are Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, the Nevada Test Site and 
the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

Nuclear Consultants Assure East Tennesseans on WMD Safety 
 
Plane with Part of Libya's Nuclear Program Arrives in East Tenn. 
 
January 28, 2004

OAK RIDGE (WATE) -- After a 55,000 pound shipment of Libya's weapons of mass 
destruction arrived at the Y-12 complex, a Knoxville nuclear expert talks to 6 
News about the security measures. 

White House officials said Tuesday the shipment will be evaluated at Y-12, 
and parts of it could be dismantled. 

The Y-12 National Security Complex is considered the Fort Knox of 
highly-enriched uranium. It's also the country's leading dis-assembly plant for nuclear 
weapon components. 

"The business of storing nuclear material started in Oak Ridge more than a 
half a century ago," Dr. Lee Dodds told 6 News Wednesday. He retired from Y-12 
and works as one of its consultants. Plus, he heads UT's nuclear engineering 
dept and specializes in nuclear safety. 

"The material that's brought over here is perfectly safe. We're just going to 
store it here, similar to what we did with the Sapphire Project a few years 
ago." 

Sapphire was a top secret project in 1994 that brought tons of weapons grade 
uranium from Kazakhstan to Y-12. 

>From what little he knows about the Libyan shipment, Dr. Dodds said the 
shipment doesn't contain fissile material. But even if it did, he said there's no 
better place for it. 

"We've been doing this for 60 years and it's been perfectly safe for 60 years 
and not a problem. They went to the area of expertise in the western world 
for highly enriched uranium and that's Y-12." 

Congressman Zach Wamp spoke about the Libyan shipment from Washington 
Wednesday. He said even with the recent criticism for lapses in Y-12 security, the 
decision is a vote of confidence. 

"It's encouraging to know we're called in again to handle the world's most 
dangerous materials to safely store them and secure them for our country and the 
free world," Wamp said. 

Eventually, the materials from Project Sapphire was transferred out of Oak 
Ridge to be used in other programs. 

The same could happen with the Libyan shipment. But while it's at Y-12, 
experts say there's no need to worry. "I've been in the warehouse where they store 
the stuff and it's perfectly safe," Dodds said. "I can tell you that from 
first hand experience." 

No state or federal agency, from the Knox County Sheriff's Office to the 
White House, would talk on the record specifically about the Libyan shipment, 
citing security issues. 

Speaking on general, non-specific terms, Elgan Ursey, with the Tennessee 
Emergency Management Agency (TEMA), said the higher the radioactivity of a 
transport, the more security requirements are involved. Those include armed escorts, 
often commercial vehicle enforcement officers or state troopers. 

All nuclear or radioactive transports termed high level are tracked by 
satellite in a nationwide system called Transcom, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

But TEMA officials at the emergency operations center in Nashville have 
access to Transcom data. If something happens to a truck transporting radioactive 
agents, monitors are made aware in real time. 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission makes many of the requirements for 
radioactive transports. From casks to carry the materials, to radiological surveys of 
the trucks, to make sure there's no radioactive leakage. 

Low level radioactivity trucks need no special accommodations, other than 
notices or signs on the truck noting that it's carrying radioactive cargo. 

The plane that transported the WMDs to East Tennessee will be serviced and 
return to Libya in February for another shipment of weapons components. For 
security reasons, officials won't say if the shipment will be brought to Y-12.

N.R.C. Orders Talks on Safety at 3 Reactors in New
Jersey
By MATTHEW L. WALD

Published: January 31, 2004


ASHINGTON, Jan. 30 - The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has told a company that runs three
nuclear reactors in southern New Jersey to
determine whether its employees are willing to
raise safety concerns or make decisions that put
safety foremost, because the commission's
interviews with current and former employees
indicate that they might not be.

     Advertisement


It ordered the company to come up with a plan
within 30 days to assess and correct the problem.

The commission sent a letter on Wednesday to the
Public Service Enterprise Group, which operates
Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek, which are adjacent,
in Lower Alloways Creek Township, giving the
company 30 days to come up with a plan to assess
and correct the problem. The letter said that "we
have not identified any serious safety
violations," but it added that commission
interviews raised questions about the plants'
"work environment." Some of the information from
the employees calls into question "the openness of
management to concerns and alternative views," the
letter said.

Disagreements between workers licensed by the
federal government to run the reactors and the
corporation's senior managers, particularly on
problems that might force a plant to shut down,
may have discouraged plant personnel from raising
concerns, the letter said.

Hubert J. Miller, the regional administrator for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's region
covering the Northeast, said in a telephone
interview that his staff had not drawn any
conclusion yet but that "we've got enough
information here that calls for the licensee to
look hard themselves at this."

"We're not saying in this case it's crossed any
significant line," he said. "We're trying not to
get to the point where it turns into a situation
that's unacceptable." He would not detail what the
disagreements were.

A. Christopher Bakken 3rd, a company senior vice
president for plant operations at Salem and Hope
Creek, said that Public Service knew that it might
have a problem in the area and had commissioned an
outside contractor six weeks ago to survey its
employees. The company brought in new managers
last year to address the issue, he said.

Pakistan Sacks 'Father' of Nuclear Program
By REUTERS

Published: January 31, 2004


Filed at 12:32 p.m. ET

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan fired top nuclear
scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan as scientific adviser
to the prime minister on Saturday amid a probe
into the sale of nuclear technology to Iran and
Libya.

Khan's sacking was announced just a few days after
the United States took possession of documents and
equipment for some of Libya's nuclear weapon and
missile programs. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in
December pledged to abandon efforts to acquire
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

     Advertisement


A government statement said Khan had ``ceased to
hold the office'' of special adviser to the prime
minister on the strategic program while a
government body in charge of Pakistan's nuclear
arsenal and chaired by President Pervez Musharraf
said it condemned ``individual acts of
indiscretions.''

Pakistani experts and Western diplomats doubt
whether top scientists could have traded secrets
abroad without the knowledge of senior military
and intelligence officials.

Khan's removal also comes amid increasing calls
from the international community for wider access
to Iran's nuclear facilities and less than a year
after the United States invaded Iraq on the
premise it had weapons of mass destruction that
posed an international threat.

Khan's fate is a sensitive issue in Pakistan,
where he is revered as the ``father'' of the
country's and the Islamic world's atomic bomb,
seen by many Pakistanis as a vital deterrent to
nuclear rival India.

ROGUE SCIENTISTS

The decision coincided with a meeting of the
National Command Authority (NCA) that controls
Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, is chaired by
Musharraf and composed of military, political and
scientific officials.

The military repeated earlier assertions from
Musharraf that rogue scientists operating without
official sanction must be blamed for any illegal
proliferation of nuclear secrets.

``The NCA...reiterated Pakistan's strong resolve
and commitment in adherence to international
agreements of non-proliferation,'' a statement
said.

``The government condemns and distances itself in
categorical terms from individual acts of
indiscretion in the past.''

Musharraf, a general who first took power in a
bloodless October 1999 coup, is a key U.S. ally in
its ``war on terror.''

He said earlier this month it appeared Pakistani
scientists had sold nuclear secrets abroad.

Musharraf has said he would deal harshly with
anyone found guilty ``because they are the enemy
of the state.'' Hours after his removal the
military said Khan's security had been enhanced.

Western diplomats have said Pakistani scientists
might also have sold nuclear technology to North
Korea, which has been in the crisis spotlight
since 2002 when U.S. officials said Pyongyang had
told them it was pursuing a secret nuclear
program. North Korea denies saying such things.

The Pakistani investigation is nearing a
conclusion. Khan, several of his colleagues and
former military officers were questioned in recent
weeks after a U.N. nuclear watchdog began looking
into links between Pakistan's nuclear program and
those of Iran and Libya.

Musharraf's critics say the military as a whole
should be held accountable, not the odd scientist
or mid-ranking officer who might have known of any
black market nuclear secrets trade.

``He (Musharraf) has omitted to note the most
critical factor...the unaccountable status of the
Pakistan army as the guardian of the nuclear
program and its overbearing control of civil
society,'' the weekly Friday Times said in an
editorial.

The military statement said that since the
formation of the NCA in February, 2000, no illegal
peddling of nuclear technology had taken place
there was ``no chance'' of future illegal trade.

But it added that Pakistan would not curtail its
nuclear weapons program as a result of the
investigation and the intense media spotlight on
such programs.

US Tries To Put

The Globe and Mail
1-31-4
 
CASPER, Wyo. (AP) -- The U.S. government is trying to bury something at its 
Teapot Dome oil field again. Not secret oil leases, as it did during an 
infamous scandal of the 1920s, but carbon dioxide - lots of it. 
  
In hopes of developing a process that could slow global warming, the Energy 
Department wants to inject the greenhouse-gas underground into depleted oil 
reservoirs after converting it into a liquid form. 
  
The Teapot Dome project, now in the planning stages, could be one of the 
world's largest test sites for the method. It would store CO2 from a natural gas 
processing plant about 500 kilometres away beneath the 40-square-kilometre oil 
field in central Wyoming. 
  
So-called carbon dioxide sequestration has been tested at smaller sites 
nationwide but never on such a large scale, said Vicki Stamp, a project manager for 
the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center, which manages Teapot Dome. 
  
Used in enhanced oil recovery for decades, pumping carbon dioxide into 
underground reservoirs is being touted by the Bush administration as one of the most 
promising ways to counter the greenhouse effect. 
  
"(Carbon dioxide) is the primary global greenhouse gas and it's growing 
rapidly," said Dag Nummedal, director of the University of Wyoming Institute for 
Energy Research. "During the last four or five years, the international 
consensus is that the most rational, economic and environmentally benign way of 
getting CO2 out of the atmosphere is to store it underground. 
  
"Right now, the best place to do this is in depleted oil and gas fields." 
  
Teapot Dome - named for a nearby rock formation - is currently in its 
preliminary engineering and testing stages. Storage could begin by 2006 and last 
seven to 10 years, although Mr. Nummedal said managers "don't really know the 
upper limit yet." 
  
When a reservoir is full, the pipeline is taken out and the hole sealed up. 
"The objective is to keep it sealed underground forever, hundreds or thousands 
of years," he said. 
  
The site is projected to store at least 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide 
a year when fully operational. It could eventually lead to large-scale testing 
in other Rocky Mountain states, the Ohio River Valley, Texas Gulf Coast, 
California and other areas, Mr. Nummedal said. 
  
"The long-term plan is to encourage the growth of a new private sector 
sequestration industry." 
  
Talk of a national CO2 testing centre started early last year, but it was not 
until managers found a source of carbon dioxide later that summer that the 
idea became a reality. 
  
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which owns an adjacent oil field, is extending its 
existing CO2 pipeline from a natural-gas processing plant in western Wyoming 
and has agreed to direct some of its 3.5 million cubic metres of CO2 to the 
test site, Mr. Nummedal said. 
  
The gas will then be put under pressure and injected as a liquid into the 
reservoirs through a pipeline. It could stay underground for a very long time, 
since the reservoirs that would store the CO2 held oil and methane gas for 
millions of years, said Susan Hovorka, a University of Texas researcher. 
  
"That's not true of other mechanisms," she said. "If you grow more (trees, 
which consume carbon dioxide) how do you assure it doesn't all go up in a forest 
fire or that another generation decides to go ahead and farm that area?" 
  
Burial can also rid the Earth of a large volume of carbon dioxide in a 
relatively short amount of time, Ms. Hovorka said. 
  
"We've got almost all the carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere coming 
from fossil fuels," she said. "There's space equivalent in acreage to put all 
that carbon dioxide back underground." 
  
If the project pans out, officials hope to capture CO2 from U.S. power 
plants, oil and gas refineries and other manufacturing facilities "because that is 
the CO2 today that is leaking into the atmosphere without any controls on it," 
Mr. Nummedal said. 
  
One possibility is capturing the gas with scrubbers similar to those attached 
to smokestacks that remove nitrous oxide and other gases, he said. 
  
The storage process - particularly compressing the CO2 - is expensive. Some 
estimates put it as high as $100 a tonne, though Mr. Nummedal and others said 
they do not have cost estimates for Teapot Dome. 
  
Even if it is a success, the Teapot Dome project could have little impact by 
itself. 
  
"Globally we are releasing seven billion tonnes of carbon per year," Mr. 
Nummedal said. "The amount we will be putting away here will be in the hundreds of 
thousands of tons." 
  
But he added: "If we look at all the suitable, depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs in the world, and we were able to fill all of them up, we would be able to 
store the total global emissions over the next 100 years." 
  
Some environmentalists worry about gas bubbling through cracks in the Earth 
or leaking into aquifers that supply drinking water. 
  
"We very clearly need some field demonstrations of a storage system to make 
sure (we) don't have any surprises," said David Hawkins, director of the 
Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center in Washington, D.C. 
  
Mr. Nummedal and others stress that they are testing Teapot Dome reservoirs 
for those concerns. 
  
"The early steps of this co-operative venture show the classic markings of a 
win-win proposition for American consumers," Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham 
said.

Uut and Uup Add Their Atomic Mass to Periodic
Table
By JAMES GLANZ

Published: February 1, 2004


A team of Russian and American scientists are
reporting today that they have created two new
chemical elements, called superheavies because of
their enormous atomic mass. The discoveries fill a
gap at the furthest edge of the periodic table and
hint strongly at a weird landscape of undiscovered
elements beyond.

The team, made up of scientists from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California and
the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna,
Russia, is disclosing its findings in a paper
being published today in Physical Review C, a
leading chemistry journal. The paper was reviewed
by scientific peers outside the research group
before publication.

"Two new elements have been produced," said Dr.
Walt Loveland, a nuclear chemist at Oregon State
University who is familiar with the research.
"It's just incredibly exciting. It seems to open
up the possibility of synthesizing more elements
beyond this."

The periodic table is the oddly shaped
checkerboard - with an H for hydrogen, the
lightest element, in the upper-left-hand corner -
that hangs in chemistry classrooms the world over.
Each element has a different number of protons,
particles with a positive electrical charge, in
the dense central kernel called the nucleus.

The number of protons, beginning with one for
hydrogen, fixes an element's place in the periodic
table and does much to determine an element's
chemical properties: ductile and metallic at room
temperature for gold (No. 79), gaseous and largely
inert for neon (10), liquid and toxic for mercury
(80).

Elements as heavy as uranium, No. 92 on the list,
are found in nature, and others have been created
artificially. But much heavier elements have been
difficult to make, partly because they became
increasingly unstable and short-lived.

Still, for roughly half a century, nuclear
scientists have been searching for an elusive
"island of stability," somewhere among the
superheavies, in which long-lived elements with
new chemical properties might exist. Dr. Loveland
said that the new results indicated that
scientists might be closing in on that island.

"We're sort of in the shoals of the island of
stability," said Dr. Kenton J. Moody, a Livermore
nuclear physicist who was one of the experimenters
in the work.

"It's an amazing effect," he added. "We're really
just chipping away at the edges of it."

The experiments took place at a cyclotron, a
circular particle accelerator, in Dubna, where the
scientists fired a rare isotope of calcium at
americium, an element used in applications as
varied as nuclear weapons research and household
smoke detectors. Four times during a month of
24-hour-a-day bombardment in July and August,
scientists on the experiment said, a calcium
nucleus fused with an americium nucleus and
created a new element.

Each calcium nucleus contains 20 protons and
americium 95. Since the number of protons
determines where an element goes in the periodic
table, simple addition shows the new element to
bear the atomic number 115, which had never been
seen before. Within a fraction of a second, the
four atoms of Element 115 decayed radioactively to
an element with 113 protons. That element had
never been seen, either. The atoms of 113 lasted
for as long as 1.2 seconds before decaying
radioactively to known elements.

Scientists generally do not give permanent names
to elements and write them into textbooks until
the discoveries have been confirmed by another
laboratory. By an international convention based
on the numbers, element 113 will be given the
temporary name Ununtrium (abbreviated Uut for the
periodic table) and element 115 will be designated
Ununpentium (Uup).

Dr. Loveland said he agreed that the new elements
would require independent confirmation before they
could receive final acceptance. And he conceded
that the Dubna find was likely to receive more
than the usual amount of scrutiny: two years ago,
the reported discovery of Element 118 was
retracted after a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory was found to have fabricated
evidence.




The only other truly simultaneous discovery of two
elements in recent times came in 1952, when
einsteinium (99) and fermium (100) were discovered
in the fallout from the hydrogen bomb explosion at
Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The most
recent successful discovery of an element - one
that has received a name - came in 1994. That
element, No. 110, is called Darmstadtium for the
city in Germany where it was discovered.

But as scientists wait for confirmation on
elements 115 and 113, the data presented by the
Dubna and Livermore groups appear solid, said Dr.
Sigurd Hofmann, a nuclear physicist at the
Institute for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, the
laboratory where Darmstadtium was found.

"These Dubna data look quite convincing," Dr.
Hofmann said. "And I'm sure with some more
experiments, it will finally be accepted."

Dr. Joshua B. Patin, a 28-year-old nuclear chemist
who is the lead American author on the paper, said
he had found it deeply moving to add two more
entries to a scientific icon that dates to the
1860's. That was when the Russian chemist Dmitri
Ivanovich Mendeleyev noted clear patterns in the
chemical properties of the known elements and
arranged them into the periodic table, leaving
gaps for other elements that he correctly
predicted would someday turn up.

"This is a working piece of art," Dr. Patin said.
"We're not done yet. Nothing's been finished. What
it could really mean down the road, nobody can
tell. And that's the part that's exciting to me."

The lead authorship on the work went to Dr. Yuri
Oganessian, scientific director of the Flerov
Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, whose
theoretical research in the 1970's revealed the
path that eventually led to the most recent
discoveries.

The experimental group that Dr. Oganessian leads
is especially skilled at using extremely small
amounts of the rare calcium isotope in the
bombardment and at filtering out signals from just
a handful of new atoms among the debris spewing
from the collisions.

"These elemental discoveries underscore both the
value of federally supported basic research and
the benefit of unfettered international scientific
collaboration," said Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham, whose agency helped finance the work.

In a written response to questions, Dr. Oganessian
said the results "favor the conclusion about the
formation of a new element and refute any other
interpretation." He added that confirmation of the
work was necessary, but that everything had been
done to ensure that the analysis was correct.

"In order to exclude the human factor," Dr.
Oganessian said, "the analysis of the data is
carried out in parallel and independently by the
two groups in Dubna and in Livermore."

Physicists long ago discovered that atomic nuclei
have what came to be known as "magic numbers."
Nuclei that contain just those numbers of protons
and their electrically neutral cousins, neutrons,
are especially stable. The numbers 2, 8, 20, 28,
50, 82 are magic for both protons and neutrons.

Theoretically, those numbers come about because
nuclei have a shell-like structure, said Dr.
Witold Nazarewicz, a nuclear theorist at the
University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Each shell can hold particular numbers
of protons and neutrons, and a nucleus is most
stable when its shells are precisely filled up,
leading to the magic numbers.

The highest known magic number for neutrons is
126, meaning that common lead, with 82 protons and
126 neutrons in its nucleus is the heaviest known
"doubly magic," or extremely stable, isotope in
the periodic table.

"The question is, what is the next doubly magic
nucleus beyond lead?" Dr. Nazarewicz said.

Those numbers should help map out what Dr.
Nazarewicz prefers to call generically a "region
of stability" among the superheavies. (Because, he
says, it could resemble a peninsula more than an
island.) Various theories have suggested that the
next magic proton number is 114, 120 or 126, he
said. There is general agreement that the next
magic neutron number is 184, he said.

The new experiments by the Livermore and Dubna
scientists created forms of element 115, for
example, with at most 173 neutrons, suggesting
that they are still short of what could be a land
of strange new forms of matter.

Rather than being round, nuclei in that region and
beyond could contain bubbles and have strange
doughnut-like shapes, Dr. Nazarewicz said.

They could also have unpredictable chemical
properties.

The new work should shed light on whether theories
of those undiscovered bits of matter are correct
or not, he said.

"Those discoveries tell us a great deal about the
underlying nuclear structure," Dr. Nazarewicz
said. "About how the very heaviest systems are
built - how they tick."

Dr. Darleane C. Hoffman, a nuclear chemist at the
University of California, Berkeley, also cautioned
that the new findings would have to be checked out
by other laboratories. But she said the value of
the work was unquestioned.

"Scientifically, just for the pure science of it,
wouldn't you like to know just how many chemical
elements there are?" Dr. Hoffman said. "And until
you actually have a measurement that you believe
and you can confirm, you don't have any idea
whether the various models the theorists propose
have any meaning at all."

 TEXAS AGREEMENT STATE REPORT INVOLVING FIRE WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL

 "On December 10, 2003, [the licensee's RSO at] Waste Control
 Specialist reported a fire involving radioactive material that
 occurred on December 9, 2003. There was no excessive exposure to
 individuals nor was there any off-site airborne release.

 "The waste processing company believes reactive metals (lithium,
 sodium, potassium) oxidized in water to start the fire. Packing
 materials were placed in a shredder that feeds into a hopper
 containing mixed waste. The system is closed with HEPA filters in
 place. Vibrations from the hopper may have resulted in the ignition.
 The material burned for about 20 seconds and was extinguished. When
 more materials were poured into a mix pan, the fire reignited and
 again was quickly extinguished.

 "According to the Licensee's preliminary calculations, the affected or
 burned radioactive material exceeded the reportable quantity of five
 times an ALI [annual limit on intake]. The total radioactive material
 in the mix pan was under 50 microcuries. The shredder contained about
 2.4 microcuries. There were 12 to 14 radionuclides involved. The
 Licensee will send a detailed written report within 30 days to include
 specifics on radionuclides and activities.

 "The most serious consequence was the unplanned fire. The building is
 pressurized and the smoke from the fire was pulled through HEPA
 filters and a monitored exhaust system. The workers wear PPE [personal
 protective equipment) and airlines with protection factors of 1000."

 Texas Incident # I-8024.

 * * * * UPDATE ON 1/21/4 AT 1651 EST TO M. RIPLEY FROM HELEN WATKINS
VIA FACSIMILE * * * *

 The following information was provided in a letter dated 1/6/2004 from
 Waste Control Specialists (WCS) to the Texas Department of Health:

 "On December 9, 2003 at approximately 1400 hrs a small fire occurred
 in the Permacon building at our facility located 30 miles West of
 Andrews, Texas. This fire occurred in the hopper beneath the waste
 shredder. There was a small quantity of untreated water reactive
 radioactive waste (WP-019224) that caught fire after passing through
 the shredder above. Two employees at the scene quickly extinguished
 the fire within the hopper using hand-held halon fire extinguishers.
 The hopper was pulled from underneath the shredder and then the waste
 was put into the mix pan where it re-ignited. It was extinguished by
 dropping water on the materials using the prentice arm.

 "The personnel who were in the immediate area were wearing
 anti-contamination clothing and respiratory protection equipment in
 accordance with the Radiation Work Permit. The air sample that was
 being collected at the time of the incident indicated approximately
 85% of the DAC for Th-228. The respiratory protection equipment used
 has a protection factor of 1000. There was no significant internal or
 external radiological exposure to personnel."

 "The radioactive distribution of the material involved is enclosed."

 Additionally, the licensee provided the following information to the
 State in response to a question about any action the licensee may have
 taken to prevent a reoccurrence of a fire. The licensee stated the
 following in an email to the State:

 "WCS issued a Stop Work Order on December 9, 2003. The Stop Order
 included a corrective action of 'Evaluate the treatment methodology
 for reactive metals prior to receipt of new shipments of reactive
 metals for processing.' WCS will not receive any new shipments of
 reactive metals for processing until such time that a different
 treatment methodology is developed to process these wastes without
 subsequent ignition of waste materials."

Tell the NRC to Retract Proposal to Weaken "EJ" Policy!

Yielding to pressure from the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the
nuclear industry's lobbying arm, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) has announced a revised policy for evaluating matters of
"environmental justice" (EJ) in licensing and other regulatory actions.
The proposed revisions would severely hinder interveners' ability to
cite disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental
effects on low-income or minority populations as legal grounds for
opposing NRC licenses or regulations.

Tell the NRC to retract this regressive policy change!  Submit prepared
comments via Public Citizen's Web site here (the deadline is tomorrow,
Feb. 4):

statement:
http://snipurl.com/495q

The policy change, which is open for public comment until February 4,
comes in response to a scathing letter from the NEI condemning the
agency for its treatment of EJ in its licensing actions.  In the letter,
the NEI asserts that the NRC has misinterpreted the 1994 executive order
that charged government agencies with achieving environmental justice as
part of their respective missions.  The NEI further demands that the NRC
establish a clear articulation of its EJ policy such that its legal
weight would be diminished.  Finally, the powerful industry lobby
recommends, rather brazenly, that "any contentions related to
environmental justice currently being adjudicated should be dismissed,
and no contentions related to environmental justice should be admitted
in any future licensing proceedings."

NEI represents the members of Louisiana Energy Services (LES) and
Private Fuel Storage (PFS), two industry consortiums whose license
applications have been stalled or denied because of EJ contentions.  LES
is seeking a license for a uranium enrichment facility, and PFS is
seeking a license for a high-level nuclear waste storage facility.  NEI
also represents large nuclear-owning utility companies Exelon Generation
Company, Entergy Corporation, and Dominion Generation, each of which
seeks an "Early Site Permit" (ESP) for a proposed new nuclear reactor.
These companies do not want to have their licenses delayed or denied
because of environmental justice interventions, regardless of their
validity.

The NRC is accepting comments on its EJ policy through Feb. 4, 2004,
per a notice in the Dec. 12 issue of the Federal Register, which
extended the comment period by 30 days from its original deadline of
Jan. 5, as noted in the Nov. 5 Federal Register.  Comments may be

Bush's Proposal to Inflate Yucca Mountain Budget Is Irresponsible

Congress Should Not Boost Budget for Nuclear Waste Dump While Legal
Challenges and Key Safety Issues Remain Unresolved

WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Bush's proposal to boost the budget for
the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump to $880 million and change how the
project is funded is irresponsible given the pending legal challenges
against the project and unresolved questions about the site's safety,
Public Citizen said today.

In the 2005 budget released today, Bush allocated much of the
additional funding -- a 30 percent increase from 2004 -- to develop and
operate the transportation system for shipments to Yucca Mountain. The
budget calls for the purchase of truck and rail casks and other
equipment for waste shipments in 2010.

"The idea of buying equipment for transporting waste to Yucca Mountain
before questions about the safety of the site are resolved, and before
the routes and mode of transport are even determined, is ludicrous,"
said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
and Environment Program. "The Department of Energy (DOE) is obviously
trying to sink so much money into this hole in the ground that the
project becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."

One of the most alarming proposals in the administration's Yucca
Mountain budget is the elimination of congressional oversight of much of
the project's funding. Since 1982, nuclear power utility consumers have
paid fees to the Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for the establishment of a
national repository for high-level nuclear waste.  Bush proposes that
these fees be paid directly to the DOE, thereby cutting Congress out of
decisions regarding how the fees are used.

"This is just a budgeting gimmick that artificially reduces federal
spending and hides the real costs to consumers and taxpayers," said
Hauter.

Contained in the budget was the DOE's annual programmatic assessment of
the Yucca Mountain project. The agency rated the project "adequate"
despite the many fundamental questions that remain unresolved regarding
the suitability of the site to safely and permanently isolate high-level
radioactive waste.  Not only is the site located over a drinking water
aquifer, but it is in an earthquake zone.

The DOE has been working since September 2001 to answer 293 scientific
questions, or key technical issues, that revolve around Yucca Mountain's
ability to keep radiation from contaminating the surrounding
environment. So far, answers to 83 questions have been completed and
accepted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  In a December
2003 letter, the NRC informed the DOE that it could not evaluate the
answers that the DOE had submitted because the DOE had not supplied all
the necessary technical documents.

"Due to the doubts and uncertainties plaguing the Yucca Mountain
project, Congress should not increase its budget or change the funding
practices," said Hauter. "It appears that the Bush administration is
steamrolling scientific concerns to ram this project through."

Recent developments point to the need to rein in funding for the
project. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is
deciding a slate of lawsuits against the project. One key case against
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) charges that the EPA's
standards setting the amount of radiation that can be released are not
consistent with recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS), as Congress directed in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. The EPA rule
arbitrarily limits the period for which Yucca Mountain must comply with
radiation release rules at 10,000 years, even though the NAS has found
that the maximum doses from the dump are likely to occur for 300,000
years.

The DOE intends to submit its license application for the high-level
waste dump to the NRC at the end of 2004.  The court's decisions on
these cases, which are expected this spring, could force a significant
reassessment of Yucca Mountain that would necessarily take years and
perhaps even permanently derail the project.

Pakistani Finger-Pointing and Denials Spread in
the Furor Over Nuclear Transfers Abroad
By DAVID ROHDE

Published: February 4, 2004


SLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 3 - The debate over who
bears responsibility for the transfer of
Pakistan's nuclear technology to other countries
intensified Tuesday, with surrogates for the
country's leading nuclear scientist and President
Pervez Musharraf denying charges of impropriety.

The scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, the founder of
Pakistan's nuclear program, denied telling a
government inquiry that he had given nuclear
technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya without
government permission, a leading politician said
Tuesday.

At the same time, Pakistani media accounts, citing
both a senior investigator and a friend of the
scientist, asserted that Dr. Khan had told
investigators that General Musharraf had known
that the nuclear technology was going to North
Korea.

Government officials vehemently denied that the
general had known about or approved of any
transfer of technology to North Korea or any other
country. "That's not true," said a senior official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Of course
not. Of course not."

In a series of disclosures in the past two weeks,
Pakistani government and intelligence officials,
speaking anonymously, have issued to the media
various accounts assailing Dr. Khan as a corrupt
rogue scientist who used German, Dutch and Sri
Lankan middlemen to sell or share nuclear
technology with Iran, North Korea and Libya from
1989 to 2000.

Dr. Khan and his allies, including secular and
Islamist political parties, have responded with
allegations that the country's powerful army
approved of the transfers. Their latest statement,
first reported in The Washington Post on Tuesday,
included the assertion, reputedly from Dr. Khan,
that General Musharraf knew of nuclear transfers
to North Korea.

The Post also reported that a senior investigator
and a friend of Dr. Khan said the scientist had
told investigators that Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, the
army chief from 1988 to 1991, had known that Dr.
Khan was assisting the Pakistani nuclear
transfers. The account said the scientist had also
told investigators that General Musharraf and Gen.
Jehangir Karamat, the army chief from 1996 to
1998, had known of and approved the barter of
nuclear technology for North Korean ballistic
missile technology.

In interviews, General Beg has repeatedly denied
ever approving nuclear transfers to Iran. General
Karamat declined Tuesday to comment on the report.
In an interview in November, he said no transfers
had occurred.

American officials have said they believe that
Pakistani nuclear technology has been transferred
to Iran, Libya and North Korea. They have said
Pakistani technology arrived in North Korea as
late as mid-2002, and in Libya as late as last
fall.

General Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1999, meaning that the reported transfers
occurred at least four years into his rule.
Pakistani officials have dismissed the American
accounts of recent transfers and said tight
controls the general placed on the nuclear program
in early 2002 halted Dr. Khan's transfers.

Any revelation that General Musharraf supported
transfers would put both American and Pakistani
officials in a politically awkward and dangerous
position. Since he reversed Pakistan's support for
the Taliban after the September 2001 terrorist
attacks in the United States, the general has been
hailed by the Bush administration as a firm ally
in the campaign against terrorism.

But critics in Congress have said the general is
not doing enough to crack down on militancy in
Pakistan and restore full democracy in the
country. Links to nuclear transfers could only
intensify that criticism.

'Islamic Bomb' Chief Linked to Eunice
By Ben Neary
Santa Fe New Mexican
February 29, 2004

The recent confession by Pakistan's foremost
scientist that he covertly sold nuclear-weapons
materials and technology to rogue nations North
Korea, Iran and Libya has sent shockwaves through
U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies. The
repercussions can be felt all the way to Lea
County, N.M.

In Pakistan, scientist A.Q. Khan is widely
regarded as a national hero for developing and
testing that country's first atomic bomb in 1998.
Pakistanis proudly believe Khan's claims that he
invented the bomb technology on his own. But
Western intelligence agencies have long suspected
Khan stole the critical uranium-enrichment
technology from a European company called Urenco
when he worked there in the 1970s.

Urenco is the majority owner of Louisiana Energy
Services, the company now pushing to open a
uranium-enrichment plant near the little town of
Eunice, N.M. The billion-dollar plant would
produce fuel for commercial nuclear reactors.

This month, following a long-running intelligence
probe by the CIA and other agencies, Khan admitted
he had provided nuclear-weapons expertise and
materials to Libya, North Korea and other nations
for his own profit.

In a televised address this month, Khan offered
his "deepest regrets and unqualified apologies,"
the BBC reported. "I take full responsibility for
my actions and seek your pardon," he said.

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf instantly
pardoned Khan and announced that his nation will
not allow Western intelligence agencies to inspect
records at Pakistani labs to try to gauge the
extent of Khan's activities.

Even though Khan said he ran his own nuclear black
market without Pakistani government sanction,
apparently few in the international intelligence
community believe him. Intelligence officials tell
the world press it's impossible that Khan moved
uranium-enrichment machines to other countries
without the Musharraf regime having full
knowledge.

In any case, the Pakistani proliferation case has
dire implications given the interest among
terrorist groups in obtaining nuclear weapons.

In a speech on Feb. 11, President Bush lauded the
American and British intelligence officers who
pieced together information about Khan.

"Breaking this network is one major success in a
broad-based effort to stop the spread of terrible
weapons," Bush said of Khan's operation. The
president stopped short of criticizing the
Pakistani government, presumably in recognition of
its importance in ongoing U.S. military operations
in the region.

Nonetheless, U.S. and other Western intelligence
agencies are scrambling to determine the extent of
the nuclear proliferation Khan caused.

"We don't still know the full scale of the
activity," British Foreign Minister Jack Straw
told the Reuters news agency this month. "(But)
what we had here was somebody who had made a bomb,
an operational bomb, who knew all the technology
and who was selling this on the black market
basically to anybody who could pay his price, and
we know he had sold technology to Libya and other
countries."

Meanwhile, Urenco is the biggest player in a
consortium of mostly European companies that owns
Louisiana Energy Services. That company recently
applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a
permit to open the uranium-enrichment plant in New
Mexico.

The Louisiana Energy Services project calls for
using basically the same sort of Urenco uranium
centrifuge technology in the Lea County plant as
Khan sold on the

nuclear black market. Late last year, Urenco
issued a statement denying a link between the
company and uranium-enrichment technology that
United Nations inspectors had found in Iran.

But this month Louisiana Energy Services issued a
statement reading in part, "It is likely, however,
that Dr. Khan did, in fact, steal what is now
obsolete but still workable uranium-enrichment
technology from Urenco in the 1970s and took it to
Pakistan. ... Some reports have suggested that
Iran obtained information from Pakistan."

Marshall Cohen, vice president of Louisiana Energy
Services, said Friday that Khan's presumed theft
at Urenco occurred nearly 25 years ago and only
after Dutch security officials cleared Khan to
work at the uranium facility.

"So he was fully cleared ... and was doing some
work involving centrifuge technology," Cohen said
of Khan. "And he went on a holiday to Pakistan and
never came back. And the next thing you know, it
comes out that he's putting together a Pakistani
(nuclear-weapons) program. Since that time in the
1970s, there's never been another incident where
anyone has been able to do that. Urenco has
changed its policies since that."

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as part of
its review of the Louisiana Energy Services
application, will look carefully at security
measures proposed for the New Mexico plant, Cohen
said. The company is confident no one will walk
out of the Eunice plant with information that
could be used to develop weapons, he said.

"Obviously, it's a most unfortunate thing," Cohen
said. "We're as distressed by the proliferation
business that Mr. Khan went into as anybody."

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission plans to meet in
Eunice this week to get public comment about what
the agency should consider in its environmental
impact statement for the proposed uranium plant.

Tim Johnson, project manager for the NRC in
Maryland, said last week that his agency's review
will focus on the Urenco technology and the
reliability of the equipment -- but not on the
company's central role in nuclear proliferation.

"The problems with Pakistan and other countries,
I'm not sure they're directly applicable," Johnson
said of his agency's review. "LES has to meet our
requirements for securing classified information,
the same way any Department of Defense or
Department of Energy or NRC entity that deals with
classified information has to protect it."

Don Hancock, with the Southwest Center for
Research and Information, has monitored Louisiana
Energy Services' plans in the state. New Mexicans
should be concerned about Urenco's international
security record, he said.

"Just like Urenco didn't do a good job of holding
onto some of its secrets with Khan some years ago,
it raises the question of who's going to be
looking at this plant (in New Mexico)," Hancock
said.

Meanwhile, Hancock said, if the Louisiana Energy
Services plant is licensed here, it will be
impossible for the public to track how well the
security procedures are followed because that
portion of the company's application is
classified.

Although the NRC hasn't begun its environmental
and permitting reviews of Louisiana Energy
Services' application, New Mexico's congressional
delegation and Gov. Bill Richardson have already
expressed their approval of the project. The Lea
County Commission last year approved an
industrial-bond issue of more than $1 billion to
help with plant construction.

Richardson this month said he was considering
withdrawing his support for the project because of
his concern that waste from the plant might remain
in New Mexico. But a spokesman now says the
governor is happier with the project.

The uranium-enrichment process produces a
radioactive waste called "tails." No plant
operating in the United States can "deconvert"
such tails into a stable form that can be disposed
of safely.

Although Louisiana Energy Services officials have
promised Richardson that no waste will remain in
the state, a provision in the pending Senate
energy bill written by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
would allow private uranium-enrichment plants to
turn their waste over to the U.S. Department of
Energy.

Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee
and a longtime proponent of nuclear energy, has
backed the Louisiana Energy Services project. He
invited company officials to move their operations
to New Mexico after public opposition blocked the
company's earlier plans to open plants first in
Louisiana and then in Tennessee.

Alex Flint, Domenici's top energy aide, oversaw
insertion of language to help Louisiana Energy
Services in last year's energy bill, The Wall
Street Journal reported in December. In 2001,
Flint had worked as a lobbyist for the energy
company Excelon, one of Louisiana Energy Services'
limited partners on the New Mexico project, the
newspaper reported.

The energy bill Domenici has proposed this year
contains the same language as last year's bill
allowing Louisiana Energy Services to turn over
waste to the federal government and force federal
regulators to process the company's application
quickly.

Richardson has said his support for the project
hinges on Domenici including language in an
appropriations bill in Congress to specify that
the DOE may not keep any radioactive waste from
the plant in New Mexico.

Pahl Shipley, spokesman for Richardson, said this
week that the governor has spoken with Domenici
and "the senator reassured the governor that he
would be going ahead with legislative language
that would prohibit long-term storage of LES waste
in New Mexico. And that's certainly a constructive
step in the right direction."

Cohen said the company's first choice for
disposing of the radioactive waste from its plant
would be to find a commercial company willing to
open a waste-deconversion plant in the United
States. Although Louisiana Energy Services has
said that French energy giant Cogema has expressed
interest in opening such a plant, none is
operating and there are no license applications
pending with the NRC to do so.

The federal government intends to open
deconversion plants to handle stockpiled waste
from uranium-enrichment plants it operated in Ohio
and Tennessee.

There are some 700,000 tons of such waste in those
states awaiting treatment. Ohio Gov. Bob Taft
recently wrote to the NRC saying Ohio doesn't want
any waste from the planned plant in New Mexico to
be shipped to Ohio for disposal.

Domenici's office recently said it questions
Taft's authority on the matter.

Domenici's pending energy bill would give the NRC
24 months to review and act on Louisiana Energy
Services' application.

In response to the company's permit application,
the NRC said it needs 30 months to review the
application.

Asked what the NRC will do if Congress passes
Domenici's energy bill, NRC project manager
Johnson said, "We'd do our best to try to do
what's in the law. And we would have to reprogram
things in order to do that."

   Nuclear Testing

January 30, 2004 Episode no. 722
(PBS)

http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week722/cover.html

BOB ABERNETHY, anchor: We have a special report today on the debate
over new atomic testing. The administration has proposed that testing
resume in Nevada -- underground -- to develop so-called bunker busters:
nuclear weapons that could destroy whatever was hidden deep in the
ground. The proposal has raised many questions, military, political,
and moral, about whether resumed testing would advance national
security and, if it would, how to balance that against the fears of
people who live downwind from the test site. Lucky Severson reports.

LUCKY SEVERSON: For 47 years, until the first President Bush signed a
moratorium in 1992, the U.S. government tested nearly 2,200 atomic
devices, an average of one every eight days. Over 500 were open-air
tests, many in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. Now the
administration of President George W. Bush has asked Congress for
funding to study and develop new types of nuclear weapons, and to
prepare the old Nevada site to resume testing on short notice.

(To Baker Spring, Heritage Foundation): Would you sleep better knowing
that we were resuming nuclear testing?

BAKER SPRING (Arms Control Expert, Heritage Foundation): Absolutely.
Absolutely.

SEVERSON: Baker Spring is an arms control expert with the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank. He says the Bush
administration's rationale to upgrade its aging nuclear arsenal and
develop new, smaller weapons makes sense.

Mr. SPRING: It is based on, in my judgment, the correct perception that
we're in a completely different strategic environment than we were in
the Cold War. As a result, we may need different tools to maintain
deterrence in a post-Cold War world.

SEVERSON: It's the so-called rogue nations like North Korea and Iran
that worry the administration, particularly their deep bunkers that may
be hiding weapons of mass destruction. So the Pentagon wants to develop
low-yield bombs that can destroy those bunkers. Critics say it's a
dangerous policy because it proposes using battlefield nuclear weapons
to destroy even non-nuclear targets like chemical and biological weapon
stockpiles. Daryl Kimball is with the Arms Control Association.

DARYL KIMBALL (Executive Director, Arms Control Association): I think
it's a very dangerous notion to suggest that nuclear weapons should be
viewed as just another weapon in our arsenal. By any standard, these
are, no matter who has them, weapons of mass terror and destruction. So
the U.S. should not try to expand the role of nuclear weapons from
deterring nuclear threats to deterring chemical and biological threats.

Mr. SPRING: Nuclear weapons are inanimate objects. They don't have any
moral content. It is the purposes for which they are used that have
moral content. I think that is what we have to focus on.

SEVERSON: One of the biggest concerns among critics is that it will
provoke a new nuclear arms race.

Mr. SPRING: I disagree fundamentally. I think on balance, the U.S.
nuclear deterrent is actually having the effect of dampening down the
appetite for nuclear weapons and in the context of adversaries, like
North Korea, who, I think, if they saw the U.S. was really traveling
down the path of unilateral nuclear abolition, would actually increase
the appetite for nuclear weapons.

Mr. KIMBALL: The fact that the U.S. has nuclear weapons that can
destroy Teheran and Pyongyang has not deterred either state from
pursing nuclear weapons so far. The fact that the U.S. is developing
new kinds of nuclear weapons to strike leadership targets in those
countries is making the leaders in those states even more committed to
developing the kinds of deterrent capabilities that can stop a U.S.
attack.

SEVERSON: After an extended debate on Capitol Hill, Congress, in
November, voted to approve even more funding than the administration
requested. The debate was intense, but it was little noticed outside of
Washington, except in communities near the Nevada test site.

Like St. George, Utah, where there are a large number of people who are
extremely upset about the prospect of new testing. Michelle Thomas, for
instance.

MICHELLE THOMAS (St. George Resident): You can't say to the world that
"We're not going to allow you to have these kinds of weapons, you don't
know how to handle them," and turn around and do it yourself -- that's
hypocrisy in its highest form.

SEVERSON: Michelle Thomas and thousands like her call themselves
"downwinders" -- downwind from the test site. Mary Dixon, an executive
at Salt Lake public television station KUED, is a downwinder. She's
unalterably opposed to more testing.

MARY DIXON (Creative Director, KUED-TV): I think to do that again, to
me, that's immoral. Why? Because you do not put your own people at
risk. You just do not do that. This government's job is to safeguard
its citizens. That's not protecting us. That is putting us at risk.

SEVERSON: The reason downwinders are so angry is because of their
personal tragic experience with radioactive fallout. Many were living
here during the above-ground testing that ended in 1963. They were
assured by the government that the tests were safe, that there was
nothing to fear. Claudia Peterson is a downwinder -- a cancer victim.

CLAUDIA PETERSON: My biggest fear as a child was what the Russians were
going to do to us, not what our own government was doing to us.

SEVERSON: It wasn't until the late 1970s when the truth came out that
the U.S. government had deliberately timed dozens of atomic atmospheric
explosions on days when the wind blew across communities in rural
southern Utah. The wind carried dangerous levels of radiation. But the
news came as no surprise here.

Local cemeteries are filled with an unusually high number of cancer
victims. One was Mary Dixon's sister.

Ms. DIXON: We've lived with this legacy; we are still living with this
legacy. People are still getting sick from the fallout that happened in
the '50s and '60s. The way radiation works is it doesn't make you sick
right away. It mutates cells and affects you. And thyroid cancer, that
one that I got, can take up to 27 years to show its effects.

SEVERSON: But the radiation didn't stop in the West. It dusted
communities across America. The largest doses were in upstate New York.
The National Cancer Institute reports that there may be as many as
75,000 cases of thyroid cancer among those exposed, although the
institute says there is no "certain" link.

Ms. THOMAS: With the kind of breast cancer I got, they knew it was a
fallout-related one because it was the same kind the women in Nagasaki
and Hiroshima got so many years after the attack there.

SEVERSON: Finally, in the early 1980s, Congress determined that there
were indeed casualties of testing and set up a fund to award victims
and their families, particularly those who suffered specific kinds of
thyroid cancer and leukemia. By mid-June of 2002, 4,200 downwinders had
been compensated.

The only Utah politician who voted against a new study was Congressman
Jim Matheson. It was his father, Governor Scott Matheson, who
spearheaded the battle to get compensation. A few years later, his
father died of one of the cancers covered in the downwind legislation.

Rep. JIM MATHESON (D-UT): It was a situation where the government lied,
and it's something that a lot of people in southern Utah feel strongly
about; and it touched my family in many ways, so I feel strongly as
well.

SEVERSON: The government argues that new tests would be safer, because
they will be conducted underground. People here disagree.

Rep. MATHESON: Even the underground tests did emit radiation into the
atmosphere, so I don't feel that it's safe just because it's
underground. It may be different from the above-ground testing, but it
still causes a lot of concern for me.

SEVERSON: Over the years, southern Utah has become a popular retirement
center with thousands of new residents, some of whom are more inclined
to trust the judgment of the government. Russ Butcher is a retired
computer scientist.

RUSS BUTCHER (Retired Computer Scientist): Because of the way I feel
about our way of life and how we've gotten to where we are as Americans
and the type of freedom we enjoy, and I know it's under constant
threat, if it requires nuclear [weapons], then I would have to say I am
for it. I think America will always be trusted not to use something
like that unless it is an absolute must.

FRED ESPLIN (Vice President of Relations, University of Utah): I think
we have been far too cavalier in assuming our own virtues and our
motives in this.

SEVERSON: Many Utahans, like Fred Esplin, a downwinder, understand the
administration's "compelling" reasons to upgrade our nuclear arsenal
but still question the morality and wisdom of it.

Mr. ESPLIN: I do believe that the United States is and continues to be
the last best hope for democratic reform around the world. How we go
about it, and whether we are throwing our weight around or whether we
work collaboratively and cooperatively with other people, has long-term
implications. We have had far too much of the former and far too little
of the latter.

SEVERSON: Congressional supporters say just because $29 million has
been approved for research doesn't mean the government will actually
get down to testing. But arms control analyst Baker Spring says he
won't be at all surprised if testing resumes as soon as possible.

Mr. SPRING: No, I wouldn't be, and the reason I wouldn't be is that
most people agree that if you're going to treat an entirely new nuclear
weapon, you're going to need to test it. ...

Mr. ESPLIN: There are all of the assurances of safety, but you have
people that have been burned once and aren't prepared to be burned
twice, literally burned once and don't want to be burned again.

Mr. SPRING: Is it completely risk free? No activity is. But I think we
can clearly reassure the people of Nevada and Utah that there is going
to be absolutely ironclad commitment to making this activity as safe
and reliable as possible.

Ms. DIXON: I cannot ever again believe assurances that this is 100
percent safe. I just cannot believe assurances anymore. I will always
be skeptical.

SEVERSON: The earliest testing could resume is 2006. By then, there
will be intense public debate that will reach beyond the safety,
security, and strategic concerns to the moral implications of resuming
nuclear testing. For RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY, I'm Lucky Severson
from St. George, Utah.

Strategies Against
Climate Change


The deadlock between on the one hand environmental NGOs warning of the
dangers of global warming and on the other hand spokespersons for the
United States government has on the face of it many similarities with
the inertial deadlock of the later Cold War period (as analysed by the
theorists of the non-aligned peace movements in the 1980s).

Just as the SALT treaties for the reduction of strategic nuclear
armaments were continually obstructed by Republicans in the U.S. Senate
in the 70s, so the 1997 Treaty of Kyoto " a very inadequate first
step towards curbing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere " is
being blocked by the intransigence of their present-day counterparts
(including, once again, a Russian element, for the Russian
government"s support for Kyoto has been looking decidedly shaky since
early December 2003).

The anti-nuclear weapons movement that arose in Europe in the 80s
represented an attempt to break through the deadlock of the Cold War
system. The approach was epitomised in the writings of E.P. Thompson,
whose answer to the question: "What is the Cold War about?" was:
"It is about itself. The Cold War is a show which was put, by two
rival entrepreneurs, upon the road in 1946 or 1947."

The nuclear arms race, which should have been brought to an end in
1991, was an objective product of the Cold War deadlock. The global
warming deadlock has generated a corresponding "objective product",
whose outlines can be seen emerging in the global warming debate that
was taking place in the mid-nineties. It is called
"geoengineering". At the time of the Kyoto conference (and for a
time afterwards) a number of articles were appearing in the popular
scientific press that appeared to be trying to rally public support for
geoengineering.

One of their favourite themes was that global warming is a technical,
not a moral problem and so should not be allowed to be the monopoly of
ecological non-governmental organizations pursuing an anti-development
agenda. Such organizations were later said to be responsible for the
decision at Kyoto to impose a fifteen percent cut on global emissions
of greenhouse gases over the next decade. Economically this was seen as
an indefensible decision , one likely to cost in the order of $250
billion a year, without taking into account the cost of losing the
goods, services and innovations whose production would be halted or
forgone.

The geoengineering proposal of consciously altering atmospheric
chemistry and conditions, of mitigating the effects of greenhouse
gases, was put forward as an alternative to calling for reduction of
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions.

Geoengineering included land, sea and air-based components. Some of the
remedies it was proposing, like large-scale planting of trees, appeared
uncontroversial and in fact worthy of support. Others, such as the
"Geritol" cure of sowing iron filings into the oceans to stimulate
the growth of carbon-consuming phytoplankton, seemed more problematic.
Others again, such as the "sunscreen" proposal of scattering
millions of tons of metallic particles in the atmosphere to reflect
sunlight back into space before it could be emitted in heat radiation
and then absorbed by carbon dioxide, were probably judged by most
geoengineering theorists to be virtually impossible to sell to the
public.

Nevertheless, in the mid-nineties, valiant attempts were made to give
geoengineering a good name. Gregory Benford, professor of physics at
the University of California, estimated that the Arctic and Antarctic
Oceans could be seeded with iron dust for between $10 million and $1
billion a year. 15 ships steaming across the polar oceans all year
long, dumping iron dust in lanes, would bring the total to around $10
billion. "This would soak up about a third of our global fossil-fuel
generated carbon dioxide emissions each year."

"Even better than dust would be microscopic droplets of sulphuric
acid. Sulphate aerosols can also raise the number of droplets that make
clouds condense, further increasing overall reflectivity. Coal-burning
freighter ships releasing sulphates into the atmosphere could also
spread iron dust into the sea, combining both approaches, with some
economies."

Probably the best-known of the aerial geoengineering proposals was that
put forward in 1997 by Edward Teller and entitled "Global Warming and
the Ice Ages: Prospects for Physics-Based Modulation of Global
Change" subsequently popularised in the Wall Street Journal in an
article entitled "The Planet Needs a Sunscreen".

Teller proposed deliberate, large-scale introduction of reflective
particles into the upper atmosphere, a task he claimed could be
achieved for less than $1 billion a year, between 0.1 and 1.0 percent
of the $100 billion he estimated it would cost to bring fossil fuel
usage in the United States back down to 1990 levels, as required by the
Treaty of Kyoto.

Characteristic of the politics of Teller is the fact that he both
ridiculed the idea of global warming and at the same time put forward
what he represented as a solution to global warming. "For some
reason," Teller observed sarcastically, "This option isn't as
fashionable as all-out war on fossil fuels and the people who use
them."

Teller, who is of course known to history as the father of the hydrogen
bomb and of the Star Wars missile defence programme, has not always
succeeded in getting his pet schemes adopted. His ambitious plan, for
example, for using hydrogen bombs to construct harbours in the United
States, never made the move from the drawing board into reality. His
sarcasm reflected a genuine problem: that of persuading the public that
permanent mobilisation of thousands of aircraft to fly day and night,
365 days a year, over land and sea spraying toxic metals over the
human, animal and plant populations underneath is a desirable, or even
in any way defensible, proposal.

Gregory Benford was sensitive to the public relations difficulties. He
said: "If geoengineers are painted early and often as Dr.
Strangeloves of the air, they will fail. Properly portrayed as allies
of science--and true environmentalism--they could become heroes. Not
letting the radical greens set the terms of discussion will matter
crucially. "

One theoretician who helped keep radical greens out of the debate, and
may even have succeeded in co-opting some radical greens into the
debate, was the Stanford University environmental law student Jay
Michaelson, whose "Geo-engineering: A Climate Change Manhattan
Project", was published in 1998 in his university"s environmental
law journal. Like the name of Edward Teller, the title of
Michaelson"s paper is a standing reminder of the continuity between
geoengineering and the nuclear arms race. The paper is a masterful
attempt to defend the indefensible. Asserting that geoengineering
offers hope for solving climate change "beyond the too-little,
too-lates of Kyoto", Michaelson"s basic thesis is that "in a
world where it is very expensive to reduce greenhouse emissions, those
who care about the problem should support a policy that will work with
those who don"t."

Michaelson outlines three possible responses to climate change: 1)
addressing its root causes, 2) doing nothing and adapting to climate
change as it occurs and 3) trying to solve the climate change problem
directly via geoengineering.

The impediments to addressing the root causes are the economic cost of
cutting back on fossil fuel use, the social costs in a context of
generalised dependence on automobiles, the question of equity, given
the objection of the nations of the South to having to bear the cost of
problems created by the North, and the harsh fact that enforcement of a
regulatory regime forces most countries to go against their immediate
interests.

The advantages of the second alternative, doing nothing, is that if
predictions are correct, climate change is soon going to cease to be
what Michaelson calls "an absent problem". Increasingly disastrous
evidence of the reality of climatic change will probably make it easier
to gain consensus on preventive regulation. But the problem by then
will have become one of choice of priorities: what and who should be
saved and what and who abandoned?

These disadvantages led Michaelson, as he says, to the third solution
of geoengineering. Geoengineering would shift priorities away from
researching into whether the globe is warming into practical solutions
that can be started immediately. It would not necessitate making
greater demands on the developing world than on developed countries. It
would indeed allow the developing world to be "a free rider" on a
project financed mostly by the industrialized nations. 

"Because it would restrict growth in the developing world less than 
regulation would, it would allow developing nations to progress more 
quickly away from the serious environmental threats of unsafe water, 
unhealthy air, and topsoil loss, through proven means such as sewage 
treatment, newer (cleaner) automobiles and factories, and modern agriculture." By
relying on technological innovation and development, geoengineering
would increase the role of private actors relative to that of
government. Instead of requiring widespread enforcement of complex and
growth-threatening rules, geoengineering would give private firms a
financial incentive to help solve the climate change problem."

For all his ostensible commitment to geoengineering, Michaelson
conceded that in the final analysis "geoengineering runs afoul of
almost every major trend in contemporary environmentalism."
"Geritol cures" and "earth sunscreens" treat shallow symptoms,
not deep causes, and fail to "kill two birds with one stone" as
would a serious programme of combating deforestation or cutting
greenhouse gas emissions". There is much circumstantial evidence
that he would really have liked the controversial character of his own
proposals to contribute to developing a political climate that would
make possible the implementation of real solutions to global warming.

"If serious debate were to emerge," he says, "shock at
geoengineering might wane in the context of rational reflection of the
costs of climate change." But for the emergence of such a serious
debate to be triggered by public shock at realisation of what is being
proposed, and not only proposed but done, by the geoengineers,
geoengineering must be publicly acknowledged, must be the subject of
public debate, like genetically modified foods, cloning or nuclear
power, all of which have interest groups publicly lobbying for and
against them.

The wholehearted public embrace of geoengineering advocated by Benford,
Michaelson and others in the nineties has not happened. The media has
not tried to make geoengineers into heroes and portray them as allies
of science and true environmentalism. Many global warming sceptics are
even on record as saying that reports of geoengineering activities -
aircraft engaged in large-scale spraying of aerosols in the upper
atmosphere, could not be genuine - that such activities could not be
occurring because they are not needed and would be criminal.

The big environmental NGOs such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth or
WWF do not try to glamorise or otherwise promote geoengineering. They
simply act as if it is not occurring. Their silence, to look at its
positive aspect, possibly reflects a refusal to be associated with the
task of making geoengineering look respectable.

The "invisibility" of geoengineering is perpetuated through official
denial. The US Air Force, whose KC-135R and KC-10 tanker planes have
become a familiar sight in many different parts of the world as they
engage in the daily particulate scattering operations of the "sunscreen"
programme, on its official site describes eyewitness accounts of these
operations as "a hoax that has been around since 1996." 

"The Air Force", it says "is not conducting any weather modification
experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future."  The
"hoax" accusation is energetically echoed by the seemingly large numbers
 of "debunkers" frequenting chemtrail/geoengineering discussion forums,
generating considerable confusion, as well as resentment at their
characterisation  as "chemmies" (a variant on "commies") those who wish
to draw attention to  the mysterious lines in the sky. Moreover, all
elected politicians in the world  above the municipal level, if they
have heard at all of geoengineering,  believe, or profess to believe,
the official story that the sunscreen climate  mitigation programme is
"a hoax".

One reason for the successful conspiracy of silence may well be the
still  unresolved status of geoengineering under international law. This
is an issue  that was being investigated, again in the mid-nineties, by
the environmental  lawyer Bodansky. Among the questions he raised were:
who should make  geoengineering decisions? Should all countries be able
to participate in decision-making?  (since all will be affected and
there will be both positive and negative impacts). How should liability
and compensation for damages be handled? From the  legal viewpoint,
schemes to inject particles into the atmosphere are purportedly  among
the most problematic of all geoengineering proposals because the 
atmosphere above any country is part of its airspace. Nations lay claim
to their  airspace and may act on the claims, for example, by shooting
down aircraft.  Geoengineering activity in the atmosphere could be
viewed as infringements of national sovereignty. Obviously, the simplest
way of dealing with legal problems of  this kind, pending negotiation of
the necessary adjustments to international  law, is to deny that any
such activity is occurring.

The publication on the internet in 2003 of an interview with an alleged 
"insider" of the sunscreen programme (this is not its official name)
working at the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory cast further
light on the difficulties  involved in trying to promote a favourable
image of geoengineering. Starting  from the question of why polymer
threads embedded with "biological material" have been found in residues
from aerosol spraying, the insider (given the  pseudonym "Deep Shield")
explained that "since the suspended particles eventually  do settle into
the lowest part of the atmosphere and are inhaled by all life  forms on
the surface, there is an attempt to counter the growth of mould by 
adding to the mixture mould growth suppressants, some of which may be of
 biological material."

Deep Shield acknowledged the potential of the aerosol spaying to cause
sickness: "Some people are more sensitive to the metals, while others
are sensitive  to the polymer chemicals. It is true that people will get
sick, and some will  die. The World Health Organization has carried out
most of the relevant  studies. Some have said the ill effects will be
minimal, along the lines of a  million or so, while others have found
the numbers to be far higher " 3 or 4  billion. The Accepted Estimated
Casualties (from the World Health Organization) is 2 billion over the
course of six decades. The majority will be either the  elderly or those
who are prone to respiratory problems."

Emphasising the "globalist" aspects of the operations and the need to 
"ensure the chemicals are not tampered with" Deep Shield claims that
"they are  mixed and sprayed over random nations. This means that
chemicals produced in the  USA have a good chance of being sprayed over
Russia. Russian planes may be seen  in US skies, but so too will US
planes be seen in Russian skies. The  canisters are sealed in a third
nation that has no idea where its canister is going. All of this is to
ensure that that the shield is not used as a weapon. Non-participant
nations are sprayed by participant nations, who must spray in order to 
get enough material to maintain their nation"s shield. It is understood
that  not spraying is as much a military offence as shooting at the
planes."

One implication of this spraying of non-participant nations by
"participant  nations" is that, following the defeat of Saddam Hussein"s
Ba"ath regime in  Iraq, all of the Middle East " possibly including
Israel, where spraying has  started in recent months " is now being
sprayed from bases in Iraq.

According to Deep Shield ordinary commercial aircraft are involved in
the  particulate scattering operations and are not diverted from their
regular flight  paths. "But the combined resources of the nations of
earth are not enough to  allow constant spraying. Though we have
achieved a high level of technology,  there is a great surface area that
needs to be covered nearly daily. Large  sections of ocean are all but
ignored. The remaining land masses are more than what  can be covered
efficiently."

Far from seeing his work as something to be proudly publicised, Deep
Shield  sees the existing secrecy as necessary to maintain public calm
for as long as  possible: "The Earth is dying. Humanity is on the road
to extinction. Without  the shield, mankind will die off within twenty
to fifty years. Most people  alive today could live to see this
extinction take place. This means that an announcement of the situation
we face boils down to telling every man, woman and  child on earth that
they have no future, they are going to be killed. People  would panic.
There would be economic collapse, the production and movement of  goods
would collapse. Millions would die in all cities on earth. Riots and 
violence would reduce civilian centres to rubble within days."

The secrecy of the sunscreen project was justified to him, Deep Shield
says,  on grounds of national security. "All those who know are expected
to remain  silent. All those who suspect are either faced with trying to
prove the  virtually unprovable or are faced with good enough reasons to
remain silent. I would  assume that this situation is worldwide and this
could be considered as one of the dangers of the project. I can see why
there is a desire to repress the  information, not that spraying is
taking place but the face that we are facing a  period of human history
which might be the end of civilization."

The stance of Deep Shield is deeply irrational, permeated by the same 
psychosis as the US government"s "War on Terrorism". People whose
conscience is  clear do not think in this way. What Deep Shield says is
nothing more or less than  what many, particularly in the ecological
milieu say to themselves, and to others, every day: that humanity is on
the path to self-destruction. National  security classification of the
sunscreen project is absolutely unjustifiable and  in total
contradiction to the logic, however unconvincing, within which 
geoengineering was proposed as one of a number of possible answers to
climatic  change. Geoengineering was meant to be not simply a
substitution for real action  on the environment, but also possibly a
facilitator of, and adjunct to, real action on the environment.
Something it cannot be if it remains secret.

David Stewart, who took the "Deep Shield" interviews, has quoted Deep
Shield  more recently as saying that the project is failing to do what
it should do.  He reports arguments (screaming matches) among the top
brass and  civilian-dressed military who come and go at the Lawrence
Livermore laboratory. The  arguments appear to Deep Shield to be about
the expense of the project, the  effectiveness and, more generally, the
long-term outlook for humanity. 

Although there  is no visible stack of
bodies, as Stewart puts it, of people killed by the aerosol spraying,
there is growing evidence of people dying from diseases  plausibly
traceable to the project. One black spot for casualties is in East
Texas,  where the initial tests for the spraying materials were carried
out in the  mid-90s. Projections of 1000% increases in Alzheimer"s
disease, one of the  side-effects of excessive exposure to aluminium,
over the next decades, have emerged in the media in the last year or so.

The sunscreen project is not the only reason for which aerosol spraying
is  taking place in the atmosphere. Spraying is also being carried out
to increase  electrical conductivity in the atmosphere, facilitating the
operations of  HAARP, the High Frequency Active Aural Research Program,
in Alaska. Also, some reports of the presence of disease bacteria in
aerosol spaying do not fit in with  Deep Shield"s explanation of
biological materials being spayed to combat the  growth of mould. This
suggests that black operations are also in progress,  parasitic on the
pseudo-public-interest applications of geoengineering technology  and on
personnel who believe that the purpose of their work is the mitigation 
of climate change. If the sunscreen project is being used as a cover for
other  even more illegal and apparently criminal purposes, this is
another argument  for opposing its secrecy.  Many other issues require
investigation. Is the current bonanza of cut-price airline tickets being
supported by state subsidies to airlines for their  services in
spreading particulate matter? If so, and if Deep Shield"s statements on 
the financing of the sunscreen project are correct, then this is being
done  at taxpayers" expense. Quite apart from any economic aspects, how
sane is it,  to have ever larger numbers of aircraft clogging the skies
and burning ever  larger amounts of fuel, in order to facilitate
management of global warming  caused by excessive burning of fossil
fuel? Can a policy of moving to non-fossil-fuel based economy really be
developed side by side with climate mitigation  policies of this kind,
if that is what they are?

Since the appearance of the first comprehensive study of global warming
by  the American National Academy of Sciences in 1992, the
geoengineering debate has  passed through a number of stages. The
mid-nineties (the period before and  after Kyoto) was the period of
hype, of extravagant claims. The post-Kyoto  period, apparently the
period when policy began to be implemented, was the period  when the
respectable proposals of the day before suddenly became 'conspiracy
theory'. The present period is one of controlled re-introduction of the
subject,  in such a way as not to expose the lies and omissions of the
preceding phase.


A recent article in the British "Guardian", under the title: "Earth is
20%  darker, say experts", reveals that "Human activity is making the
planet darker  as well as warmer." Scientists believe that "levels of
sunlight reaching  Earth's surface have declined by up to 20% in recent
years because air pollution  is reflecting it back into space and
helping to make bigger, longer-lasting  clouds." A certain Jim Hansen,
climate scientist with Nasa, is quoted as saying;  "Over the past couple
of years it's become clear that the solar irradiance at  the Earth's
surface has decreased." The article claims that global dimming is 
probably caused by "tiny particles such as soot, and chemical compounds
such  as sulphates accumulating in the atmosphere."

Returning to the subject of the deadlock over the Treaty of Kyoto
engendered  by the argument between defenders and opponents of global
warming (or by the  unilateralism of the United States government, as
European and other  international politicians like to tell us), the
international environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, Friends of
the Earth and WWF have shown through their  silence on geoengineering
that they are unwilling to help make it respectable by  lending support
to it. They should be given credit for that. But there  remains the task
of breaching the secrecy that surrounds the subject. Given that the 
ecological organizations are clearly not going to do this, we must
initiate discussions with them to decide who should be assigned the
task. Who is going  to bell the cat?

Bush moves toward 'Star Wars' missile defense February 2, 2004 By Jim
Wolf WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush is planning
to put the  first weapons in space despite broad international
opposition, budget papers sent to Congress on Monday showed.

Bush's spending plans for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 include an 
unspecified sum for developing and testing "advanced, lightweight,
space-based  (missile) interceptor components," the Pentagon's Missile
Defense Agency said.

In its budget overview, the agency said it was seeking $47 million to
start "technology development" of such weapons and others that could be
phased into a  multi-layered U.S. missile shield starting in January
2012.

In the two years thereafter, the Pentagon aims to base a handful of
missile  interceptors in orbit for testing, the agency said.


Any such setup, whether space-based lasers or interceptor rockets in
orbit,  could give the United States the means to attack enemy
satellites as well as  incoming warheads.

China, an emerging space power, has voiced strong objections to such
"weaponization" of space as have Russia and some U.S. European allies.

Although the heavens are already home to spy satellites and other
military and intelligence sensors that help weapons work, no offensive
or defensive arms are known to be in orbit yet.

Last year, the Missile Defense Agency obtained an initial $14 million
for research on a space-based interceptor "test bed," but no decision
has been made yet to deploy it.

The fiscal 2005 budget is the first to set aside funds to start
developing the kind of weapons President Ronald Reagan had in mind when
he called for a space-based Strategic Defense Initiative on March 23,
1983. Critics decried Reagan's vision as "Star Wars" for fear it would
launch an arms race in space.

GROUND-BASED MISSILE SHIELD

By Sept. 30 of this year, Bush is set to put on alert several
ground-based interceptor missiles at Fort Greely, Alaska, for an initial
shield against limited ballistic missile attacks from countries like
North Korea.


By December 2005, this bulwark will consist of up to 20 ground-based
interceptors in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, up
to 10 based on U.S. warships at sea plus upgraded radar stations and
communications links. The initial system is optimized to knock down any
long-range North Korean missiles that could carry nuclear, chemical or
biological warheads, though critics doubt the system -- such as it is --
could thwart a surprise attack.

Overall, Bush is seeking to boost funding for missile defense by 13
percent to $10.2 billion next year, including funds for the Army's
Patriot Advanced Capability-3 short-range missile interceptor program.

Boeing Co. (BA.N: Quote, Profile, Research) is the prime contractor for
the ground-based leg of missile defense. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC.N:
Quote, Profile, Research) is building the system's battle command,
control and communications system. Raytheon Co. (RTN.N: Quote, Profile,
Research) builds the interceptor's "kill vehicle" designed to obliterate
its target by slamming into it. Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N: Quote,
Profile, Research) and Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB.N: Quote, Profile,
Research) are building booster rockets.

Missile defense is the Pentagon's costliest weapons program. The new
budget projects $53.1 billion in related spending for the next five
fiscal years, up more than $3 billion for the five-year period projected
a year ago.

In addition, billions of dollars that had been earmarked for spending
from 2006 to 2010 are now due to be spent sooner -- a sign critics said
showed the program was behind schedule and over budget.

"What they're doing now are the simplest efforts," said Philip Coyle,
who stepped down in January 2001 as the Pentagon's top weapons
evaluator. "The later years aren't going to be any less expensive (than
forecast last year) -- and that's especially true because the system has
become more complex," he said in a telephone interview.

      Subject:  Fed: Robert Redford- call to
DEFEAT THE ENERGY BILL

      ----- Original Message -----

      From: Susannesaltzman@a...

      Over the next few weeks, President Bush and his congressional
      allies will try once again to ram their disastrous energy bill
      through the U.S. Senate. They fell only two votes short in
      November and they've vowed to make passage of the bill their top
      priority now that Congress has returned from recess. This bill
      may be the worst piece of legislation you and I will see in our
      lifetimes. It would pick your pocket, despoil your natural
      heritage, endanger your family's health and smother your hope for
      a more secure energy future. We ignore this bill at our own
      peril.

      Let me tell you our simple plan for thwarting this shameless
      attack on our environment and pocketbooks. If millions of
      Americans each took one minute to protest this bill, it would
      cause every senator who is tempted to vote for it to think twice
      about doing so.

      You can make this happen within the next few hours by doing two
      things: First, go to http://snipurl.com/3zb7

      http://www.savebiogems.org/takeaction.asp?src=RR0401 and send
      your two senators an email or fax, telling them to vote against
      this pro-polluter energy bill. Then, forward my email to at least
      four of your friends, family members or colleagues.

      I am emailing this message to 500,000 BioGems Defenders and other
      NRDC activists. If each one forwards this message to just four
      more people, we will generate a national tidal wave of opposition
      before this day is over. And that won't be a moment too soon.
      This disgraceful bill would pick our pockets to hand out billions
      of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to the oil, coal and nuclear
      industries. That's their long-awaited reward for making big-time
      contributions to the Bush-Cheney campaign. They profit while the
      rest of us pay the price -- in tax dollars and environmental
      degradation.

      This bill gives the energy giants a free pass to drill their way
      through our last wild places, burn more dirty coal, build a new
      generation of risky nuclear power plants and dramatically
      increase air pollution that would sicken the vulnerable --
      especially children and seniors -- for decades to come. It would
      establish oil and gas development as the dominant use of our
      federal public lands, open national parks to the construction of
      electricity transmission lines, exempt polluters from core
      provisions of our clean air and water laws and waive liability
      for the producers of the toxic gasoline additive MTBE -- even
      though it has contaminated at least 1,500 public water supplies
      in all 50 American states. You'd be hard-pressed to come up with
      a more backward-looking, wasteful and self-defeating energy
      "plan" than this one.

      At a time when the federal deficit is soaring and we're going to
      war in the Persian Gulf oilfields, the White House wants to stick
      us with the tab for prolonging our destructive dependence on
      fossil fuels, foreign oil and dangerous nuclear technology. This
      is not a national energy policy. This is corporate welfare, pure
      and simple.

      Estimates of the bill's corporate tax breaks range from $23
      billion to well over $100 billion with loan guarantees included.
      No surprise there. Big energy companies cooked up this raid on
      the federal treasury during hundreds of secret meetings with Vice
      President Cheney's energy task force and their allies on Capitol
      Hill. It's one thing to gouge taxpayers. But to claim this
      rip-off is in the national interest, as the White House would
      have us believe, is a slap in the face to every working American.

      Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of voters -- of both
      parties --understand that we simply must reduce our
      out-of-control appetite for fossil fuels if we ever are to secure
      energy independence. That means turning American rooftops into
      the Persian Gulf of solar energy. It means producing cars that
      get 40 miles per gallon. It means constructing efficient
      buildings that use half the energy of the average American office
      without sacrificing comfort. Making this transformation to a
      super-efficient, low-pollution economy would save consumers
      upwards of a trillion dollars, spare our last wild places from
      destruction, improve our health, slow global warming and reduce
      our dependence on undemocratic regimes overseas.

      It's a no-brainer to anyone living outside the White House. But
      unless millions of Americans speak out right now, the enactment
      of the president's energy bill will doom us to an apocalyptic
      future of blighted wilderness, poisonous air pollution,
      devastating climate change and endless wars over fossil fuels.

      Please make your voice heard. Go to http://snipurl.com/4a5l

      http://www.savebiogems.org/takeaction.asp?src=RR0401 and tell
      your senators to obey the will of the American people, *not* the
      dictates of giant energy corporations! Call on Congress to create
      a sustainable and affordable energy path.

      And please be sure to forward this message to at least four other
      people. Believe me, millions of Americans are just waiting for a
      simple way to stop this madness and lend their support to a sane
      and hopeful energy future.

      Sincerely yours,

Pakistani Scientist Admits That He Passed On
Nuclear Secrets
By DAVID ROHDE

Published: February 4, 2004


SLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 4 - In an extraordinary
announcement, Abdul Qadeer Khan, the revered
founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program,
appeared on national television early this
evening, admitted he had shared Pakistani nuclear
technology with other countries and asked the
nation for forgiveness.

     Advertisement


"I take full responsibility for my actions," the
scientist, once one of the most powerful men in
Pakistan, said in a soft voice, "and seek your
pardon."

Wearing glasses, a tan suit jacket and a striped
tie, Dr. Khan, 66, said his "unauthorized
proliferation activities" were "based in good
faith, but errors in judgment."

He said he acted entirely on his own and did not
have the permission of his superiors to share the
technology.

"There was never, ever any kind of authority for
these activities from the government," he said.

Pakistani government officials said the country's
National Command Authority, a group of senior
military and civilian officials who oversee
Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, met this evening to
decide whether to prosecute Dr. Khan and six of
his aides accused of carrying out the
proliferation.

A senior Pakistani official said General Musharraf
would announce the government's decision on
Thursday.

On Sunday a senior Pakistani official said a
government investigation had found that the
scientist had shared Pakistan's nuclear technology
with Iran, Libya and North Korea for more than a
decade. In what appears to be one of the most
successful efforts to evade antiproliferation
controls in history, Dr. Khan sent nuclear-weapons
related parts, plans and designs to the three
countries with the aid of middlemen from Sri
Lanka, Germany and the Netherlands.

Pakistani analysts said it was unlikely that Dr.
Khan would be prosecuted.

A series of carefully scripted events today
appeared to be designed to quickly put the issue
to rest.

Analysts have said that it would have been nearly
impossible for Dr. Khan to have passed on such
information without the tacit approval of the
country's powerful army.

This morning Dr. Khan met President Pervez
Musharraf, a general who seized power in a 1999
coup, and asked for a pardon for his activities.

In silent footage shown on national television
earlier in the day, a forlorn-looking Dr. Khan was
seen leaning forward, alternately pressing his
hands together and waving them in the air, as he
spoke to General Musharraf.

The general, sitting stiffly and dressed in a
commando uniform, looked at him sternly and said
nothing, with his hands clasped in his lap.

At the outset of the speech, Dr. Khan said he was
appearing "with the deepest sense of sorrow,
anguish and regret." His statement today, which
his supporters said was coerced and humiliating,
marked an ignoble end for a scientist lauded in
Pakistan but derided in the West.

Dr. Khan was convicted of stealing plans for a
high-speed centrifuge, which can be used to
produce enriched uranium, a key component in a
nuclear bomb, from a European company in the
1970's. The conviction was overturned on appeal.

In Pakistan he was hailed for achieving a miracle
by overcoming a huge American effort to prevent
Pakistan from acquiring the technology to enrich
the uranium. He is the only Pakistani to have been
twice awarded the nation's highest civilian award.

Dr. Khan is rumored to own dozens of houses across
Pakistan. American investigators suspect that he
has profited handsomely from the nuclear black
market.

Senior Pakistani officials told them that Dr. Khan
said he shared technology with three to four other
Muslim countries in the hope that the creation of
more nuclear-armed Muslim nations would ease
Western attention on Pakistan's program.

A senior official said Dr. Khan had no good answer
for why he shared technology with North Korea.
"None of his explanations were satisfactory," the
official said.

In recent days, as a resolution to the
investigation approached, Pakistani officials had
toned down their comments about Dr. Khan's
corruption. A senior official said today that Dr.
Khan was "partly driven by financial motivations."

American analysts have said the key is not whether
Dr. Khan is severely punished. It is whether the
United States is given as much detail as possible
about the nuclear smuggling network. They said
eliminating that network, which appears far more
difficult than keeping states from producing
weapons, is now critical for the United States.

In Pakistan, the scientist's confession
represented the collapse of an esteemed national
institution - the country's nuclear program. The
program, which was begun in the 1970's to counter
India's nuclear arsenal, was a source of enormous
national pride.

Pakistani military analysts said they believed
that senior military officials must have at least
tacitly approved of Dr. Khan's activities over the
years, particularly those that involved the
shipment of nuclear hardware out of the country.
The inquiry by the military-led government found
that senior military and intelligence officials
were guilty of "omissions," but did not actively
take part in the scheme.

A former senior American diplomat who served in
Pakistan said on Monday that he believed
successive Pakistani military and civilian leaders
intentionally turned a blind eye to Dr. Khan's
activities for a decade.

The former diplomat said Dr. Khan produced things
Pakistani leaders felt they needed to counter
their nuclear-armed rival India, such as ballistic
missile technology from North Korea. Dr. Khan also
became such a potent political force in his own
right that no one dared challenge him.

"It's like Iran-Contra, they didn't want to know,"
said the former diplomat, referring to the Reagan
administration scandal. "They needed the things he
brought them."

A.Q. Khan's Apology to Pakistanis
Published: February 4, 2004

Following is the text of the statement by Adbul
Qadeer Khan read out on state television, as
provided by Agence-France Presse:

My dear ladies and gentlemen, Assalam-ul Alaikum,
it is with the deepest sense of sorrow, anguish
and regret that I have chosen to appear before you
in order to atone for some of the anguish and pain
that have been suffered with the people of
Pakistan on account of the extremely unfortunate
events of the last two months.

I am aware of the vital criticality of Pakistan's
nuclear program to our national security and the
national pride and emotion which it generates in
your heart.

I am also conscious that any untoward event,
incident or threat to this national security draws
the greatest concern in the nation's psyche.

It is in this context that the recent
international events and their fall out on
Pakistan have traumatized the nation.

I have much to answer for. The recent
investigations was ordered with the government of
Pakistan consequent to the disturbing disclosures
and evidence by some countries to international
agencies relating to alleged proliferation
activities by certain Pakistanis and foreigners
over the last two decades.

The investigations have established that many of
the reported activities did occur and these were
inevitably initiated at my behest.

In my interviews with the concerned government
officials I was confronted with the evidence and
findings and I have voluntarily admitted that much
of it is true and accurate.

My dear brothers and sisters I have chose to
appear before you to offer my deepest regrets and
unqualified apologies to a traumatized nation. I
am aware of the high esteem, love and affection in
which you have held me for my services to national
security and I am grateful for all the awards and
honor that have been bestowed upon me.

However it pains me to realize in retrospect that
my entire lifetime achievements of providing
foolproof national security to my nation could
have been placed in serious jeopardy on account of
my activities which were based in good faith but
on errors of judgment related to unauthorized
proliferation activities.

I wish to place on record that those of my
subordinates who have accepted their role in the
affair were acting in good faith like me on my
instructions.

I also wish to clarify that there was never ever
any kind of authorization for these activities by
the government.

I take full responsibility for my actions and seek
your pardon.

I give an assurance my dear brothers and sisters
such activities will never take place in the
future.

I also appeal to all citizens of Pakistan in the
supreme national interest to refrain from any
further speculations and not to politicize this
extremely sensitive issue of national security.
May Allah keep Pakistan safe and secure. Pakistan
Paindabad! [Long Live Pakistan!].

U.K. teen avoids jail for nuclear hacking
Andy McCue, Special to CNET News.com
Published: February 3, 2004


A University of Exeter student who hacked into
U.S. Department of Energy computers dedicated to
U.S. energy supplies and nuclear weapons has been
sentenced to 200 hours community service at
Southwark Crown Court in London.

Joseph James McElroy, 18, of Woodford Green in
London, had been found guilty of unauthorized
modification of computer data and of impairing the
performance of a computer under section three of
the 1990 Computer Misuse Act at Bow Street
Magistrates in December.

In sentencing, Judge Goymer told McElroy that it
was understandable that the U.S. government at
first thought a terrorist attempt had been made to
compromise its computers, which are responsible
for energy supplies and for the integrity and
safety of U.S. nuclear weapons.

McElroy accessed 17 computers at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Chicago in June
2002, which contained both classified and
nonclassified data on atomic weapons and research.

But he had only used spare storage space on the
labs' computers and broadband access to upload
pirated movies, software and games for him and his
friends to use. He had also password-protected
this space.

Lab staff only noticed the systems had been
compromised when backups started slowing down and
taking much longer than usual. An investigation
involving U.S. authorities and Scotland Yard's
computer crime unit uncovered McElroy's e-mail
address, and he was arrested in July last year.

The U.S. government had claimed £21,215 ($38,975)
in costs for the three days it took to clean and
repair the hard drives, during which time vital
research data was unavailable.

Judge Goymer said McElroy had no means to pay
those costs as he had already accrued £3,000
($5,510) in student debt in his first year at
university.

But he said this should be a warning to those who
think hacking into computers is a "joke" or a
"hobby" and that anyone in the future found guilty
of such offences will face custodial sentences.

"This is a serious offence," he said. "Computers
are an important feature of life in the 21st

Experts Worry Terrorists Have Nuke Plans
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Published: February 4, 2004
Filed at 2:01 p.m. ET

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The nuclear black
market that let Iran, Libya and North Korea
acquire weapons technology from Pakistan under the
noses of international monitors raises suspicions
that terror groups also acquired bomb components
or plans, experts told The Associated Press.

Al-Qaida apparently has shown interest in
acquiring nuclear technology. Two Pakistani
nuclear scientists were detained in late 2001
after meeting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan on
suspicion of giving away secrets, but they were
later released without being charged. The
military, which controlled the weapons program,
also is known to have elements who sympathize with
the Taliban and bin Laden.

Pakistan has for years denied spreading nuclear
technology and claimed its arsenal was safe from
extremists. But strong international pressure
after Iranian revelations to the U.N. nuclear
watchdog forced Islamabad to begin an
investigation of its weapons program in November.
It admitted last month for the first time that
scientists had leaked technology.

Officials say Abdul Qadeer Khan -- the father of
Pakistan's nuclear program -- has confessed to
selling equipment related to centrifuges, which
are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, to
Iran, Libya and North Korea. Libya also received
designs for a nuclear bomb from Pakistan that it
handed over to U.S. and British intelligence last
month, European diplomats say.

Khan, however, has denied making a confession,
according to the leading Islamic party,
Jamaat-e-Islami.

Pakistan itself relied on international black
market supplies for the equipment used in its
nuclear weapons program that started in the 1970s.

``If the black market could transfer technology
from Europe to Pakistan in spite of all these
sanctions and embargoes, that same black market of
smugglers can also pass on materials from this lab
to terrorist groups,'' said A.H. Nayyar, a nuclear
physicist and head of the Pakistan Peace
Coalition. ``The possibility exists and needs to
be investigated thoroughly.''

Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan on
Tuesday denied that Pakistani nuclear technology
had fallen into terrorist hands. ``It's absolutely
negative, there is no truth in it,'' he said.

The government also has denied official complicity
in giving away technology, but a friend of Khan's
told the AP that top army officials, including
now-President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, were ``aware
of everything.''

White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the
Bush administration accepted Musharraf's
assurances that the Pakistani government was ``not
involved in any kind of proliferation.''

Musharraf has said the scientists were given wide
latitude to develop the nuclear program and worked
in secret even from top officials. That secrecy
also has raised fears that nuclear workers may
have transferred technology or equipment to
terrorists, either for money or ideological
sympathy.

Experts say centrifuge technology wouldn't be of
much use to terror groups, who probably couldn't
set up the vast facilities required to enrich
useful quantities of uranium, with hundreds of
technicians needed to run thousands of
centrifuges.

``It's hard enough for countries to do,'' said
Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert at the
London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies.

The acquisition of weapons designs, however, would
make it far easier for terrorists to make a
workable bomb, said David Albright, head of the
Institute for Science and International Security
in Washington.

And if a terror group was able to obtain highly
enriched uranium -- anywhere from about 110 to 220
pounds -- it could possibly build a bomb similar
in design to that used on Hiroshima, Japan, at the
end of World War II, experts said.

``It's not something that you or I could do in our
backyards, but it's relatively easy,'' Samore
said.

Pakistan is estimated to have produced more than
1,540 pounds of highly enriched uranium, but no
official figures have ever been released.

``It is very important that all the material that
has been produced is accounted for to the last
gram,'' said Nayyar. ``If it is not done, then the
doubt remains.''

Sultan, the military spokesman, declined to
comment on whether Khan's alleged confession
mentioned highly enriched uranium and potential
leaks of it outside Pakistan.

The strongest known link between Pakistani
scientists and terrorists were the 2001 arrests
Sultan Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood and Abdul Majid, who
worked for Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission
until retiring in 1999. The commission, together
with Khan's lab worked on the nuclear weapons
program.

Mahmood's son told the AP in December 2002 that
his father -- a deeply conservative Muslim who
sympathized with the Taliban -- met bin Laden
several times between 2000 and July 2001 and the
al-Qaida leader asked how to make nuclear bombs.
Mahmood claimed to have rebuffed the request,
telling bin Laden ``it is not child's play for you
to build a nuclear bomb,'' according to his son,
who didn't want to be named.

The scientists were cleared of all charges and
released in December 2001.

``Pakistani scientists were active there (in
Afghanistan) -- we never got to the bottom of
it,'' said Albright, also a former Iraq nuclear
weapons inspector.

In light of recent news, the years of Pakistani
denials ring especially hollow, Albright said,
hoping international pressure would finally make
Pakistan come clean.

``There's a lot of smoke and mirrors that the
government is throwing up, but at the same time
it's being forced to reveal information,'' he
said.

Barton: Lawmaker seen as pro Yucca Mountain 
By STEVE TETREAULT
PVT WASHINGTON BUREAU 

 
WASHINGTON - One of the most ardent federal promoters of nuclear waste burial 
at Yucca Mountain is in line to become chairman of the powerful House Energy 
and Commerce Committee, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday. 

Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is considered the frontrunner to succeed Rep. Billy 
Tauzin, R-La., who announced late Tuesday he was stepping down from the 
chairmanship on Feb. 16 and won't be running for re-election. 

"This is a disaster for the state of Nevada," said Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-
Nev. "Joe Barton's name might as well be Joe Nuclear." 

Others said the impact might not be that severe. 

Barton, 54, presently is head of the energy and air quality subcommittee. A 
proponent of fossil and nuclear energy development, he has advanced bills 
supporting a repository for permanent storage of radioactive waste and spent 
nuclear fuel now kept in 39 states. 

Barton in 2002 was the main House sponsor of the bill that overturned Gov. 
Kenny Guinn's veto of the Yucca Mountain Project. The bill cleared the way 
for Congress to ratify the mountain ridge 50 miles from Pahrump and 20 miles 
north and east of Amargosa Valley and Beatty, respectively. 

The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported Wednesday that Tauzin has 
received an offer to become president of the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturing Association. 

Barton said in a statement he is actively seeking the chairmanship and has 
discussed it with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas. It was not clear when a new leader would be named. 

Berkley said a Barton promotion would increase the clout of the nuclear power 
industry. She said she was unaware of any other candidate and most lawmakers 
believe Barton has sewed up the promotion. 

"He did everything he could to promote Yucca Mountain as a repository," 
Berkley said. "He will continue to lead the charge to bury nuclear waste in 
Nevada, except now he will have more power to do it." 

Others said changes might be less noticeable. The 57-member energy committee 
is dominated by lawmakers who support development of nuclear power and other 
energy sources no matter who would be at the helm, some said. 

"They've always been pro-Yucca, I don't see much changing," said Michele 
Boyd, legislative representative for the Public Citizen Critical Mass Energy 
and Environment Program, a watchdog group that opposes the repository. 

Also, Boyd said the focus has evolved to how much money should be spent on 
the Yucca Mountain Project each year, a matter that is debated in other 
committees. 

Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., said Yucca Mountain fights largely have shifted to 
the courts, although utilities could still try to get bills passed allowing 
early nuclear waste shipments to the site. 

"We continue to watch those guys," Porter said. "Members of Congress 
represent their states, and their states want nuclear waste in Nevada." 

Members on the Energy and Commerce Committee have some of the broadest 
responsibilities on Capitol Hill. The panel considers major 
telecommunications matters, health care, consumer protection and product 
liability bills and environmental pollution in addition to energy 
development. 

Brian O'Connell, an executive with the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners, said Barton now would have much more on his plate than 
nuclear waste. 

"You could argue he'll be able to pay less attention to any individual thing 
because he will be juggling a broader agenda," O'Connell said. 

And, he said, for the most part nuclear waste has diminished as a big issue 
since Congress finalized the Yucca Mountain pick in 2002. 

"For average members of Congress, many of them have the sense that this has 
all been decided," O'Connell said. "The rest is just implementation as far as 
they're concerned." 

Electric utilities are Barton's largest financial backers, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors congressional campaign 
finances. 

Among industry contributors during the current election cycle, TXU Corp., a 
Texas utility that operates the Comanche Peak nuclear stations, has donated 
$10,250 to the lawmaker. Exelon Corp., the largest nuclear utility, gave 
$5,000 while American Electric Power gave $4,000. 

"A lot of the large supporters of Barton are firmly committed to the 
expansion of coal and nuclear power. You will see continued support of more 
subsidies to the nuclear power industry," said Tyson Chandler, research 
director of the Critical Mass Energy and Environment Project. 

Lobbyists said they were eager to see who replaces Barton as chairman of the 
energy and air quality subcommittee, which is where nuclear waste bills get 
their initial airing. 

Chandler said it probably wouldn't make a difference. 

"I seriously doubt that he would allow the chairmanship of that subcommittee 
to go to someone who doesn't share his position on Yucca Mountain," he said.

Lab may become nuclear giant
Increase in plutonium work could turn arsenal into world's sixth largest
Article Last Updated: Saturday, February 21, 2004 - 7:34:59 AM PST 
By Ian Hoffman, STAFF WRITER

LIVERMORE -- More than a decade after the end of the Cold War, the federal 
government is weighing a doubling of plutonium work at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory with new capabilities to extract plutonium with exotic 
lasers and research into robotic manufacturing of plutonium fission cores for 
nuclear weapons. 

Unlike its sister design lab, Los Alamos in New Mexico, Livermore is unable 
to separate large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium or fashion the heavy, 
gray metal into a "pit," the hollow, grapefruit-size orbs at the heart of the 
miniature atomic bombs used as a first stage in thermonuclear weapons. 

If Livermore takes on those jobs over the next decade, the lab's storage 
limit for plutonium would double, rising to more than 1.5 tons, according to 
a new environmental analysis released Friday by the National Nuclear Security 
Administration, the weapons arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. 

Fully converting that amount of plutonium, plus the lab's store of highly 
enriched uranium into nuclear weapons would turn Livermore into the world's 
sixth-largest nuclear power, with an arsenal matching that of France. 

In its 2,500-page tome, the government examines all of Livermore's operations 
for the next decade and their impacts on human and environmental health. 

The National Nuclear Security Administration also is considering up to a 
tenfold increase in the lab's day-to-day work with tritium, a radioactive 
form of hydrogen used for thermonuclear weapons and fusion research. 

Scientists would use the gas chiefly for filling tiny metal or plastic 
spheres for use as targets for fusion experiments. They also would need the 
tritium for instruments used in evaluating explosive nuclear tests, in the 
event the president ended the 12-year moratorium on testing. 

Federal authorities say all these capabilities now are essential for 
maintaining the nation's existing nuclear arsenal and for meeting a Bush 
administration nuclear policy that calls for new thermonuclear weapons. 

"It's all for certification," said Thomas Grim, head of the environmental 
analysis, referring to the annual process in which executives of the weapons 
design labs and defense officials guarantee the operability of the U.S. 
nuclear arsenal to the president. 

Pressed for details, Grim and others demurred. A draft of the new sitewide 
environmental impact statement says detailed rationales are contained in 
classified documents. 

Scientists stressed that studying modern, robotic methods of making plutonium 
pits won't turn Livermore into a nuclear bomb factory. Instead, the lab would 
be honing methods for use in a new bomb-making plant, the Modern Pit 
Facility, proposed for location in Texas, New Mexico or South Carolina. 

"We're going to look at technologies that minimize worker dose (from 
plutonium exposure), to minimize the plutonium in casting and to minimize our 
footprint," said Gordon Gueterberg, a former weapons program manager who 
helped analyze the new plans. 

Eventually, he said, "We would pick out one of the (existing) pit designs and 
make a couple of them." 

Proponents of nuclear disarmament said they were shocked by the proposed 
boost in Livermore's plutonium inventory and troubled by the increase in 
tritium work. 

"This is all about more nuclear weapons, more nuclear materials, less 
civilian science and more risk to workers and the community," said Marylia 
Kelley, executive director of a Livermore-based watchdog group, Tri-Valley 
CAREs. "That's headed in the absolute wrong direction." 

Much of the lab's risk to its neighbors has come in the form of tritium. It 
is considerably more radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and the gas 
escapes so easily that incidental releases are almost unavoidable. The lab 
also had two large accidental releases during the Cold War. 

"It's an atrocious record," Kelley said. 

During the 1990s, Livermore's work with tritium, and its releases, declined 
dramatically. Kelley expects to see increased releases, and that's what 
federal officials foresee as well. Their environmental analysis shows a 
tenfold increase in radiation exposure to people living close to the lab's 
fence line, almost all of the increased risk from tritium. 

The government's estimate of the actual risk, however, is quite low, about a 
third of a millirem a year. Average annual radiation dose to Americans is 
about 300 millirems a year, from airline flights, medical and dental X-rays 
and natural sources such as food. 

The new environmental analysis also estimates the risk of fires or an 
airplane attack releasing plutonium from the lab's plutonium facility as low. 
The report says the worst such event would cause no more than two cancer 
deaths for Bay Area civilians over the following 70 years. 

The document is available at the Livermore Public Library and at the lab's 
Discovery Center. A public comment period runs Feb. 27 to May 27. A final 
decision is expected in January 2005. 

In the new analysis, the NNSA proposes a first-ever plutonium-separation 
factory, on a small scale, using a highly sophisticated process known as 
plutonium atomic vapor laser isotopic separation, or Pu-AVLIS. 

It requires vaporizing molten plutonium with an electron beam, then teasing 
apart its different isotopes using tunable dye lasers, which in turn are 
powered or driven by other lasers. 

The laser separation technique could be useful for acquiring "supergrade" 
levels of plutonium-239, the isotope used in weapons. But it also could 
produce quantities of plutonium-238, used to make batteries for spacecraft 
and undersea instruments, and plutonium-242, which behaves like weapons grade 
plutonium in explosive experiments but does not produce a chain reaction.

AEP sells share of South Texas Project
Associated Press
DALLAS - A subsidiary of American Electric Power has agreed to sell its 25.2 
percent stake in the South Texas Project nuclear plant to a unit of Cameco 
Corp. for $332.6 million.

Columbus, Ohio-based AEP had valued the share at about $1.5 billion as 
recently as Dec. 31.

The company said Monday it would ask the Texas Public Utility Commission to 
recover the difference of nearly $1.2 billion from customers of its Texas 
Central Co. subsidiary, formerly known as Central Power and Light.

In effect, AEP claims it could not recover the full cost of its investment in 
the nuclear plant after Texas deregulated its electric market. The state 
deregulation law allowed utilities to recover such costs.

The South Texas Project is a 2,500-megawatt reactor in Matagorda County, 
about 90 miles southwest of Houston. The share held by AEP subsidiary Texas 
Central Co. is about 630 megawatts.

The plant's other owners include Texas Genco, at 30.8 percent; San Antonio 
City Public Service Board, 28 percent; and Austin Energy, 16 percent.

The other owners have the right of first refusal before AEP can sell its 
share to Cameco South Texas Project LP. The deal is also subject to 
regulatory approval.

If none of the owners intervenes, AEP said, the sale would close in the 
second half of this year.

AEP announced in late 2002 that it planned to sell all the generation assets 
owned by Texas Central Co. A bidding process began in June 2003.

Meliss McHenry, a spokeswoman for AEP, said the company would ask the Texas 
PUC to raise Texas Central Co.'s transmission and distribution rates to 
recover the difference between the reactor's sales price and its book value.

The difference, now nearly $1.2 billion, could rise or fall depending on the 
price that AEP gets for other power-generation facilities in Texas, McHenry 
said. She said the company has not estimated the final amount it will seek 
from electric customers in the state.

AEP has nearly 5 million electric customers in 11 states.

Defect shutters unit
Third incident in month plagues Palo Verde plant
Max Jarman
The Arizona Republic
Mar. 3, 2004 12:00 AM


A metal alloy with known structural defects is being blamed for a radiation 
leak Sunday that shut down Unit 3, one of three units at Palo Verde Nuclear 
Generating Station, 50 miles west of Phoenix. 

It was the third leak of radioactive material at the plant in a month. 

The second leak, on Feb. 19, prompted a special investigation by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. Regulators are concerned about several unexpected 
problems that occurred while the leak inside the unit's steam generator was 
being repaired. The first leak, on Feb. 4, involved a valve on a bleed line 
on Unit 1's reactor cooling system. 

Victor Dricks, a spokesman for the NRC, said the three incidents are 
unrelated and don't reflect underlying maintenance or safety problems at the 
plant. 

"Overall, they have an excellent operating and safety record," he said. 

A preliminary inspection has concluded Sunday's leak was caused by stress 
corrosion cracking, the same phenomenon that caused the Kinder Morgan 
gasoline pipeline rupture in July.

James M. Levine, Arizona Public Service Co. executive vice president in 
charge of generation, explained that Iconel 600, a nickel alloy used to make 
the heater sleeves and other components inside the plant, has been found to 
be particularly susceptible to stress corrosion cracking. 

Meanwhile, Dricks said the NRC called for an investigation of the Unit 2 leak 
because of several problems encountered during repairs 

Specifically, plugs used to cut off the supply of water to the steam 
generator's heating tubes didn't fit properly, delaying repairs for several 
hours. That caused air to get into the line; the air had to be vented into an 
auxiliary building. 

The air was scrubbed and treated before it was released to the atmosphere, 
Levine said. 

He attributed the ill-fitting plugs to bugs in the two new 800-ton steam 
generators that were installed at Unit 2 during the fall. The two generators 
cost $230 million. 

"You don't expect them, but they occur," he said. 

The tube leak that shut down the plant Feb. 19 was either the result of a 
factory defect or damage caused as the equipment was shipped from Italy and 
slowly brought over land from a port in Mexico. 

The tubes carry water heated to 620 degrees. When the tubes come into contact 
with water inside the steam generator, an explosive burst of steam is 
produced and used to turn electric turbines. 

As for air getting into the cooling system, called the hot reactor water 
system, Levine said it is a normal occurrence. 

Still, Dricks said the NRC wants to make sure that is the case and that the 
air didn't enter the line in some other way. The agency also wants to be sure 
the plant's operator, APS, reacted properly to the ill-fitting plugs and 
subsequent problem with air in the lines. 

"The NRC staff has decided to conduct a special inspection to evaluate the 
adequacy of the APS' response to the situation," Dricks said. 

On Feb. 29, workers found traces of boron on a heater sleeve attached to a 
pressurizer for the unit's reactor cooling system. Boron absorbs neutrons and 
is used to control the rate of nuclear fission inside the reactor. Its 
presence on the heater sleeve indicates a leak of radioactive material. APS 
spokesman Jim McDonald said the radiation was hardly detectable and poses no 
safety risk for the plant's employees or the general public. 

Discussing Iconel 600's tendency toward stress corrosion cracking, Levine 
said, "We're aware of the problem, and we look for it." 

Dricks said that the NRC also is aware of the problems with Iconel 600 and 
has mandated that plant operators regularly test components made of it.

"It's a common phenomenon and generally does not pose a safety concern," he 
added. 

Evidence of stress corrosion cracking was found on another Unit 3 heater 
sleeve during a refueling outage last spring and on several sleeves in Unit 2 
when its two steam generators were replaced in the fall. Affected components 
in the new steam generators, including about 13,000 tubes that carry water 
heated by the unit's reactor, are made of more durable Iconel 690. While the 
800-ton generators were being installed, Levine said APS went through the 
unit and replaced all of the Iconel 600 parts with those made of Iconel 690. 

While the recent leak was minor, stress corrosion cracking was blamed for a 
1993 heating tube rupture inside Unit 2 that dumped 100 gallons of 
radioactive water per minute into the reactor's steam generator and was 
vented into the atmosphere. 

Dricks said stress corrosion cracking of components made of Iconel 600 has 
been blamed for recent leaks at the South Texas Project near Houston and at 
Seabrook Station in New Hampshire. 

The NRC suggests that particularly damaged components be replaced, but has 
not required that Iconel 600 components be replaced industrywide. 

APS' Levine said the leaking Unit 3 heater sleeve will be repaired, but not 
replaced until 2007 when new steam generators will be installed. Iconel 600 
components in Unit 1 will be replaced with a new steam generator next year, 
Levine said. Units 1 and 3 also contain heating tubes made of Iconel 600. 

Each of the three units at Palo Verde is capable of generating about 1,300 
megawatts of electricity, enough to light 400,000 homes.

Widow says Tooele toxins killed mate  
By Christopher Smart 
The Salt Lake Tribune 

    When the Tooele newspaper refused to print Alan Vorwaller's obituary, his 
widow saw a conspiracy of silence shrouding a sensitive topic: exposure to 
biological and chemical weapons. 

    But the Tooele Transcript Bulletin's associate publisher, Clayton Dunn, 
feared that running the lengthy piece -- submitted by Bonnie Adamsson-
Vorwaller and blaming Alan's death on such toxins -- would be the equivalent 
of screaming "fire" in a crowded theater. 

    "Her claims were unsubstantiated, and we feel that an obituary is not a 
place to push a political agenda," Dunn said. 

    Besides, he added, Tooele County residents are tired of the hazardous-
zone label applied to their community in news reports on such things as 
Envirocare's radioactive waste facility, the Army's chemical weapons 
incinerator and biological warfare laboratories. 

    Alan Vorwaller, 42, died Feb. 1 of cancer that had spread throughout his 
body. His notarized death certificate from Austin, Texas, lists the cause of 
death as "metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown origin." It also lists a 
related condition of "adult respiratory distress syndrome." 

    But his widow says she knows the origin of his illness: exposure to 
fallout from weapons testing during the 30 years he lived in Tooele. 

    In March 1968, Alan Vorwaller was a first-grader at a Tooele elementary 
school, playing in the snow during recess. The same day about 6,000 sheep 
from two herds were found dead in neighboring Skull Valley after chemical-
weapons testing at the Army's Dugway Proving Ground, 40 miles southwest of 
Tooele. 

    Thirty-two years later, Vorwaller's hip was so riddled with tumors that 
it simply snapped, Adamsson-Vorwaller said. "It's the exposure in Utah that 
caused his death," she said in a telephone interview from Austin, where the 
couple moved 11 years ago. 

    "The doctors don't know which poisons caused it," she conceded. "But it 
follows something called the Hiroshima-Nagasaki pattern where, 20 to 30 years 
later, you get cancer. Before he died, his doctor asked him, 'Where were you 
30 years ago?' " 

    After two or three decades, it is impossible to prove that a specific 
toxin spawned cancer or other illnesses, explained environmentalist Chip 
Ward. His 1999 book, Canaries on the Rim, describes potential hazards faced 
by Tooele County residents since the 1950s, including biological and chemical 
weapons testing at Dugway, as well as above-ground nuclear weapons testing in 
Nevada that ended in 1962. 

    "There isn't a direct link," Ward said. "But you can't flood a room and 
then say the reason people drowned is because they weren't tall enough." 

    In 1995, Ward documented more than 200 people with cancer in Grantsville, 
10 miles northwest of Tooele, after canvassing only half the town of 5,000. 
That nonscientific survey equates to eight out of every 100 residents with 
cancer. 

    Despite such data, Vorwaller's father, Donald Vorwaller, disagrees with 
his daughter-in-law's assertion. The senior Vorwaller worked at the Tooele 
Army Depot for more than 25 years and has not experienced any ill effects. 

    "She's politicizing his illness and his death," said Donald Vorwaller 
after reading the obituary this week in Provo's Daily Herald. "All he did was 
grow up here. He didn't work at Dugway or the depot. But it makes it look 
like he worked in the midst of it, and that couldn't be further from the 
truth." 

    However, Beverly White, a former state legislator from Tooele, says 
residents are leery of discussing the health hazards that exist in the west 
desert. It's part of the "conspiracy of silence," she noted. 

    White represents 250 former Dugway workers who suffer from cancer, 
multiple sclerosis, and heart and lung ailments. They have unsuccessfully 
sought compensation from the federal government. 

    "I believe every bit of it," White said of Adamsson-Vorwaller's 
allegations. "It happens all the time."

SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Osama bin Laden's terror
network claims to have bought ready-made nuclear
weapons on the black market in central Asia, the
biographer of al-Qaida's No. 2 leader was quoted
as telling an Australian television station.

In an interview scheduled to be televised on
Monday, Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir said Ayman
al-Zawahri claimed that ``smart briefcase bombs''
were available on the black market.

It was not clear when the interview between Mir
and al-Zawahri took place.

U.S. intelligence agencies have long believed that
al-Qaida attempted to acquire a nuclear device on
the black market, but say there is no evidence it
was successful.

In the interview with Australian Broadcasting
Corp. television, parts of which were released
Sunday, Mir recalled telling al-Zawahri it was
difficult to believe that al-Qaida had nuclear
weapons when the terror network didn't have the
equipment to maintain or use them.

``Dr Ayman al-Zawahri laughed and he said `Mr.
Mir, if you have $30 million, go to the black
market in central Asia, contact any disgruntled
Soviet scientist, and a lot of ... smart briefcase
bombs are available,''' Mir said in the interview.

``They have contacted us, we sent our people to
Moscow, to Tashkent, to other central Asian states
and they negotiated, and we purchased some
suitcase bombs,'' Mir quoted al-Zawahri as saying.

Al-Qaida has never hidden its interest in
acquiring nuclear weapons.

The U.S. federal indictment of bin Laden charges
that as far back as 1992 he ``and others known and
unknown, made efforts to obtain the components of
nuclear weapons.''

Bin Laden, in a November 2001 interview with a
Pakistani journalist, boasted having hidden such
components ``as a deterrent.'' And in 1998, a
Russian nuclear weapons design expert was
investigated for allegedly working with bin
Laden's Taliban allies.

It was revealed last month that Pakistan's top
nuclear scientist had sold sensitive equipment and
nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea,
fueling fears the information could have also
fallen into the hands of terrorists.

Earlier, Mir told Australian media that al-Zawahri
also claimed to have visited Australia to recruit
militants and collect funds.

``In those days, in early 1996, he was on a
mission to organize his network all over the
world,'' Mir was quoted as saying. ``He told me he
stopped for a while in Darwin (in northern
Australia), he was ... looking for help and
collecting funds.''

Australia's Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said
the government could not rule out the possibility
that al-Zawahri visited Australia in the 1990s
under a different name.

``Under his own name or any known alias he hasn't
traveled to Australia,'' Ruddock told reporters
Saturday. ``That doesn't mean to say that he may
not have come under some other false
documentation, or some other alias that's not
known to us.''

Mir describe al-Zawahri as ``the real brain behind
Osama bin Laden.''

``He is the real strategist, Osama bin Laden is
only a front man,'' Mir was quoted as saying
during the interview. ``I think he is more
dangerous than bin Laden.''

Al-Zawahri -- an Egyptian surgeon -- is believed
to be hiding in the rugged region around the
Pakistan-Afghan border where U.S. and Pakistani
troops are conducting a major operation against
Taliban and al-Qaida forces.

He is said to have played a leading role in
orchestrating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the
United States.

Naked City
UT's Eyes on Los Alamos

[graphic here]
State Rep. Lon Burnam of Fort Worth speaks out against UT's bid for control 
of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Is the UT System learning to love the bomb? In February, the UT Board of 
Regents announced a possible bid for management of New Mexico's Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, best known as the birthplace of the A-bomb and more 
recently for a litany of security mishaps, production of new nuclear bombs, 
and research into low-yield "mini-nukes." 

For over 60 years the University of California System has managed Los Alamos 
under an arrangement with what is now the U.S. Department of Energy. But 
provoked by what he calls "systemic management failure" at Los Alamos that he 
blames on UC, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham decided last year to open 
Los Alamos to competitive bidding. Other universities and private defense 
companies can smell blood, and many UT leaders believe the university is 
particularly well positioned to win management of Los Alamos, though system 
officials stress they still do not know if they will actually submit a bid. 
The UT regents have authorized spending up to $500,000 "for planning related 
to a potential bid for the Los Alamos contract." By November, they will 
announce whether UT will pursue the bid. The DOE will announce the winning 
bid in late spring 2005. According to UT, the entire process could cost up to 
$6 million. 

UT System Chancellor Mark Yudof has hinted in public statements that UT may 
partner with defense companies to enhance the bid, but system officials also 
note that DOE has yet to indicate what criteria it will be using to evaluate 
contenders. Beyond that, details of the proposal have been too few and far 
between for the liking of some students and faculty, as well as state Rep. 
Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth. "We're calling for some sort of open dialogue so 
dissenting opinion is built into the bidding process," said Colin Leyden, 
Burnam's legislative director. "The UC System is polling their faculty on Los 
Alamos. They are also sponsoring a Web site where debate and white papers are 
posted. We haven't seen that happen with the UT System." After meeting with 
UT Regents Chairman Charles Miller, Burnam said that Miller was amenable to a 
more open process. 

The Los Alamos bid does enjoy some support on UT's flagship campus from 
students and faculty who point both to the financial rewards to the system Ð 
like the $9 million in annual management fees now going to California Ð and 
the opportunities Los Alamos could provide for faculty and graduate student 
researchers. In an editorial in The Daily Texan, outgoing UT Student 
Government President Brian Haley opined that "Through a strategic partnership 
with Los Alamos, the UT System would be able to increase its leadership [and 
bring] enormous prestige to our faculty and researchers." 

But opponents of a partnership Ð particularly members of the activist group 
UT Watch (with which this reporter has worked in the past) Ð argue that, far 
from bringing prestige to UT, management could pose a tremendous liability 
for the university. They cite damning reports from whistle-blowers and 
watchdog groups that Los Alamos has failed to deal with security problems and 
is vulnerable to both internal lapses and outside terrorist threats. In the 
past, they point out, UC has been held responsible for security issues that 
may be impossible for any university to resolve. 

Critics also lament the threat to academic freedom Los Alamos poses. "Forty 
percent of Los Alamos' research is classified. This seriously undermines the 
university's main objective to provide open research and learning," said 
Dominique Cambou, a UT-Austin physics student and member of a coalition 
leading opposition to Los Alamos. "I feel that the cost and the risk of UT's 
management of Los Alamos vastly outweigh any small benefits to the 
university."

The Firing Line
SG blew it

SG tabled and effectively killed AR-1, a bill calling for SG to moderate a 
forum where concerns listed in the resolution about Los Alamos would be 
addressed and debated in the fall. Regardless of where students stand on Los 
Alamos, this bill would have allowed for opinions to be heard and met with 
facts at a forum that even UT administrators endorsed. According to Matt 
Stolhandske, the bill was "politicizing the SG assembly." Umm ... I must be 
missing something, but I always thought government, even Student Government, 
was about politics. Instead of debating and amending the bill, which UT Watch 
repeatedly said it was open to doing, SG didn't even do that and shut down an 
opportunity for discussion. SG members who thought that the bill was "biased" 
had numerous opportunities to work on the bill and "unbias" it. UT Watch came 
to them day after day, not the other way around. We were the ones interested 
in compromise, while certain SG members, who are acting as proxies of the 
administration, shut down a chance to even debate what concerned students 
spent days working on.

Currently the University of California System has been holding forums at UC 
campuses on this very issue. I don't think it would have been jumping the gun 
to call for a forum at UT-Austin in the fall. This was a chance for SG to be 
proactive in addressing one of the biggest issues of the next school year in 
a balanced way. They blew it.

Group: Radioactivity high near lab
By Sophia KazmiBy Sophia Kazmi
CONTRA COSTA TIMES

A scientific watchdog group's study of areas near Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratory has found heightened levels of radioactivity.

The levels found are no danger to public health, say members of the watchdog 
group, as do lab officials, who say that the lab has a fine monitoring system.

The fact that radioactive elements were found in water, air and soil samples 
is a concern, said Norm Buske of The RadioActivist Campaign, based in 
Belfair, Wash.

"It's not a flee-for-your-life" situation, "but it does call for community 
education, organization and involvement," said Buske, who said the lab needs 
to re-evaluate its monitoring program.

TRAC began in December, taking samples from Arroyo Seco, Arroyo Las Positas 
and areas downwind of the lab, said Buske.

Results from tests, which are expected to be complete in September, indicate 
four radioactive elements have been found near the lab: americium-241, cesium-
137 strontium-90 and iron-59. Americium is a byproduct of plutonium 
production. Cesium and strontium are byproducts of fission, the process of 
splitting of an atom.

The most surprising sample was from grass taken near Flynn Road, which 
reportedly had strontium-90 at about 20 times above recommended levels.

Buske calls the lab's monitoring program "fundamentally faulty" and says it 
needs to be redone to detect any escaping radioactivity and to report those 
figures to the public for future reference. So far, though, the Livermore lab 
has fared better than the 26 other nuclear weapons facilities, such as Los 
Alamos, that TRAC has surveyed here and abroad, he said.

Bert Heffner, the lab's manager of environmental community relations, said 
the reference the group's report uses is for ground water. Because "most 
people don't drink grass," the report should be using U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration figures, which are well above the recorded levels.

Heffner said the lab has an extensive monitoring program from Tracy to 
Pleasanton that exceeds governmental requirements for testing water, air and 
soil samples. It has 14 air monitoring stations, he said.

"We will test 25,000 samples annually," he said. "We think we have a very 
strong, very good and very protective program."

The lab is also monitored by the U.S. Department of Energy and California 
Department of Health Services, which was unaware of the independent study. A 
state representative said Wednesday that the department could not comment 
until it had seen TRAC's report.

TRAC collaborated with Tri-Valley Communities Against a Radioactive 
Environment, a Livermore nuclear watchdog group, which was happy to work with 
TRAC because it was concerned about the lab's monitoring program, said 
Marylia Kelley, executive director of Tri-Valley CAREs.

"We're concerned that there may be holes in the lab's monitoring program," 
she said.

Sale set for interest in Waste Control Specialists
The company wants to open a radioactive disposal facility in Andrews.
By Ruth Friedberg Campbell
Odessa American

A public sale will be conducted Friday on a 10 percent interest in Waste 
Control Specialists, the company that wants to open a low-level radioactive 
disposal facility in western Andrews County.
KNB Holdings Ltd. has a 10 percent minority interest in Waste Control 
Specialists. The 10 percent interest was secured by notes from KNB to Waste 
Control, said Tony Proffitt, spokesman for Waste Control Specialists.
"WCS is exercising its right to foreclose on the collateral (a note that 
secured the 10 percent minority interest). The effect is that the foreclosure 
and the sale will remove KNB from any ownership interest in WCS," Proffitt 
said.
Waste Control will likely buy back the interest, but theoretically anyone 
could purchase it, Proffitt said.
The sale is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Friday at Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ 
Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas, 75240 ÑWaste Control's office.
Proffitt said the interest is being sold through public sale because that's 
the way it's spelled out under the Texas Uniform Commercial Code. "This 
situation is like a 10-year old deal," he said.
Proffitt said attorneys for Waste Control and lawyers for KNB are "still 
trying to resolve the issues on the foreclosure. If they're resolved, then 
the sale could be canceled."
He said the sale does not affect any of Waste Control's plans. The company 
currently operates a low-level radioactive storage facility.
Texas lawmakers passed legislation this past session allowing a private 
entity to get a license to dispose of low-level radioactive waste.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will start taking proposals 
from interested companies in July, agency spokeswoman Adria Dawidczik said.
Waste Control plans to dig 
an initial 1,500-square-foot concrete-lined hole that is 75 feet deep. Right 
below the surface is 800 feet of clay, although there has been some debate 
over whether the site is over an aquifer.
There are also monitor wells around the site and sump pumps that pump water 
into a holding well when it rains.
The pit would hold 6 million cubic yards of waste. Only 600,000 cubic yards 
of waste would have high levels of radioactivity.

Savannah River Site Waits For Word On $4 Billion Plant
Report To Congress Due In Coming Weeks

POSTED: 1:44 pm EDT May 11, 2004
UPDATED: 2:06 pm EDT May 11, 2004

AIKEN, S.C. -- The Savannah River Site near Aiken could soon find out soon if 
it's in line for a $4 billion plant.

Linton Brooks with the National Nuclear Security Administration said a report 
about the nation's nuclear stockpile will be given to Congress within weeks.

Officials delayed locating the plutonium trigger production plant until the 
agency outlined current and future conditions of the country's nuclear 
arsenal. 

Other sites being considered for the plant are near Amarillo, Texas, the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory and Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, both in New 
Mexico, and the Nevada Test Site.

Brooks said officials must determine how much material they have, before they 
decided when and where to build a new plant.

The plant would build plutonium pits used to detonate nuclear weapons. The 
SRS currently employs about 13,000 workers.

Unwelcome Welcome:
A nuclear consortium has the NRC's green light, regardless of New Mexicans'
objections
By Amy Williams
Albuquerque Tribune
May 27, 2004

The idea that a financially troubled, foreign, nuclear consortium whose
members have a deplorable environmental past, whose technology has shown up
in the hands of terrorist nations, and which has been roundly rejected by
citizens of two other U.S. states, would get a free pass to build a uranium
enrichment facility in New Mexico seems implausible in this enlightened age,
right? Maybe not.

At least not if the staff of our own federal agency, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), has its way.  Earlier this month, staff attorneys for the
NRC
recommended against allowing the citizens of New Mexico - through our state
Attorney General's office and Environment Department - to raise these and
other concerns regarding a proposed uranium enrichment facility to be built
in Lea County by the foreign consortium Urenco. Not to be outdone, Urenco
itself asked the agency to rule against allowing two citizens' groups, who
represent their members living near the facility, to raise similar concerns
in a formal process, called an intervention, provided for under federal law.

How can this be?  Apparently, the NRC has such an awesome 'say-so' over all
things nuclear that even our own Governor - who, as former U.S. Energy
Secretary is an authority on such matters - cannot get a hearing on issues
regarding the health and safety of New Mexicans.  Apparently the NRC staff,
most of whom reside in and around Washington, D.C., are more interested in
licensing these facilities than the concerns of those of us who eat, drink
and breathe in proximity to them.

Case in point:  If the NRC staff has its way, Urenco will be allowed to
build a facility in the Land of Enchantment that will, over 30 years, create
a mountain of radioactive waste that no facility in this country - in
existence or even on the drawing boards - is licensed to accept.  The NRC
would also dismiss the question of whether the consortium would even be
financially capable of safely dealing with the waste in light of published
reports, including a London Observer article, that one of the consortium
members, British Nuclear Fuels, Ltd (BNFL), is teetering on the verge of
bankruptcy.  This is nothing to take lightly given that BNFL is the proud
owner of the Sellafield nuclear facility in the United Kingdom, which
remains operational and continues to create a toxic mess that will require
cleanup well into the future.

Also on the NRC's cutting room floor are concerns about groundwater
contamination and security. Groundwater contamination has plagued the host
city of a similar facility in Paducah, Kentucky.  Moreover, widely published
reports, including an article in Time Magazine, indicate Urenco's
security is so bad they have supplied nuclear technology to an A-list
of terrorist states, including North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan.

Former House Speaker Tip O'Neill once said that "all politics is local."
During the past ten years, the citizens of Louisiana, followed by those of
Tennessee, proved this adage true by insisting on answers to some of these
same questions when Urenco proposed to build this facility in their states.
Hearing none, they sent the company and the federal agency packing.  It is
time for all New Mexicans to either get the respect and the answers we
deserve - or do the same.

Williams is a coordinator with Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety of
Santa Fe.  She wrote this column for the New Mexico Editorial Forum.

Kleberg County residents: Water unsafe
But uranium company says mining doesn't harm the environment

By QUINCY C. COLLINS Caller-Times
June 21, 2004

KINGSVILLE Ñ To protect South Texas drinking water, Kleberg County 
commissioners and a grassroots environmental group are suing the state's 
leading environmental and health agencies. 

County officials and some residents are afraid loopholes in a recent 
groundwater restoration agreement between the state and a uranium mining 
company could allow contamination of the region's largest groundwater source. 
 
Uranium Resource Inc., a Dallas-based in-situ mining company, operates 
Kingsville Dome, the uranium mine near Ricardo that sparked the standoff 
between the county and the state. 

For Teo Saenz, whose family lives in Garcia Hills, a 240-acre plot next to a 
uranium production well at URI's Kingsville Dome, the dispute over 
groundwater restoration is a fight to protect his family and neighbors. 

Saenz helped organize South Texas Opposes Pollution in 1988 when URI began 
mining in the area. At least 20 Garcia Hills residents and family members 
drink from private water wells, he said, and they fear the water they depend 
on is already contaminated. 

"They are scared to death to drink the water," Saenz said. 

Uranium mining company executives at the center of the dispute say the 
lawsuit is part of a fear campaign. They say the agreement is in the state's 
best interest. And they say their adversaries lack proof. 

"There are people in the county who are anti-nuclear and say 'not my 
backyard,' " said Richard Van Horn, URI senior vice president for 
operations. "Not once have our detractors come up with evidence that we have 
impacted the environment." 

Uranium is a radioactive mineral used primarily by the nuclear power industry 
to produce energy. In-situ uranium mining is a process in which a water, 
sodium bicarbonate-carbonate and oxygen solution is pumped through injection 
wells to dislodge uranium naturally occurring in the rock lining of 
freshwater aquifers. 

Mining waters are contained through a pressure sink in the well fields and 
monitoring devices are used to detect mining byproduct leaks. 

Mining experts consider the in-situ process to be cleaner and safer than pit 
and underground mining. Groundwater restoration is completed after the mine 
is terminated. Injected chemicals or substances produced during mining 
include tailings, or trace amounts of uranium, and must be removed or 
immobilized. The aquifer must be returned to water quality standards defined 
by the state. 

A March agreement between the company, Texas Commission on Environmental 
Quality, Texas Department of Health and an insurance carrier allows URI to 
continue mining without posting financial assurance for groundwater 
restoration costs. 

The agreement allows the company to fund groundwater restoration and cleanup 
efforts with profits made from mining operations from another site in Duval 
County. 

Kleberg County officials contest the agreement because it allows the company 
to start mining again without putting funds into bonds to assure groundwater 
restoration and cleanup. 

County commissioners and STOP members want URI to abide by the state's 
requirement to acquire bonds and promptly restore the community's groundwater 
quality. 

"We're not fighting the state agencies just to be difficult, but to hold them 
responsible for overseeing the public health and welfare to which they were 
entrusted," said Kleberg County Commissioner David Rosse. "We have a 
responsibility to our constituents to provide a safe environment for them and 
their children." 

Since the late 1980s, URI has operated one Kleberg County site and two Duval 
County mining sites along the Goliad Sand, a band of the Evangeline Aquifer 
of the Gulf Coast Aquifer system stretching from Lavaca County to Starr and 
Hidalgo counties. It fans across the Coastal Bend to the Gulf of Mexico and 
is pumped extensively. 

URI's mining operations in Duval and Kleberg counties are inspected monthly 
and there are no current reports or complaints of contamination in the 
groundwater surrounding the mining sites, said Terry Clawson, Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman. 

URI froze mining operations from 1990 to 1996 and 1999 to the present because 
of plummeting uranium prices. The company's state permits had no expiration 
date. But in March, the company announced the market turned around and the 
freeze in operations was thawing. 

A January ruling by the 4th Court of Appeals in San Antonio also helped pave 
the way for URI to continue mining in Duval County. The court upheld a lower 
court opinion that contested leases with property owners at Vasquez property 
in Duval County were in full force, even though the company halted mining 
operations. Production at the company's Vasquez site has been authorized 
since September 1999. 

Van Horn said without the groundwater restoration agreement with the state, 
taxpayers may have had to pay for cleanup and restoration. 

In exchange for not forcing URI to acquire bonds for groundwater restoration, 
the agreement holds the company to a groundwater restoration schedule even if 
the company goes out of business, Van Horn said. 

The Vasquez uranium production is sold to utility services and 50 cents for 
every pound of uranium from the Vasquez site goes toward restoring the 
Kingsville Dome and Rosita sites, Van Horn said. He said there is at least 
2.8 million pounds of uranium to be mined at the Vasquez site. 

"The agreement would not have been signed if it wasn't in the best interest 
of the state," Van Horn said. "It is a vehicle to get restoration done. 
Without Vasquez profits, the state picks up the tab." 

Kleberg County officials say the risk of contamination is too great to leave 
balanced on the ebb and flow of the international uranium market. 

"It's disappointing to us that they have failed to show that they could make 
a profit," Rosse said. "There has never been a total, 100-percent cleanup 
back to baseline levels. All we are asking is, make us whole again." 

Mining operations at Vasquez property will continue in August, Van Horn said. 
Ground water restoration completion for Kingsville Dome is scheduled for 
August 2007. Groundwater restoration completion for the Rosita site in Duval 
County is scheduled for December 2005. 

"We've had hard times, but now we're back," Van Horn said. "We are regulated. 
We do the job right, and we don't impact the environment." 

In May, the Kleberg County Commissioners Court filed for a temporary 
injunction against the TCEQ and TDH, asking a district judge in Austin to 
order the state to stop its agreement with URI. 

The commissioners allege the state agencies had no authority to make the 
agreement without bringing the issue before the public. 

South Texas Opposes Pollution members joined the county in its lawsuit 
against the state agencies. 

Saenz said URI disregarded safety for profits and the state agencies have 
bent the rules for the company's convenience. 

"They knew the market would not continue at those prices, but they made the 
decision not to put that money aside for cleanup," he said. 

Clawson said the Texas Attorney General's Office, which is handling the 
defense for the agencies, would file a general denial against Kleberg County 
commissioners' and STOP members' claims. 

State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, and state Rep. Juan M. Escobar, D-
Kingsville, have entered the discussions as mediators. 

The region's groundwater must be protected and the state, county and URI must 
compromise without wasting taxpayers' dollars on a lawsuit to defend a mining 
company, Lucio said. 

Lucio, a member of a Senate Committee on Natural Resources, said the 
agreement should have been negotiated with Kleberg County commissioners on 
board. 
"It is beyond my comprehension that a contract such as this agreement did not 
require permission from the local commissioners' court," Lucio said. "It is 
the most precious resource. The future of Kleberg County depends on the 
quality of its water." 

Van Horn said local politicians have used the Kingsville Dome issue as a 
political platform and negotiations and legal mediation have failed. 
"We have tried several times in the past to do arbitration, and we have 
basically been left at the altar," he said. 

In meetings with TCEQ and TDH officials, Kleberg County officials voiced 
their concerns over water quality and asked the state to reconsider the 
groundwater restoration agreement with URI. 

In an April 29 letter to Lucio, TCEQ Deputy Executive Director Glenn Shankle 
said the state would not terminate the agreement and recent testing 
identified "no concerns relevant to continued operation, safety or 
containment." 

Kleberg County officials were not satisfied and they have begun laying the 
groundwork with Lucio and Escobar for new legislation next session to give 
local governments leverage. 

Rosse said county officials would like to see legislation to create a 
groundwater district for the area, disallow mining near potable aquifers or 
return water quality to safe drinking standards, and give local governments 
the authority to contract with mining companies. 

"This is for all of Texas," Rosse said. "We're not self-serving on this 
thing. We are doing this for all of South Texas. Our intent is not to make 
URI go away, but to accomplish the goals which they promised they could do." 

STOP members say that though they have had limited results in reducing URI's 
presence, they are making a difference. 

"We're their conscience," Saenz said. "They know someone is watching."

President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood
swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately
express growing concern over their leaders state of mind.

In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes
from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media,
Democrats and others that he classifies as "enemies of the state."

Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge,
increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a
public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.

"It reminds me of the Nixon days," says a longtime GOP political consultant
with contacts in the White House. "Everybody is an enemy; everybody is out
to get him. That's the mood over there."

In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk
off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged, led
by a man who declares his decisions to be "God's will" and then tells aides
to "fuck" over anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.

"We're at war, there's no doubt about it. What I don't know anymore is just
who the enemy might be," says one troubled White House aide. "We seem to
spend more time trying to destroy John Kerry than al Qaeda and our enemies
list just keeps growing and growing."

Aides say the President gets "hung up on minor details," micromanaging to
the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture. He will spend hours
personally reviewing and approving every attack ad against his Democratic
opponent and then kiss off a meeting on economic issues.

"This is what is killing us on Iraq," one aide says. "We lost focus. The
President got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an
unproven link to al Qaeda. We could have found other justifiable reasons for
the war but the President insisted the focus stay on those two, tenuous
items."

Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to the
President or other top advisors. Among top officials, Bush's inner circle is
shrinking. Secretary of State Colin Powell has fallen out of favor because
of his growing doubts about the administration's war against Iraq.

The President's abrupt dismissal of CIA Directory George Tenet Wednesday
night is, aides say, an example of how he
works.

"Tenet wanted to quit last year but the President got his back up and
wouldn't hear of it," says an aide. "That would have been the opportune time
to make a change, not in the middle of an election campaign but when the
director challenged the President during the
meeting Wednesday, the President cut him off by saying 'that's it George. I
cannot abide disloyalty. I want your resignation and I want
it now."

Tenet was allowed to resign "voluntarily" and Bush informed his shocked
staff of the decision Thursday morning. One aide says the President actually
described the decision as "God's will."

God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the
administrations lightning rod because of his questionable actions that
critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains part
of the power elite. West Wing staffers call
Bush and Ashcroft "the Blues Brothers" because "they're on a mission from
God."

"The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion," says
one aide. "They both believe any action is justifiable in the name
of God."

But the President who says he rules at the behest of God can also
tongue-lash those he perceives as disloyal, calling them "fucking assholes"
in front of other staff, berating one cabinet official in front of others
and labeling anyone who disagrees with him "unpatriotic" or "anti-American."

"The mood here is that were under siege, there's no doubt about it," says
one troubled aide who admits he is looking for work elsewhere. "In this
administration, you don't have to wear a turban or speak Farsi to be an
enemy of the United States. All you have to do is disagree with the
President."

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.

Nuclear weapons dismantling plant's safety under scrutiny
Safety Violations, pollution concern some residents of Amarillo
By BETSY BLANEY
Associated Press

AMARILLO -- It's a peaceful picture of remote Texas Panhandle countryside. 
The amber wheat fields, the grazing cattle, the smattering of farmhouses. 

Then there's the nuclear plant. 

Largely tucked away from public view, technicians work with radioactive and 
explosive materials around the clock at the 25-square-mile Pantex complex -- 
the nation's only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly plant. 

Pantex became part of the landscape over the past 60 years. Built in 1942, 
its initial mission was to load and pack conventional artillery shells and 
bombs for use during World War II. Workers assembled nuclear weapons there 
during the Cold War and then began dismantling them during the 1990s. 

The plant, the fourth-largest employer in the Amarillo area, provides jobs 
for 3,500 workers, with salaries averaging about $50,000. But some of the 
250,000 people living near the plant have become increasingly concerned about 
how Pantex's operations affect public safety and the environment. 

Federal inspectors found two safety violations in the past several months 
that were classified as minor but raise serious questions about employee 
training and procedures. 

In January, technicians used duct tape to secure broken pieces of an 
explosive component to a nuclear warhead. Nothing exploded, and no one was 
hurt. Last fall, technicians taking apart an old warhead accidentally drilled 
into its radioactive core, forcing evacuation of the building. 

If the technicians had dropped the unstable, taped-together explosive, it 
would have set off a "violent reaction," John T. Conway, chairman of the 
National Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, wrote in a letter to Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham. 

The incident was investigated by the board. The review is classified, but a 
report on its findings said "a comprehensive set of corrective actions is 
being developed." 

Jud Simmons, spokesman for Lynchburg, Va.-based BWX Technologies, which 
operates Pantex, said public safety was not at risk. 

"Safe control of all components and materials was maintained at all times," 
Simmons said. "The technicians were working in a safe and professional 
manner. They performed the process as they were trained, and they stopped 
work when appropriate." 

There have been four accidents at Pantex since 1971, resulting in five 
deaths. Three people were killed in 1977 in an explosion when a machine 
malfunctioned. No one died in the most serious accident, in 1989, when 
tritium gas was released during a weapons dismantling. 

Simmons said the plant's safety record has been solid since then. 

"Everyone at the Pantex plant understands the importance of the work we do at 
the site and place an incredibly high value on protecting our employees and 
the public," Simmons said. 

Along with safety, residents fear explosive materials and heavy metals could 
contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer, which lies hundreds of feet beneath the 
plant and is a major water source for much of West Texas. 

The Ogallala is checked quarterly and shows no signs of contamination, said 
Dennis Huddleston, an environmental restoration manager for BWX Technologies. 

"If there's any questionable data, we usually flag it and go out and sample 
again for verification, just to make sure there's nothing there," Huddleston 
said. 

Traces of trichloroethylene, a dangerous chemical used at the plant, have 
been found over the years in the Ogallala, but the amounts were not 
significant, said Adria Dawidczik, spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality. Huddleston said investigators believe the chemical 
made its way to the aquifer through a poorly drilled offsite well not 
operated by the plant. 

Trichloroethylene mainly affects the central nervous system, causing 
headache, confusion, euphoria, facial numbness and weakness, according to the 
Environmental Protection Agency. Liver, kidney, immunological, endocrine and 
developmental effects have also been reported in humans. 

There is a small perched aquifer that provides an effective barrier to the 
Ogallala, Huddleston said. 

In 2000, the plant was cited by the TCEQ for failure to report heavy metals, 
such as trichloroethylene, in the perched aquifer. Plant officials now are 
working with the commission to meet state regulations for contamination 
reporting, Dawidczik said. 

Since the early 1980s, hazardous waste materials generated from plant 
operations are placed in containers and hauled to permitted and licensed 
disposal sites around the state, Huddleston said. Some of the waste is 
incinerated and some is treated to make it less harmful, he said. 

Since 2002, a soil vapor extraction system has withdrawn 10,205 pounds of 
chemicals -- a weight calculated by converting vapors to pounds -- from where 
Pantex used to burn off old explosives, he said. Taking the vaporized 
chemicals from subsurface soils is intended to prevent further groundwater 
contamination. The vapors are treated through a chemical oxidation process 
that renders them harmless, Huddleston said. 

Beverly Gattis, a member of Sustainability in Technologies, Agriculture, and 
Nature's Diversity, a grass-roots environmental group, is skeptical. 

"It's just a matter of time before significant contamination reaches the 
Ogallala," she said. "Now it is just damage control and trying to keep it 
from being as devastating as it would have been without citizens pushing for 
cleanup to be done." 

Concern over the threat of terrorism at Pantex increased in March when a 
report from the Energy Department's internal watchdog said training at the 
plant and nine other nuclear facilities around the country had been reduced 
or eliminated. 

Training for guards had suffered because of overtime demands, according to a 
letter to the department's inspector general from the National Nuclear 
Security Administration. 

The criticisms were the latest leveled against the government's ability to 
protect nuclear facilities, long considered prime targets for espionage and 
terrorist attacks. 

Simmons, the company spokesman, called the security system at the 
plant "world class" but said he could not discuss details. "We constantly 
protect and defend for a wide variety of potential threats," he said. 

Amarillo Mayor Trent Sizemore said he understands residents' concerns, but he 
believes the plant is a "valuable corporate citizen," an important "asset to 
not only this region but to the defense and safety of this nation." 

"I sleep very comfortably at night because I live and interact with the 
people who work on those very weapons," he said. "I believe them to be very 
competent and highly skilled and my trust is in them."

GeoMelt solidifies its presence
By Tracy Hayhurst
 
A heap of radioactive or other hazardous waste can be reduced to a harmless, 
shiny glass lump with blasts from patented technologies, according to 
GeoMelt, 
the firm that owns the process.

GeoMelt technologies are the patented property of the Battelle Memorial 
Institute of Columbus, Ohio. AMEC Earth & Environmental in Richland, Wash., 
has an 
exclusive agreement to develop and market the processes.

AMEC, the British parent firm of the environmental group, took over the 
license for the vitrification technology from GeoSafe Corp. in 2000. Battelle 
created GeoSafe to take the technology commercial, said Leo Thompson, 
division 
manager for GeoMelt.

The vitrification process uses an electric current, delivered via graphite 
electrodes inserted into the contaminated waste, to heat the material to 
between 
2,552¡F and 3,632¡F. This can be done in the ground in what is known as in 
situ vitrification, or it can be done in a container that then acts as the 
shipping and disposal box.

As the molten zone grows, it incorporates hazardous inorganic elements in it, 
while the high temperature destroys organics through pyrolysis and catalytic 
reactions, the company said.

The process can be skid- or trailer-mounted and transported by truck to a 
work site. Separate units that capture off-gasses with scrubbers and filters 
are 
part of the setup, Thompson said, and sometimes contaminated clothes or other 
materials used during the process can be melted with a subsequent batch.

Each melt is different, but with in-ground vitrification, GeoMelt can handle 
up to 1,000 tons of material per batch. The waste, dirt and refractory 
materials are heated over the course of a week or two, with the molten mass 
being 
monitored and then allowed to cool, Thompson said. In-container melts, which 
are 
more common, take less time.

Compared to other thermal treatments, such as plasma or rotary kilns, GeoMelt 
does not require additives. It also has the largest available scale and 
processing rate, and lower capital costs because it doesn«t use a complex 
melter 
vessel, the company said.

At the U.S. Department of Energy«s Hanford site in southeastern Washington 
state, the government is building a large vitrification plant, with 
completion 
planned for 2011, to handle that site«s high-level radioactive waste. 
Supplemental treatment technologies, including GeoMelt, are being considered 
to handle 
the low-level waste, Hanford spokesman Erik Olds said.

"It«s amazing, it«s quite simple," he said of the GeoMelt process. The 
material treated by GeoMelt would be disposed of somewhere on the Hanford 
site, 
while the high-level radioactive material eventually will be shipped to a 
national 
repository, perhaps Yucca Mountain in Nevada, Olds said.

In western Texas, GeoMelt and a waste company are running two demonstration 
projects and building a plant to treat DOE waste from Rocky Flats, Colo., and 
Oak Ridge, Tenn., which is being stored at the disposal site, Thompson said.

In March, the DOE scrapped plans to use GeoMelt to clean nuclear waste at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, over cost concerns. The government 
instead plans to use concrete to stabilize trenches filled with nuclear waste.

Conference on uranium-enrichment plant ends
Odessa American- Jun 17, 2004

HOBBS, N.M. Ñ A pre-hearing conference on a proposed uranium enrichment plant 
near Eunice has ended with a suggestion to the parties that they work out 
issues where there is some agreement.
The event was conducted Tuesday by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board at 
the Lea County Event Center in Hobbs. It had been scheduled to continue into 
Wednesday, but everything was wrapped up Tuesday, said Scott Burnell, public 
affairs officer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Louisiana Energy Services, a consortium of energy companies, proposes 
spending $1.2 billion on the proposed plant called the National Enrichment 
Facility.
The New Mexico Environment Department, New Mexico attorney general, Nuclear 
Information and Resource Service and Public Citizen want to participate in a 
future mandatory hearing on the plant. The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board 
has until July 19 to decide which contentions it views as valid.
After that, Burnell said the board will schedule a mandatory hearing.
Nuclear Information and Resource Service raised the possibility that runoff 
could possibly carry contamination from waste storage cylinders to 
groundwater, Burnell said.
The Washington, D.C.-based organization also said the plant would put a 
higher demand on the local aquifer. But LES said its projected usage would 
not impact the aquifer, Burnell said.
The panel also suggested further analysis of possible accidents at the 
natural gas transmission facility near the proposed plant, Burnell said.
Among the other concerns covered during the hearing were the economic 
viability of the plant, the question of where and how the spent nuclear waste 
will be disposed of and whether LES will have the money to pay to 
decommission the plant after its proposed 30-year lifespan.

NRC hears comments about proposed factory near Eunice 
Last Update: 06/16/2004 8:28:30 AM
By: Associated Press
(Hobbs-AP) -- Attorneys for the state and for activist groups want to know 
how a company planning to build a uranium enrichment factory near Eunice 
would dispose of its radioactive waste.

A three-person panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a hearing in 
Hobbs Tuesday as part of the license application process by Louisiana Energy 
Services.

State officials worry that without a plan for long-term disposal, New Mexico 
might get stuck with the waste after the factory's 30-year life span ends.

An attorney for the state Environment Department, Tannis Fox, says the 
company has not proposed a plausible strategy for the disposal of depleted 
uranium.

A company attorney says the waste plans are sufficient for the NRC to grant a 
license for the factory.

LES Press Release


LES Reaffirms Commitment to State Participation in Licensing Process 
    Hobbs, N.M., June 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Louisiana Energy Services (LES) today
reaffirmed its support for the State of New Mexico to have status as
interveners before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) impaneled by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  The ASLB held a Pre-hearing
Conference in Hobbs, New Mexico today.
    "We continue to believe that the state of New Mexico, through the Attorney
General and New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), should be the
representative of the people of this state throughout this process.  Today's
discussions, enabled the Licensing Board to proceed to their final decision on
what issues they allow into the formal proceedings," said Marshall Cohen, LES
Vice President of Communications and Government Relations.  "Notwithstanding
that decision, we also look forward to discussions with the State either in or
outside of the NRC hearing process on the various issues raised," added Cohen.
    The Pre-hearing Conference allowed the ASLB that has been impaneled by the
NRC for the National Enrichment Facility (NEF), to hear from attorneys
representing the interveners regarding the contentions they have raised, and
allowed lawyers for the NRC staff and LES to comment.  The ASLB proceedings
did not have substantive discussions or arguments about the project; only
procedural issues will be considered.
    "While LES has opposed the inclusion of some contentions that were already
resolved in the NRC Order of February 6, 2003 or fall outside the scope of the
licensing process, we have committed, since day one, to have an open
discussion about this facility and to answer questions raised by the state and
the public," Cohen stated.
    Final decisions on all contentions that will be admitted by the ASLB are
anticipated by July 19, 2004.
    The NEF will provide more than 200 permanent jobs and 400 to 800 multi-
year construction jobs in Southeast New Mexico.  It will use a proven
technology that has operated safely in Europe for 30 years.  NEF expects that
the facility by product will be treated by a new privately operated
deconversion facility, and be safely disposed of following that treatment.
LES is now in discussions with three companies possessing deconversion
technology, looking to have an agreement with one of those companies by the
time the NEF is licensed.

    LES is a partnership of major nuclear energy companies.  Partners include
Urenco, Westinghouse and U.S. energy companies Duke Power, Entergy and Exelon.

Waste Control Specialists handles all kinds of items
By Ruth Friedberg Campbell
Odessa American

ANDREWS COUNTY Ñ From tainted fluorescent light bulbs to "hot" pieces of 
forklifts, Waste Control Specialists gets a variety of items at its low-level 
radioactive storage site. 
Waste Control Specialists receives, treats and stores low-level waste, but 
can't dispose of it Ñ something it is trying to get approval for from the 
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said Tom W. Jones III, general 
manager.
If Waste Control's license is approved, the company would be able to start 
taking waste in 2008. Jones said the company cannot build the disposal site 
until it has a license. 
However, the disposal facility will be designed beforehand.
Jones said construction of the estimated $12 million project would take nine 
months to a year once contracts are awarded.
The way the disposal site legislation is written, it would include one 
facility for the interstate Waste Compact, including Texas, Vermont and 
Maine. However, Jones said Maine may be dropping out.
There would be a second facility for government waste, which would mainly 
include contaminated soil. However, both sites would get demolition debris, 
lab coats, respirators, coveralls and gloves, Jones said.
The two sites are in one application, but they have separate designs, 
separate security and will have separate safety and health monitoring 
programs. "We'll have to keep one set of records for the compact site and one 
set of records for the federal site," Jones said.
The company has been operating for six or seven years on a permit from the 
U.S. Department of Energy. It employs 94 people, and if the disposal facility 
were added, that figure would rise to 150 to 200 employees. Jones stressed 
the safety precautions the company takes and said Waste Control celebrated 
three years without a lost time accident on May 10.
Currently, Jones said Waste Control ships waste off for disposal. But the 
material could be on site for up to two years.
"In some cases, the generator of the waste wants us to treat it and return it 
to them. In other cases, we treat it and send it to Hanford, Wash., the 
Nevada Test Site or to Envirocare in Utah," Jones said.
Waste Control can also take waste the Environmental Protection Agency 
classifies as hazardous waste. "We treat it and we can dispose of it," Jones 
said.
Waste the EPA classifies as hazardous contains certain chemicals or elements 
that shouldn't be released into the environment such as lead, cadmium and 
arsenic. Things that are corrosive or reactive that react with water or air 
and are flammable or toxic are considered hazardous by EPA, Jones said.
Some of the waste also came from Gulf Nuclear, formerly of Odessa, which made 
sealed sources to calibrate instruments such as medical devices. 
Jones said the company went bankrupt and the EPA cleaned it up. That waste is 
now waiting to be stored at Yucca Mountain, Nev., when it opens.
Material Waste Control gets mainly comes from national labs, but it also gets 
material from private companies, research companies and a "variety of state 
and federal facilities," Jones said.
"The majority of the waste seems to be contaminated soil," Jones said.
Most of the waste is received in 55-gallon drums, but there are various size 
containers approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation such as 
intermodals, like the boxcars that come in on trains, and specialty tankers 
pulled by trucks, Jones said.
For the Department of Energy, Waste Control has 2,200 drums from Rocky Flats, 
a Department of Energy lab just outside of Denver that is in the process of 
being decommissioned, Jones said.
"In doing that, they're trying to dispose of materials from the last 30 to 40 
years," he said.
Waste Control also has had a research and development project going for a 
more than a year where waste is turned into glass. "We're proving the 
feasibility, proving the economics of it," Jones said. If it's successful, it 
will be made permanent.
"It would be a way to dispose of waste by tying everything up so it wouldn't 
be able to leach out," Jones said.
Located right on the border with Lea County, N.M., Waste Control has 14,400 
acres with 1,340 acres devoted to low-level radioactive waste storage.
Jones said the land has unique geology because there is no water on it and 
the clay is close to the surface.
There has been some dispute over whether the site is over the Ogallala 
Aquifer. Waste Control officials contend it is not.
Since the early 1990s, Jones said, Waste Control has drilled a number of 
wells and as part of the licensing application to TCEQ has had a team of 
geologists on site.
All agree it does not sit on top of the aquifer. In the case of Waste 
Control, the site sits on 20 to 30 feet of caliche, five feet of sand and 
gravel and 800 feet of clay.
"That's what makes this such a unique site to dispose of waste on," Jones 
said.

Article Posted: 07/16/2004 10:44:45 AM
Gov. Johanns, Attorney General Bruning Discuss Low-Level Waste Negotiations
    
(Lincoln, Neb.) Gov. Mike Johanns and Attorney General Jon Bruning today 
released a proposal provided to the state of Texas by the state of Nebraska 
and the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission and 
announced the filing of Nebraska's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court of a $151 
million judgment against the state. 

Nebraska is asking the High Court to hear the appeal on three grounds: first, 
to review whether the state waived its immunity from the lawsuit for monetary 
damages filed by the Compact Commission; second, was the state entitled to a 
jury trial; and third, did the lower court award too much prejudgment 
interest. 

The Texas proposal is part of an effort to settle the Compact Commission's 
lawsuit against Nebraska. In 2004, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld 
a lower court judgment that found that Nebraska's previous administration had 
acted in bad faith in the licensing process to build a low-level waste site 
in the state. 

The interest on that $151 million judgment has been accumulating at a federal 
rate of 1.68 percent since September 2002. As of today, Nebraska owes 
approximately $156 million with interest. If Nebraska loses its appeal and 
cannot immediately pay the judgment, the applicable interest rate will 
increase. Nebraska believes that applicable rate would be 3 percent while the 
Compact Commission contends that it is 10 percent. If the Court agrees with 
the Compact Commission, the state could owe as much as $202 million by August 
of 2005. 

Separate from the judgment, the Compact Commission contends that Nebraska is 
obligated to host a low-level site in addition to paying the judgment. The 
Compact Commission also contends that Nebraska generators should be barred 
from accessing that site. 

Gov. Johanns said, "I want to be very clear about the fact that there is more 
at stake than the judgment that we owe. The Compact claims that we owe the 
full judgment with enhanced interest and that we have an obligation to host a 
site. We are strongly disputing these claims, but it is very important for 
Nebraskans to understand what is potentially at stake. The worst case 
scenario forces Nebraska to both pay the $202 million judgment and host a 
site that our own generators could be barred from accessing." 

Attorney General Bruning said, "As we have said all along, we will leave no 
stone unturned in our efforts to protect the state from having to the pay 
this enormous amount of money. If the Texas proposal is accepted, any amount 
paid to Texas must be credited toward the judgment. It is important to 
recognize that an agreement with Texas does not resolve all of the issues 
between Nebraska and the Compact. Even if we don't reach agreement with 
Texas, there are other options for resolving this case. Any agreement with 
Texas is subject to Nebraska and the Compact resolving all low-level issues 
in a full and final settlement." 

I cannot stress enough the complexity and sensitivity of the ongoing 
negotiations. While the Governor and I understand the interest in the terms 
of our negotiations, any premature release of information could impede the 
process. Nebraska cannot afford to let that happen. Therefore, we will not be 
able to discuss this matter in further detail until it is resolved."

Nebraska appeals nuke dump decision to U.S. Supreme Court

By The Associated Press
LINCOLN - Nebraska officials don't have a lot of confidence that the U.S. 
Supreme Court will overturn the $151 million judgment the state has been 
ordered to pay for blocking efforts to build a nuclear dump within its 
borders.

The court receives about 8,000 appeals annually. It hears only about 80.

And Attorney General Jon Bruning said Friday he was not optimistic that 
Nebraska would win - even if the high court takes the case.

"Look at the track record in this litigation - we haven't won anything yet," 
Bruning said. "That's not to say we have no chance. But let's be realistic - 
it's a long shot."

U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf of Lincoln ruled in 2002 that former 
Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, now a U.S. senator, engaged in a politically 
motivated and orchestrated plot to keep the regional dump from being built in 
Nebraska.

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld that ruling, and Nebraska on 
Friday appealed to the Supreme Court.

The dump was to take waste from the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive 
Waste Compact, which consists of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and 
Arkansas.

Nebraska doesn't have the money to pay the court judgment because of an 
ongoing budget crunch and has been trying to negotiate a settlement with the 
compact.

The compact earlier rejected a settlement offer and said it would offer a 
counterproposal. Compact officials are scheduled to discuss negotiations at a 
meeting next week.

Gov. Mike Johanns has approached Texas Gov. Rick Perry about storing nuclear 
waste there as part of a settlement.

Details of that offer were released Friday.

As part of the deal, Nebraska has offered to pay Texas a flat fee of $25 
million to take a compact's low-level radioactive waste. Nebraska also 
offered to pay $5 million to Texas to cover any unforeseen expenses for 
storing the waste.

The letter making the offer was signed by Assistant Attorney General David 
Cookson and Shawn Renner, one the compact's lawyers - a clear indication that 
the compact is comfortable with the idea.

"We're taking a look at their proposal, but beyond that, there is not a whole 
lot left to say," said Perry spokesman Robert Black. "Even if it were 
something to be considered as a possibility by our office, it would be years, 
if not a decade before something could occur."

The Texas Legislature approved a bill last year that allows for the creation 
of two privately run waste disposal facilities licensed by the state. One 
would handle waste under a compact between Texas, Vermont and Maine, although 
Maine has since dropped out of the compact.

A separate but adjacent facility would take U.S. Department of Energy waste.

With interest, the judgment against Nebraska now stands at $156 million.

The compact, however, is arguing in court that Nebraska should pay a higher 
interest rate, which would put the total at $202 million.

The compact also argues that Nebraska is still obligated to host a site and 
wants to bar Nebraska generators of low-level waste from using the facility.

"Do not be mistaken, paying the judgment does not make the issue of the site 
go away," Johanns said. "Building the site does not make the judgment go away.

"Unless we can get an overall settlement, we are still going to be fighting 
this," Johanns said.

Johanns said communities "from a number of parts of the state" have expressed 
interest in possibly hosting the site, but he refused to elaborate.

The Nebraska dump was to be built in Boyd County in the northeast part of the 
state.

Nebraska officials argued that they didn't license the dump because of 
concerns about possible pollution and a high-water table at the proposed site.

The battle in Nebraska over the dump had its genesis in 1970, when Nevada, 
South Carolina and Washington grew tired of accepting low-level radioactive 
waste from the rest of the country.

Congress told states in 1980 to build their own dumps or join regional groups 
to dispose of the waste, which includes contaminated tools and clothing from 
nuclear power plants, hospitals and research centers.

The Central Interstate compact was formed in 1983 and the other states voted 
in 1987 to put the dump in Nebraska.

Both sides began wrestling in court on several issues soon after.

No compact has built a dump, and many people theorize that the first one 
constructed could become a national repository.

TCEQ reviewing Nebraska radioactive-waste proposal
Odessa American
Saturday, 24 July 2004
http://www.oaoa.com/news/nw072404g.htm

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is reviewing a proposal that 
would have Texas taking low-level radioactive waste from Nebraska.
"We're reviewing their proposal, and we're doing due diligence on it. We have 
no idea how long that will take," Andy Saenz said, TCEQ communications 
director.
Doing due diligence means TCEQ is "going through the fine points of the 
proposal and doing the kind of work you've got to do to evaluate it 
properly," Saenz said.
Nebraska, part of the Central Interstate Compact Commission, which also 
includes Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, backed out on a deal to 
host a level-level radioactive site in the northeastern part of the state.
The compact sued and won a $151 million judgment. With interest, that amount 
will hit $202 million when it's due in August 2005.
Nebraska has offered to pay Texas a total of $30 million to take the waste, 
which would likely wind up at the Waste Control Specialists site in Andrews 
County.
The compact's case is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, but an 
agreement with Texas could get Nebraska out from under the judgment.
Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that discussions are continuing to 
settle the lawsuit. Representatives of the states, excluding Nebraska, met 
for two-and-a-half hours in executive session Friday in Overland Park, Kan. 
It was decided to continue negotiations.
The compact has until Aug. 19 to respond to Nebraska's appeal to the Supreme 
Court, AP reported Friday.

Neb. nuclear waste dump discussions will continue

http://www.ljworld.com/section/stateregional/story/176579

Overland Park Ñ Discussions will continue to settle a multimillion dollar 
lawsuit accusing Nebraska of blocking construction of a low-level nuclear 
waste dump, members of the regional group suing the state said Friday.
    
Representatives of the other four states in the Central Interstate Low-Level 
Radioactive Waste Compact met for 2 1/2 hours behind closed doors in Overland 
Park before saying they had given their attorneys guidance in negotiations 
with Nebraska.

"We look forward to hearing from our counsel as soon as they have acted upon 
this," said compact chairwoman Laura Gilson.

Gilson, who represents Arkansas, declined afterward to say what that guidance 
is or anything about the negotiations.

"We have been listening to Nebraska and working in good faith and will 
continue to do so through our counsel," Gilson said.

The compact earlier rejected a settlement offer and said it would offer a 
counterproposal. Gilson would not comment on the status of any proposal or 
counterproposal.

"I'm not free to discuss anything," she said. "That's a matter for our 
counsel to handle."

Kansas compact representative Jim O'Connell said in an interview that he felt 
Nebraska officials were working in good faith with the commission.

Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns and Atty. Gen. Jon Bruning both have been 
responsible and responsive toward discussions about a possible settlement, 
O'Connell said.

A spokeswoman for Bruning declined to comment Friday on the status of any 
settlement.

Nebraska has been ordered by a federal judge to pay $151 million to the 
compact, which also includes Oklahoma and Louisiana. The judge said Nebraska 
acted in bad faith in 1998 when it denied an application to build a waste 
dump.

The dump was to take waste from the compact states.

Nebraksa leaders have been trying to reach an out-of-court settlement. At the 
same time, Nebraska has appealed U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf's decision 
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The compact has until Aug. 19 to respond to that appeal.

The goal of the compact remains to find a place to take the waste, O'Connell 
said.

Johanns also has approached Texas about storing nuclear waste from the 
compact states there.

If that is a workable solution, it should be pursued, O'Connell said.

Vanunu claims Israel has 100-200 nuclear weapons

Vanunu continues baiting security forces, as second half of the interview he
gave Al Wassat is released
Jackie Hogi
  
Only two days after the Supreme Court overruled Mordechai Vanunu's request to
remove the limitations imposed on him, the full interview with him has been
published in the London based Arabic weekly "al-Wassat".

It includes allegedly secret details regarding Israel's nuclear plan. The new
information raise heavy doubts regarding security breaches.

"Israel possesses between 100-200 nuclear weapons, including a neutron bomb
and hydrogen bombs, which are tenfold in their effect", Vanunu claims during
the interview. "If an atomic bomb can kill 100 thousand people then the
hydrogen bomb can hurt a million".

Vanunu claims he will fight till his dying day for a permit to leave Israel
and seek political asylum abroad. "I will call for an international
convention in Cairo, including Israel, for dismantling nuclear weapons", he
says.

He also said he would try to develop his expertise in nuclear warfare. He
will begin lecturing on the subject before an audience in Nazareth soon as
well as resume his studies in a university abroad.

The interview with the "atom spy" doesn't only deal with Israel's nuclear
capacities. He also tells of his desire for a bride, and that meanwhile he
works at the Anglican Church in East Jerusalem. He intends to offer his
services to the UN's nuclear energy agency.

A police official says after the first publication that Vanunu will not face
arrest, just as he wasn't arrested following the interview with Sunday Times
reporter. The Shin-Bet is keeping an eye on his activities, aware of the
potential international criticism. Substantial evidence of violation of his
release terms must be gathered in order to make a good case, claims the
source.

Lawmakers must find money for settlement

LINCOLN (AP) - Now that Nebraska has agreed to pay $141 million for blocking 
efforts to build a regional low-level radioactive waste dump within its 
borders, lawmakers have to find the money.

"I have strong hope that we don't have to raise taxes - that we can absorb it 
some way," said Sen. Roger Wehrbein of Plattsmouth, chairman of the budget-
writing Appropriations Committee.

Nebraska is in the middle of an ongoing budget crisis and lawmakers will use 
the legislative session that begins in January to find the money.

"It won't be easy, but at least it will be behind us," Wehrbein said.

The other members of the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste 
Compact - Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana - voted 3-1 Monday to 
accept the settlement in their case against Nebraska. Kansas voted against 
the settlement, and Nebraska could not vote.

The settlement ended a lawsuit in which U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf in 
Lincoln ruled that former Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, now a U.S. senator, 
engaged in a politically motivated and orchestrated plot to keep the dump 
from being built in Nebraska. Kopf ordered Nebraska to pay $151 million.

 
Nebraska agreed Monday to drop its appeal of that decision to the U.S. 
Supreme Court.

Gov. Mike Johanns said Monday that the economy - and Nebraska's tax revenues -
 are improving.

"I do believe I can deliver a budget not requesting a tax increase to fund 
this" settlement money, he said.

Johanns stressed that the compact originally called for Nebraska to be 
responsible for the entire $151 million judgment, plus interest, bringing 
Nebraska's total obligation to $207 million.

The compact also had insisted that Nebraska was still obligated to host a 
nuclear waste dump, and that Nebraska would not be allowed to use the 
facility, Johanns said.

Under the settlement, Nebraska will not be obligated to allow a dump in the 
state.

"Considering the potential downside of this, this is a good settlement for 
the state," Johanns said.

Under terms of the settlement, Nebraska has the option of making four annual 
payments of $38.5 million starting next year.

With interest, that would bring the total amount paid to $154 million.

But the amount Nebraska pays could be reduced to $130 million if the compact 
and Nebraska successfully negotiate access for their waste at a proposed site 
in Texas.

The Texas Legislature approved a bill last year that allows for the licensing 
of two private waste disposal facilities.

Earlier, Nebraska offered to pay Texas a flat fee of $25 million to take the 
compact's low-level radioactive waste, plus $5 million to cover any 
unforeseen expenses for storing the waste.

The Nebraska dump was to have been built in the northeast part of the state 
and take waste from the compact.

Nebraska officials argued that they didn't license the dump because of 
concerns about possible pollution and a high water table at the proposed 
site - a process that Kopf ruled Nelson tainted.

Nelson was overseas traveling on Monday and could not be reached for comment.

His chief of staff, Tim Becker, said he was sure the settlement will be an 
issue in Nelson's re-election bid in 2006, especially if Johanns runs against 
him as expected.

"It has been a political issue - I suspect it will continue to be a political 
issue," Becker said

Kansas Considered for Dump Site 
AP

Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning says Kansas is next in line for a 
nuclear waste dump if plans for Texas to take the waste don't work out.

Under a $141 million settlement accepted by the five-state compact, Nebraska 
won't have to host the dump site.

The vote of the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact 
Commission to accept the Nebraska settlement was 3-to-1, with Kansas 
voting "no" and Nebraska not allowed to vote.

A federal judge ruled two years ago that when he was governor of Nebraska, 
Ben Nelson engaged in a politically motivated and orchestrated plot to keep 
the dump out of his state.

The Kansan on the commission, Jim O'Connell, says he opposed the settlement 
because Nebraska blocked construction of the site in Boyd County.

  By REUTERS

Published: August 10, 2004

Filed at 11:14 p.m. ET

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Earlier on Tuesday, Kerry
accused the Bush administration of recklessly
putting politics above science and vowed to
prevent Nevada from becoming America's nuclear
waste dump.

The state's Yucca Mountain -- which Bush approved
in 2002 as a burial site for radioactive refuse
from nuclear power plants and weapons -- has
become a centerpiece of the closely contested Nov.
2 White House race in Nevada.

'SCIENCE, NOT POLITICS'

Kerry said Bush had broken his promise as a
candidate in 2000 to base his decision on ``sound
science, not politics'' and cited a slew of
skeptical studies from the U.S. government's
General Accounting Office, the National Academy of
Sciences and other bodies.

``When John Kerry is president, there's going to
be no nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, period,''
he told invited guests at the Ralph Cadwallader
Middle School, about 90 miles from the site.

While the issue is largely local, it could help
determine the presidential race. Nevada is a key
battleground state that Bush won in 2000, and
without its five electoral votes would not be in
the White House. He will visit Las Vegas on
Thursday.

Bush and his Republican allies say they were
relying on years of study by the Energy Department
and that they believe scientific concerns will be
answered either by the courts or by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in its licensing of the
project.

Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt pointed out
that Kerry had voted for the 1987 Nuclear Waste
Policy Act Amendments, known in the state as the
``screw Nevada bill'' which was tacked onto budget
legislation.

``When it has counted -- on real votes to say 'No'
to Yucca mountain, I voted 'No','' Kerry said.

His vice presidential running mate John Edwards, a
senator from North Carolina, voted in 2002 for the
Yucca plan but campaign aides said he and Kerry
were now on the same page.

The school where Kerry spoke sits near the route
that nuclear waste would travel to the repository,
just like many other schools and communities in 44
states. The so called ``mobile Chernobyls'' would
pass through many communities that Kerry said were
ill-equipped to respond to a nuclear accident,
posing a risk to the more than 50 million
Americans along the way.

Kerry said the United States needed a Manhattan
Project ``to tame the negative consequences of the
power of the atom'' and pledged to set up a panel
of the world's best scientists to study how to
deal with nuclear storage and waste.

``Yucca Mountain to me is a symbol of the
recklessness and the arrogance with which they are
willing to proceed with respect to the safety
issues and concerns of the American people,'' he
said.

Kerry Says Bush Broke Nuclear Waste Vow
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Published: August 10, 2004

Filed at 11:30 p.m. ET

LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Democratic presidential
challenger John Kerry, making a play for a state
that supported President Bush four years ago,
accused the president of breaking his word with a
plan to bury nuclear waste in Nevada.

Kerry said the president broke the promise he made
in the 2000 race to ensure science and not
politics determined his decision whether to ship
waste to Yucca Mountain. Bush approved Yucca
Mountain as the nation's nuclear dump site after
winning the presidency, even though many
scientific studies remained unfinished.

``It's about promises kept and promises broken,''
Kerry said during an appearance at a school along
the route that the waste would be shipped.

He made his own campaign promise: ``When John
Kerry is president, there is going to be no
nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. Period,'' he
said.

Kerry remained focused on Yucca Mountain while
campaigning in Nevada, even as other events
dominated the presidential campaign. But at a
rally attended by thousands Tuesday night, he
defended himself from Bush's charge that he has
changed his position on the Iraq war.

``I voted to stand up to Saddam Hussein, but I
thought we ought to do it right,'' Kerry said. ``I
thought we ought to reach out to other countries,
we ought to build an international coalition.''

He did not speak about Bush's selection of Florida
Rep. Porter Goss to head the CIA, instead
responding by written statement from his campaign
headquarters in Washington.

Kerry's statement called for quick Senate hearings
on Goss' nomination but kept the heat on Bush to
name a national intelligence director and follow
other recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission.

For years, Nevada has been fighting plans to move
the nation's used reactor fuel to Yucca Mountain.

Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt accused
Kerry of flip-flopping on Yucca Mountain because
Kerry has voted for some measures that included
provisions that would have allowed nuclear dumps
there. But every time he has faced the simple
choice of voting whether or not to send waste to
Yucca, Kerry has voted against it.

Kerry said he is concerned about the safety and
security of storing the waste 90 miles outside of
Las Vegas at a mountain that sits atop the
region's major water supply. Kerry also noted
seismic activity has been measured at the mountain
and could pose a safety threat.

A federal appeals court last month rejected the
Environmental Protection Agency's radiation
standard for the repository, which could doom the
project. Kerry promised at the rally, ``If they
try to change the standards on radiation at the
EPA and they send it to my desk, veto pen. Gone.
Out.''

Kerry said he would leave waste at nuclear sites
around the country while he instructs the National
Academy of Science to study how the world should
deal with nuclear waste and storage.

Kerry and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Nevada
voters should choose Kerry for another reason -- 
he saved the life of one of their senators.

Kerry and Reid recalled how, on was July 12, 1988,
Nevada Republican Sen. Chic Hecht was attending a
weekly GOP luncheon in the Capitol when a piece of
apple lodged in his throat. Kerry, running late
for the corresponding Democratic luncheon, was
just getting off an elevator when he saw Hecht
buckled over in the corridor. He rushed over and
performed the Heimlich maneuver.

``I suspect that I was late for that meeting and I
walked out of that elevator because there was a
higher power that said that was the moment that I
was blessed to be there for Chic Hecht,'' Kerry
said.

Exelon Gets Refund for Spent Fuel
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Published: August 10, 2004

Filed at 6:26 p.m. ET

WARRENVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Exelon Corp. said
Tuesday the Department of Justice agreed to
immediately reimburse the power-plant operator for
$80 million in costs incurred for the storage of
spent nuclear fuel.

Also, the door was left open for further payments.

Exelon said it may eventually receive about $300
million gross if the Department of Energy, which
participated in the negotiations, begins accepting
spent nuclear fuel and opens a national repository
by 2010.

The agreement settles all pending spent-fuel suits
that Exelon and its units have brought against the
federal government. Reimbursements will cover
costs incurred by the company related to
Department of Energy delays. The department was
supposed to begin accepting spent fuel in 1998,
the company said.

Chicago-based Exelon, which operates about
one-sixth of the nuclear power plants in the
United States, said it still backs permanent
used-fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain, the
controversial proposed dumping site in Nevada.

For 2003, Exelon earned $905 million, or $2.75 a
share, on revenue of $15.81 billion.

Shares of the company closed Tuesday at $36.51, up
37 cents, or 1 percent, on the New York Stock
Exchange.


================================================================

"It is frustrating," said Ron Hammerschmidt, director of the Division of 
Environment at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. "The compact 
system hasn't worked. Congress needs to go back to the drawing board and 
figure out how to handle this on a national basis," he said.

Radioactive-waste disposal at critical stage 
By Scott Rothschild, Journal-World 
Monday, August 16, 2004 

A settlement last week over where to dump Kansas' radioactive waste settled 
nothing and leaves Kansas and the nation with dwindling options for disposal 
of low-level waste, officials said.

After a failed appeal and months of negotiations, a compact of states agreed 
to let Nebraska pay $141 million to be relieved of its obligation to build a 
regional depository within its borders.

The decision by the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact 
ended years of litigation and a decadeslong effort to build a dump site in 
Nebraska for radioactive waste produced there and in Kansas, Oklahoma, 
Arkansas and Louisiana.

"It is frustrating," said Ron Hammerschmidt, director of the Division of 
Environment at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. 

"The compact system hasn't worked. Congress needs to go back to the drawing 
board and figure out how to handle this on a national basis," he said.

Running out of space

In 1980, Congress told states to put together regional compacts to develop 
dumps for low-level radioactive waste, such as contaminated tools and clothes 
that are produced by nuclear power plants, hospitals and research centers. 

Kansas currently sends its low-level radioactive waste to sites in South 
Carolina and Utah. But the South Carolina facility has told the Central 
Interstate compact it is closing its doors in 2008 to waste from states 
outside its region. The Utah site has ample capacity but doesn't accept the 
more highly contaminated low-level waste, officials said.

Hammerschmidt said Kansas and other states would have time to find a 
solution. "We're not going to see it show up on bags on street corners," he 
said.

But given that it has been more than 20 years since the compact system was 
launched and not one site has been developed anywhere in the country, 
officials point out that time is running out.

'Back to square one'

Warren Wood, general counsel for the Wolf Creek nuclear plant near 
Burlington, noted the license application for the Nebraska site was submitted 
in 1990. Then Nebraska officials sought to back out of the deal, kicking off 
a controversy that brewed in the courts for most of the 1990s.

"There was a lot of time wasted," Wood said. "We're back to square one."

Now some of the states in the compact are looking toward Texas, where a 
license has been filed to build a waste disposal facility in sparsely 
populated Andrews County. But previous efforts to locate radioactive dumps in 
Texas have been met with waves of opposition.

"Nobody wants to have a facility in their back yard," Wood said. "Wherever 
there is an effort to get one developed there is typically opposition, and so 
far the opposition has succeeded." 

The money Nebraska is to pay in the settlement goes back to the compact, 
officials said. Utilities that have contributed to the compact probably will 
seek to get the money returned to them. 

Nebraska in a bind

The settlement with Nebraska ended a lawsuit in which a federal judge in 
Lincoln, Neb., found that former Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, now a U.S. 
senator, had tried to stop the dump from being built for political gain. 
Nebraska officials argued they didn't license the facility because of 
environmental concerns.

The compact of states voted 3-1 for the settlement. Nebraska wasn't allowed 
to vote. Kansas was the lone vote against it. 

James O'Connell, Kansas' representative on the compact, said the 
settlement "signals a failure of the compact system when there's no present 
and complete alternative site in place."

The decision has Nebraska officials scurrying to find ways to pay off the 
debt amid a tight budget. 

Reports have indicated Nebraska has offered to pay Texas a flat fee of $25 
million to accept the compact's waste, raising alarms by some opponents of 
the waste facility in Texas. They worry that if Texas opens to states outside 
its compact, it could become the dumping ground for the entire nation.

Meanwhile, the few current facilities continue to fill up.

"We will eventually get to the point that we have to do something," said 
Wood. "There is going to have to be a solution eventually."

Pantex nuclear facility repairs costly
Associated Press

AMARILLO, Texas - Sealant used in a nuclear weapons plant to prevent 
plutonium from leaking in case of an accidental blast is peeling, and a 
repair job could cost $20 million, a government report shows.

The Department of Defense's Pantex Plant is the nation's only nuclear weapons 
assembly and disassembly plant and technicians work with radioactive and 
explosive materials at the complex around the clock.

According to a report by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, sealant 
had been applied to faulty door welds on underground workshops at the plant 
after officials learned that a 6-year-old work order to repair them was never 
completed.

The government temporarily halted nuclear weapons operations at the plant 
while it repaired the welds with the sealant. Afterward, operations resumed.

But in a July 21 report, an official with the nuclear facilities safety board 
found the sealant was peeling away in places. Now, safety board officials say 
sealing potential leak spots could cost between $15 and $20 million.

Engineers at the plant are studying the extent of the problem and will report 
its findings to the safety board.

The cells that contain the subterranean workshops are designed to prevent the 
spread of radioactivity in the unlikely event of an accidental blast. The 
cells are supposed to collapse inward and trap radioactive debris.

Pantex repairs may be flawed 
By JIM McBRIDE
jim.mcbride@amarillo.com 
The Amarillo Globe-News 

Pantex Plant repairs aimed at limiting plutonium releases during an 
accidental, high-explosive blast may be flawed and could require a $20 
million safety overhaul, government reports show.
The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an agency overseeing safety at 
U.S. nuclear weapons plants, has asked Pantex officials to prepare a detailed 
report, prioritizing measures to reduce off-site plutonium releases during an 
accidental explosion.

Assembly cells - robust, saucerlike domes of concrete, gravel and steel - 
house the subterranean workshops where Pantex technicians dismantle, repair 
or modify warheads in America's atomic arsenal.

Dubbed "Gravel Gerties" - after a popular Dick Tracy character - the 
structures are designed to filter out 99 percent of aerosolized plutonium 
released during an accidental high-explosive blast. 

After such an "extremely unlikely" detonation, the cells are supposed to 
expand, then collapse inward, trapping radioactive debris inside.

Several years ago, Pantex safety experts learned that an explosion could spew 
radioactive materials through the cell's structural cracks and pipe openings 
instead of filtering them through gravel layers in the cell roof.

One theoretical accident scenario continues to stymie Pantex engineers: an 
explosive blast fails to lift the roof off a Pantex assembly cell, spewing 
radioactive materials into the atmosphere through cracks and sheared pipes in 
the facility.

Pantex halted nuclear weapons operations in nuclear weapons assembly cells in 
September after plant officials learned that a 6-year-old work order to 
repair faulty cell door welds had never been completed. Workers later closed 
the welds with a commercial sealant and nuclear explosive operations resumed.

Since then, contractor BWXT Pantex has recalculated the potential off-site 
radiological effects of an accidental high-explosive blast, taking into 
account newly sealed areas around the cells.

But a nuclear safety board staffer recently noticed the sealant used to patch 
incomplete welds near assembly cell doors was peeling away from the doors, 
according to a July 21 report.

Pantex safety specialists had credited the assembly cell door sealant 
with "dispersal reductions" that would limit or reduce off-site radiological 
releases during an accident.

But the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board now questions the conclusions 
in BWXT Pantex's accident analysis and says plutonium "dispersal reductions" 
cited in the analysis are not adequately justified.

"The peeling and detaching of the external sealant raises concern as to the 
ability of the sealant to perform its intended safety-class function on the 
inside joints of the doors," the board's report says.

In an Aug. 6 letter, the safety board challenged the plutonium "dispersal 
reductions" cited in the Pantex analysis and said an assembly cell accident 
could exceed federal limits for off-site radiological doses.

"The analysis also includes dispersal reductions that result from repairs 
made to address the incomplete welds. These repairs may not be effective," 
the letter says.

The safety board has asked Pantex to investigate the possibility of using low-
temperature welds to seal assembly cell door cracks. Sealing up potential 
leak spots could cost between $15-20 million, according to government 
estimates.

Joe Papp, BWXT Pantex's system engineering section manager, said Pantex 
discovered more structural cracks, called "cell pathways," in 2003 during the 
plant's standard safety review process.

"While additional pathways could potentially increase the off-site effects, 
Pantex continues to remain below the off-site exposure guidelines," Papp said 
in a response to Globe-News inquiries. "The studies and calculations used to 
analyze these pathways were conservative and took the most extreme scenarios 
into account. The structural cracks were filled with sealant."

Papp said Pantex now is analyzing the sealant before it completes a thorough 
report to the safety board.

"Pantex is conducting studies of the sealant to determine its effectiveness. 
Longer-term actions are exploring the possibility of replacing the sealant 
with welds. BWXT Pantex will provide a detailed report to the defense board 
once further analysis is complete," Papp said.

N. Korea calls Bush 'human trash' and says nuclear talks pointless
By Tim Johnson
Inquirer Foreign Staff

BEIJING - North Korea called President Bush "human trash" yesterday, raising
its invective to a new level a day after labeling the U.S. leader
a "political idiot" and comparing him to Hitler.

It was the second consecutive day that North Korea has issued unusually
strident personal criticism of Bush.

In its tirade, the communist North Korean government reiterated its
contention that future six-party talks on its nuclear-weapons program were
pointless.

North Korea "can no longer pin any hope on the six-party talks, and there is
a question as to whether there is any need for it to negotiate with the U.S.
anymore," the statement said.

While impoverished North Korea has used insults to capture Washington's
attention before negotiations, the latest outpouring came while the talks
were in limbo. Many analysts say the North Korean weapons crisis has entered
relative dormancy until after the U.S. presidential elections in November.

Several factors appear to be irritating Pyongyang, including this week's
annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean troops to strengthen
their readiness for a possible war with the North. The exercises began Monday
and will last 12 days.

South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Soo-Hyuk, meanwhile, arrived in
Beijing to discuss ways to end a stalemate over the six-party talks with host
China, the United States, the two Koreas, Russia and Japan.

Still in doubt is whether North Korean envoys will attend working-group talks
in Beijing later this month or more senior-level talks by the end of
September. Three rounds of high-level talks have occurred since August 2003.

North Korea said Bush had "hurled malignant slander and calumnies" against
it, an apparent reference to a campaign remark last Wednesday in Wisconsin in
which Bush explained why he sought the backing of other regional powers to
get North Korea to disarm.

"I felt it was important to bring other countries into the mix, like China
and Japan and South Korea and Russia, so there's now five countries saying to
the tyrant in North Korea: 'Disarm, disarm,' " Bush said.

White House spokesman Scott McClellan yesterday called the latest comments by
North Korea "just more bluster."

"What North Korea needs to do is take steps to end its nuclear-weapons
program," McClellan told reporters in Crawford, Texas. "All five parties are
sending a clear message to North Korea that they need to end their pursuit of
nuclear weapons. Then they can begin to realize the full benefits of the
international community."

Rising to the challenge of global name-calling, North Korea's latest
statement said: "It is the greatest tragedy for the U.S. that Bush, a
political idiot and human trash, still remains in the presidential office of
the world's only superpower, styling himself an emperor of the world."

In its statement, North Korea also pledged to strengthen the "quality and
quantity" of its war deterrent to repel aggression. Pyongyang usually refers
to its nuclear capability as its war deterrent.

Texas county official hopes to accept regional nuke waste
Associated Press

LINCOLN, Neb. - Low-level radioactive waste generated in Nebraska and four 
other states in a compact would be welcome in Andrews County, Texas, says one 
county official.

"We would love to have you," Lloyd Eisenrich, president of the county's 
industrial foundation, told the Lincoln Journal Star.

Permanently housing the waste from nuclear power plants and hospitals would 
mean more money and jobs for the Texas county near the New Mexico border, 
Eisenrich said.

Gov. Mike Johanns has approached Texas Gov. Rick Perry about storing nuclear 
waste. Nebraska has offered to pay Texas $30 million if Texas were to accept 
the deal.

Johanns has said that a successful agreement with Texas could help lower a 
$151 million judgment against Nebraska.

In 2002, a district judge ruled that former Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, now a 
U.S. senator, engaged in a politically motivated plot to keep the regional 
dump from being built in Nebraska. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has 
upheld that ruling, and last month Nebraska appealed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.

The dump was to take waste from the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive 
Waste Compact, including Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas.

A telephone call by The Associated Press seeking comment from Perry's office 
was not immediately returned Tuesday.

With an average rainfall of about 14 inches and a 800-foot deep band of red 
clay that would act as a barrier against the waste entering the water system, 
Andrews County is the ideal home for the waste, which can remain radioactive 
for hundreds of years, Eisenrich said.

"We got a fantastic geological location to store it permanently," Eisenrich 
said.

The Texas Legislature approved a bill last year that allows for the creation 
of two privately run waste disposal facilities licensed by the state.

Companies wanting to build a low-level radioactive waste site have until 
Friday to submit an application and nonrefundable $500,000 application fee to 
the Texas Natural Resources Commission.

So far only one Texas company, Waste Control Specialists, has publicly 
announced its plans to submit an application. The company already has a 
hazardous waste storage facility about 45 miles northwest Andrews - the 
Andrews County seat.

Eisenrich said he's not aware of any local opposition to permanently storing 
the low-level radioactive waste in Andrews County.

"There's no organized opposition but there's bound to be individuals," he 
said.

New Nukes at U.S. Border  By Ryan Singel 
Story location: http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,64735,00.html
02:00 AM Aug. 27, 2004 PT

The border patrol has decided to go nuclear against those who want to sneak 
barrels of mustard gas, bales of marijuana or bundles of bucks into the 
country. 

Starting early next week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, agents 
will start testing a nuclear scanning device, called a Pulsed Fast Neutron 
Analysis system, that will show a border agent the molecular construction of 
all materials in an 18-wheeler without the agent having to open the truck. 

The $10 million system, which CBP installed in an old cotton field next to 
the Ysleta border crossing near El Paso, Texas, shoots pulsed neutrons 
through a cargo container's walls. Items in the trailer react to the mini-
bombardment by emitting gamma rays. The machine then reads the gamma ray 
signature to create a three-dimensional rendering of the inside of the 
container. 

The CBP's traditional X-ray machines create a two-dimensional, gray-scale 
picture that shows the comparative density and shape of items. A border-
protection agent then has to interpret the murky X-ray, just as a doctor does 
with a human X-ray. 

But the new device's manufacturer, Ancore of Santa Clara, California, says 
its Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis, or PFNA, machine not only creates a 3-D 
view -- it actually labels the parts. Thus the system can be configured to 
tell CBP officers that there are 100 kilos of cocaine hidden in a boxful of 
cheap DVDs or whether a barrel labeled "bleach" actually contains radioactive 
material. 

Doug Brown, a nuclear physicist who now works as Ancore's vice president of 
business development, calls the technology a "quantum leap," comparing its 
advantages to those of MRIs. 

"If you have a brain lesion, you can X-ray the hell out of your head and you 
will see the sockets for your eyeballs, your jawbone and your teeth, but you 
get no clue whether you have a lesion in your soft tissue," Brown said. "An 
MRI, on the other hand, is able to locate that lesion in three dimensions, 
based on a signature that is different in the lesion than in the healthy 
tissue. Our technology works exactly the same way. 

"A lot of threats are packed in barrels. An X-ray of a barrel would simply 
show a full barrel but wouldn't tell you it was full of water, oil or 
explosives," Brown said. "PFNA can determine what is in barrels." 

The technology is not new; it was developed in the late 1990s with federal 
funding from both anti-drug and antiterrorism efforts. 

The technology was never put in place, however, since it was considered too 
expensive for drug-detection deployment. 

But times have changed, according to Brown. "For the post-9/11 world, it's a 
rhetorical question: How safe do you want to be?" Brown said. 

Ancore's champion in Congress is Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D-Texas), a former 
Border Patrol inspector chief who has been pushing for the new technology 
since 1998. 

Now, the congressman is "thrilled" that the Transportation Security 
Administration, the Pentagon and the CBP have agreed to sponsor the 90-day 
test. The TSA will soon be using the technology to screen cargo that goes 
into the bellies of commercial airplanes. 

"This could be the most powerful technology in our war on terrorism," said 
Reye's spokeswoman, Kira Maas. "It really is incredible." 

Despite the availability of new funds for the technology, Brown emphasizes 
that his company is working hard with its parent company, OSI Systems, to 
make sure that production costs will be much lower than the price tag 
attached to its prototype. 

Given the current budget deficit and that the border with Mexico has 42 
crossing stations, placing one machine at every land crossing in the country -
- let alone at all the country's seaports and air terminals -- would be a 
significant burden on the Department of Homeland Security's $36 billion 
budget. 

Besides the unit's $10 million price tag, the only other catch is that, well, 
the system is nuclear. 

To keep workers and neighbors safe, drones will pull trucks into the shed, 
some employees will have to have radiation badges, and the locals will have 
to be protected from radiation gases. 

Leading up to the system's deployment, the government had scientists measure 
whether neutron-scanned tortilla chips will be too hot for folks to dip into 
salsa. 

They also had to figure out if the nuclear scanner would accidentally 
detonate a nuclear bomb (it won't, but it will detect it and might 
accidentally disable it). 

The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements looked closely 
(PDF) at the system and recommended several measures to help reduce the risk 
to employees or neighbors, but did not find the system to be an unacceptable 
risk. 

Even if every border-crossing station had the neutron scanner, the sheer 
amount of commercial traffic crossing the border would prohibit border agents 
from inspecting every truck. 

Between 26,000 and 30,000 trucks cross the border monthly at the Ysleta 
facility, according to CBP spokesman Roger Maier, and agents will still have 
to rely on their intuition and training to decide which trucks will get the 
neutron treatment. 

Still, if the scanner actually is able to accurately detail the full contents 
of a truck in about 10 minutes, it could free agents from the meticulous task 
of searching the most suspicious trucks by hand, a process that takes about 
two hours.

Plutonium Shipment Plan Worries Lawmakers
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Published: August 25, 2004

Filed at 6:31 p.m. ET

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some congressional Democrats
raised security concerns Wednesday about a
proposed shipment of 300 pounds of weapons-grade
plutonium from the United States to France for
conversion into a mixed-oxide fuel.

The Energy Department plans to send the plutonium
by truck from the Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico to the navy yard in Charleston,
S.C., where it will be loaded on a ship bound for
Cherbourg, France, as part of a U.S.-Russian
nonproliferation program.

     Advertisement

Rep. Jim Turner of Texas, the ranking Democrat on
the Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter
to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham that he was
concerned about the security of the shipment,
especially when it reaches France.

``It is clear that extraordinary security is
planned for the shipment,'' Turner said in his
letter.

But, he said, he wants greater assurances that
security for the shipment in France would be of
the same level as planned for in the United
States. He also questioned whether there had been
adequate ``independent oversight and review'' of
the shipment plan by other agencies.

Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also raised concerns
about the shipments. Markey, a member of the
Homeland Security Committee, questioned whether
the Department of Homeland Security has reviewed
the plan.

The Energy Department says the shipment has been
meticulously planned with high levels of security
incorporated.

Once the shipment arrives in Cherbourg, it is to
go by land to a French reprocessing facility,
where the plutonium can be turned into a less
dangerous mixed oxide. Then it is to be returned
to the United States.

The Energy Department plans to use that material
in four fuel assemblies at Duke Energy's Catawba
nuclear power plant in South Carolina. The test
assemblies are part of a U.S.-Russian program in
which each country has pledged to dispose of 64
metric tons of excess plutonium.

The United States plans to dispose of its material
by burning it in commercial nuclear reactors as
mixed oxide. However, the initial shipments have
to be sent to France because the United States has
yet to build a mixed-oxide processing facility.

Details of the shipment, including timing, are
classified, but it is expected to occur later this
year. According to the Energy Department, the
plutonium would be carried on two British vessels
guarded by specially trained British troops and
escorted by the U.S. Coast Guard in U.S. waters.

Tuesday 31st August 2004 :
Depleted Uranium: The Trojan Horse of Nuclear War

The use of depleted uranium weaponry by the United States, defying all
international treaties, will slowly annihilate all species on earth including
the human species, and yet this country continues to do so with full
knowledge of its destructive potential.

by LEUREN MORET

Since 1991, the United States has staged four wars using depleted uranium
weaponry, illegal under all international treaties, conventions and
agreements, as well as under the US military law. The continued use of this
illegal radioactive weaponry, which has already contaminated vast regions
with low level radiation and will contaminate other parts of the world over
time, is indeed a world affair and an international issue. The deeper purpose
is revealed by comparing regions now contaminated with depleted uranium -
from Egypt, the Middle East, Central Asia and the northern half of India - to
the US geostrategic imperatives described in Zbigniew Brzezinski's 1997 book
The Grand Chessboard.

The fact is that the United States and its military partners have staged four
nuclear wars, "slipping nukes under the wire" by using dirty bombs and dirty
weapons in countries the US needs to control. Depleted uranium aerosols will
permanently contaminate vast regions and slowly destroy the genetic future of
populations living in those regions, where there are resources which the US
must control, in order to establish and maintain American primacy.

Described as the Trojan Horse of nuclear war, depleted uranium is the weapon
that keeps killing. The half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years, the
age of the earth. And, as Uranium-238 decays into daughter radioactive
products, in four steps before turning into lead, it continues to release
more radiation at each step. There is no way to turn it off, and there is no
way to clean it up. It meets the US Government's own definition of Weapons of
Mass Destruction.

After forming microscopic and submicroscopic insoluble Uranium oxide
particles on the battlefield, they remain suspended in air and travel around
the earth as a radioactive component of atmospheric dust, contaminating the
environment, indiscriminately killing, maiming and causing disease in all
living things where rain, snow and moisture remove it from the atmosphere.
Global radioactive contamination from atmospheric testing was the equivalent
of 40,000 Hiroshima bombs, and still contaminates the atmosphere and lower
orbital space today. The amount of low level radioactive pollution from
depleted uranium released since 1991, is many times more (deposited
internally in the body), than was released from atmospheric testing fallout.

A 2003 independent report for the European Parliament by the European
Committee on Radiation Risk (ECRR), reports that based on Chernobyl studies,
low level radiation risk is 100 to 1000 times greater than the International
Committee for Radiation Protection models estimate which are based on the
flawed Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Studies conducted by the US Government.
Referring to the extreme killing effects of radiation on biological systems,
Dr. Rosalie Bertell, one of the 46 international radiation expert authors of
the ECRR report, describes it as:

"The concept of species annihilation means a relatively swift, deliberately
induced end to history, culture, science, biological reproduction and memory.
It is the ultimate human rejection of the gift of life, an act which requires
a new word to describe it: omnicide."

1943 MANHATTAN PROJECT BLUEPRINT FOR DEPLETED URANIUM

In a declassified memo to General Leslie R. Groves, dated October 30, 1943,
three of the top physicists in the Manhattan Project, Dr James B Conant, A H
Compton, and H C Urey, made their recommendation, as members of the
Subcommittee of the S-1 Executive Committee, on the 'Use of Radioactive
Materials as a Military Weapon':

"As a gas warfare instrument the material would be ground into particles of
microscopic size to form dust and smoke and distributed by a ground-fired
projectile, land vehicles, or aerial bombs. In this form it would be inhaled
by personnel. The amount necessary to cause death to a person inhaling the
material is extremely small ... There are no known methods of treatment for
such a casualty ... it will permeate a standard gas mask filter in quantities
large enough to be extremely damaging."

As a Terrain Contaminant:

"To be used in this manner, the radioactive materials would be spread on the
ground either from the air or from the ground if in enemy controlled
territory. In order to deny terrain to either side except at the expense of
exposing personnel to harmful radiations ... Areas so contaminated by
radioactive material would be dangerous until the slow natural decay of the
material took place ... for average terrain no decontaminating methods are
known. No effective protective clothing for personnel seems possible of
development. ... Reservoirs or wells would be contaminated or food poisoned
with an effect similar to that resulting from inhalation of dust or smoke."

Internal Exposure:

"... Particles smaller than 1µ [micron] are more likely to be deposited in
the alveoli where they will either remain indefinitely or be absorbed into
the lymphatics or blood. ... could get into the gastro-intestinal tract from
polluted water, or food, or air. ... may be absorbed from the lungs or G-I
tract into the blood and so distributed throughout the body."

Both the fission products and depleted uranium waste from the Atomic Bomb
Project were to be utilised under this plan. The pyrophoric nature of
depleted uranium, which causes it to begin to burn at very low temperatures
from friction in the gun barrel, made it an ideal radioactive gas weapon then
and now. Also it was more available because the amount of depleted uranium
produced was much greater than the amount of fission products produced in
1943.

Britain had thoughts of using poisoned gas on Iraq long before 1991:

"I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes.
The moral effect should be good... and it would spread a lively terror..."
(Winston Churchill commenting on the British use of poison gas against the
Iraqis after the First World War).

GUIDED WEAPONS SYSTEMS

Depleted uranium weapons were first given by the US to Israel for use under
US supervision in the 1973 Sinai war against the Arabs. Since then the US has
tested, manufactured, and sold depleted uranium weapons systems to 29
countries. An international taboo prevented their use until 1991, when the US
broke the taboo and used them for the first time, on the battlefields of Iraq
and Kuwait.

The US military admitted using depleted uranium projectiles in tanks and
planes, but warheads in missiles and bombs are classified or referred to as
a 'dense' or 'mystery metal'. Dai Williams, a researcher at the 2003 World
Depleted Uranium Weapons Conference, reported finding 11 US patents for
guided weapons systems with the term 'depleted uranium' or 'dense metal',
which from the density can only be depleted uranium or tungsten, in order to
fit the dimensions of the warhead.

Extensive carpet bombing, grid bombing, and the frequent use of missiles and
depleted uranium bullets on buildings in densely populated areas has occurred
in Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan. The discovery that bomb craters in
Yugoslavia in 1999 were radioactive, and that an unexploded missile in 1999
contained a depleted uranium warhead, implies that the total amount of
depleted uranium used since 1991 has been greatly underestimated. Of even
greater concern, is that 100 per cent of the depleted uranium in bombs and
missiles is aerosolized upon impact and immediately released into the
atmosphere. This amount can be as much as 1.5 tons in the large bombs. In
bullets and cannon shells, the amount aerosolized is 40-70 per cent, leaving
pieces and unexploded shells in the environment, to provide new sources of
radioactive dust and contamination of the groundwater from dissolved depleted
uranium metal long after the battles are over, as reported in a 2003 report
by the UN Environmental Program on Yugoslavia. Considering that the US has
admitted using 34 tons of depleted uranium from bullets and cannon shells in
Yugoslavia, and the fact that 35,000 NATO bombing missions occurred there in
1999, potentially the amount of depleted uranium contaminating Yugoslavia and
transboundary drift into surrounding countries is staggering.

Because of mysterious illnesses and post-war birth defects reported among
Gulf War veterans and civilians in southern Iraq, and radiation related
illnesses in UN Peacekeepers serving in Yugoslavia, growing concerns about
radiation effects and environmental damage has stirred up international
outrage about the use of radioactive weapons by the US after 1991. At the
2003 meeting of parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, discussing
the U.S. desire to maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile, the Hiroshima
Mayor Tadatoshi AKIBA stated,

"It is incumbent upon the rest of the world ... to stand up now and tell all
of our military leaders that we refuse to be threatened or protected by
nuclear weapons. We refuse to live in a world of continually recycled fear
and hatred".

ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW

Four reasons why using depleted uranium weapons violates the UN Convention on
Human Rights:

LEGALITY TEST FOR WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW

TEMPORAL TEST - Weapons must not continue to act after the battle is over.

ENVIRONMENTAL TEST - Weapons must not be unduly harmful to the environment.

TERRITORIAL TEST - Weapons must not act off of the battlefield.

HUMANENESS TEST - Weapons must not kill or wound inhumanly.

International Human Rights and humanitarian lawyer, Karen Parker, determined
that depleted uranium weaponry fails the four tests for legal weapons under
international law, and that it is also illegal under the definition of
a 'poison' weapon. Through Karen Parker's continued efforts, a sub-commission
of the UN Human Rights Commission determined in 1996 that depleted uranium is
a weapon of mass destruction that should not be used:

RESOLUTION 1996/16 ON STOPPING THE USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM - DU

The military use of DU violates current international humanitarian law,
including the principle that there is no unlimited right to choose the means
and methods of warfare (Art. 22 Hague Convention VI (HCIV); Art. 35 of the
Additional Protocol to the Geneva (GP1); the ban on causing unnecessary
suffering and superfluous injury (Art. 23 ¤le HCIV; Art. 35 ¤2 GP1),
indiscriminate warfare (Art. 51 ¤4c and 5b GP1) as well as the use of poison
or poisoned weapons.

The deployment and use of DU violate the principles of international
environmental and human rights protection. They contradict the right to life
established by the Resolution 1996/16 of the UN Subcommittee on Human Rights.

FOUR NUCLEAR WARS

Although restricted to battlefields in Iraq and Kuwait, the 1991 Gulf War was
one of the most toxic and environmentally devastating wars in world history.
Oil well fires, the bombing of oil tankers and oil wells which released
millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Arabia and desert, and the
devastation from tanks and heavy equipment destroyed the desert ecosystem.
The long term and far reaching effects, and dispersal of at least 340 tons of
depleted uranium weapons, had a global environmental effect. Smoke from the
oil fires was later found in deposits in South America, the Himalayas and
Hawaii. Large annual dust storms originating in North Africa, the Middle
East, and Central Asia will quickly spread the radioactive contamination
around the world, and weathering of old depleted uranium munitions on
battlefields and other areas will provide new sources of radioactive
contamination in future years. Downwind from the radioactive devastation in
Iraq, Israel is also suffering from large increases in breast cancer,
leukemia and childhood diabetes.

RADIATION RESPECTS NO BORDERS, NO SOCIOECONOMIC CLASS, AND NO RELIGION

The expendability of the sanctity of life to achieve US political ends was
described by US soldiers on the ground, and from the air, along the Highway
of Death in Iraq in 1991:

"Iraqi soldiers [whether they] be young boys or old men. They were a sad
sight, with absolutely no fight left in them. Their leaders had cut their
Achilles' tendons so they couldn't run away and then left them. What weapons
they had were in bad repair and little ammunition was on hand. They were
hungry, cold, and scared. The hate I had for any Iraqi dissipated. These
people had no business being on a battlefield." (S Hersh, New Yorker, May 22,
2000)

American pilots bombing and strafing, with depleted uranium weapons, helpless
retreating Iraqi soldiers who had already surrendered, exclaimed:

"We toasted him.... we hit the jackpot....a turkey shoot....shooting fish in
a barrel....basically just sitting ducks... There's just nothing like it.
It's the biggest Fourth of July show you've ever seen, and to see those tanks
just 'boom', and more stuff just keeps spewing out of them... they just
become white hot. It's wonderful." (L A Times and Washington Post, both
February 27, 1991)

Nearly 700,000 American Gulf War Veterans returned to the US from a war that
lasted just a few weeks. Today more than 240,000 of those soldiers are on
permanent medical disability, and over 11,000 are dead. In a US Government
study on post-Gulf War babies born to 251 veterans, 67 per cent of the babies
were reported to have serious illnesses or serious birth defects. They were
born without eyes, ears, had missing organs, fused fingers, thyroid or other
malfunctions. Depleted uranium in the semen of the soldiers internally
contaminated their wives. Severe birth defects have been reported in babies
born to contaminated civilians in Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan and the
incidence and severity of defects is increasing over time. Women in
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq are afraid now to have babies, and when they
do give birth, instead of asking if it is a girl or a boy, they ask 'is it
normal?'.

KNOWN ILLNESSES INFLICTED BY INTERNALIZATION OF DEPLETED URANIUM PARTICLES

Soldiers who served in Bradley fighting vehicles, where it was common to sit
on ammunition boxes where depleted uranium ammunition was stored, are now
reporting that many have rectal cancer.

For the first time, medical doctors in Yugoslavia and Iraq have reported
multiple in situ unrelated cancers developing in patients, and even in
families who are living in highly contaminated areas. Even stranger, they
report that cancer was unknown in previous generations. Very rare and unusual
cancers and birth defects have also been reported to be increasing above
normal levels prior to 1991, not only in war torn countries, but in
neighbouring countries from transboundary contamination.

Dr. Keith Baverstock, a senior radiation advisor who was on the staff of the
World Health Organization, co-authored a report in November 2001, warning
that the long-term health effects of depleted uranium would endanger Iraq's
civilian population, and that the dry climate would increase exposure from
the tiny particles blowing around and be inhaled for years to come. The WHO
refused to give him permission to publish the study, bowing to pressure from
the IAEA. Dr. Baverstock released the damning report to the media in February
2004. Pekka Haavisto, Chairman of the UN Environment Program's Post-Conflict
Assessment Unit in Geneva, shares Baverstock's anxiety about depleted uranium
but UNEP experts have not been allowed into Iraq to assess the pollution.

"DEPLETED URANIUM SCARE" - Claimed by President George W. Bush on the
official White House website:

"During the Gulf War, coalition forces used armor-piercing ammunition made
from depleted uranium, which is ideal for the purpose because of its great
density. In recent years, the Iraqi regime has made substantial efforts to
promote the false claim that the depleted uranium rounds fired by coalition
forces have caused cancers and birth defects in Iraq. Iraq has distributed
horrifying pictures of children with birth defects and linked them to
depleted uranium. The campaign has two major propaganda assets:"

"Uranium is a name that has frightening associations in the mind of the
average person, which makes the lie relatively easy to sell; and Iraq could
take advantage of an established international network of antinuclear
activists who had already launched their own campaign against depleted
uranium."

"But scientists working for the World Health Organization, the UN
Environmental Programme, and the European Union could find no health effects
linked to exposure to depleted uranium."

The US war in Afghanistan made it clear that this was not a war IN the third
world, but a war AGAINST the third world. In Afghanistan where 800 to 1000
tons of depleted uranium was estimated to have been used in 2001, even
uneducated Afghanis understand the impact these weapons have had on their
children and on future generations:

"After the Americans destroyed our village and killed many of us, we also
lost our houses and have nothing to eat. However, we would have endured these
miseries and even accepted them, if the Americans had not sentenced us all to
death. When I saw my deformed grandson, I realized that my hopes of the
future have vanished for good, different from the hopelessness of the Russian
barbarism, even though at that time I lost my older son Shafiqullah. This
time, however, I know we are part of the invisible genocide brought on us by
America, a silent death from which I know we will not escape." (Jooma Khan of
Laghman province, March 2003)

In 1990, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) wrote a report
warning about the potential health and environmental catastrophe from the use
of depleted uranium weapons. The health effects had been known for a long
time. The report sent to the UK government warned "in their estimation, if 50
tonnes of residual DU dust remained 'in the region' there could be half a
million extra cancers by the end of the century [2000]." Estimates of
depleted uranium weapons used in 1991, now range from the Pentagon's admitted
325 tons, to other scientific bodies who put the figure as high as 900 tons.
That would make the number of estimated cancers as high as 9,000,000,
depending on the amount used in the 1991 Gulf War. In the 2003 Gulf War,
estimates of 2200 tons have been given - causing about 22,000,000 new cancer
cases. Altogether the total number of cancer patients estimated using the
UKAEA data would be 25,250,000. In July of 1998, the CIA estimated the
population of Iraq to be approximately 24,683,313.

Ironically, the UN Resolution 661 calling for sanctions against Iraq, was
signed on Hiroshima Day, August 6, 1990.

THE PARALLELS

War can really cause no economic boom, at least not directly, since an
increase in wealth never does result from destruction of goods.
  Ludwig von Mises

The parallels between Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan are startlingly
similar. The weapons used, the unfair treaties offered by the US, and the
bombing and destruction of the environment and entire infrastructure. In
every city of Iraq and Yugoslavia, the television and radio stations were
bombed.

Educational centres were targeted, and stores where educational materials
were sold were destroyed on nearly the same day. Under UN sanctions, Iraq was
not even allowed pencils for schoolchildren. Cultural antiquities and
historical treasures were targeted and destroyed in all three countries, a
kind of cultural and historical cleansing, a collective national psychic
trauma.

The permanent radioactive contamination and environmental devastation of all
three countries is unprecedented, resulting in huge increases in cancer and
birth defects following the attacks. These will increase over time from
unknown effects due to chronic exposure, increasing internal levels of
radiation from depleted uranium dust, and permanent genetic effects passed on
to future generations. Clearly, this has been a genocidal plan from the start.

What has happened to Human Rights, to the Rights of the Child, to civil
society, and to common humanity?

It is up to the citizens of the world to stop the depleted uranium wars, and
future nuclear wars, causing irreversible devastation. There are just a few
generations left before the collapse of our environment, and then it will be
too late. We can be no healthier than the health of the environment - we
breathe the same air, drink the same water, eat food from the same soil.

"Our collective gene pool of life, evolving for hundreds of millions of years
has been seriously damaged in less than the past fifty. The time remaining to
reverse this culture of 'lemming death' is on the wane. In the future, what
will you tell our grandchildren about what you did in the prime of your life
to turn around this death process?" (Rosalie Bertell, 1982)

THE DEEPER PURPOSE: G*O*D* [Gold, Oil, and Drugs]

"We must become the owners, or at any rate the controllers at the source, of
at least a proportion of the oil which we require." (British Royal
Commission, agreeing with Winston Churchill's policy towards Iraq 1913).

"It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our
imports come from overseas." (US President George W. Bush, Beaverton, Oregon,
Sep. 25, 2000).

"If they turn on the radars we're going to blow up their goddamn SAMs
(surface-to-air missiles). They know we own their country. We own their
airspace... We dictate the way they live and talk. And that's what's great
about America right now. It's a good thing, especially when there's a lot of
oil out there we need."

(US Brig. General William Looney in 1999, referring to Iraq).

Millions of years ago, before India crashed into the Eurasian continent and
uplifted the Himalayas, the ancient shallow Tethys sea stretched from the
Atlantic across what is now the Mediterranean, Black, Caspian and Aral seas.
Rich oil deposits are now located where ancient life accumulated and 'cooked'
under just the right conditions to form large oil deposits in the ancient
sediments. Long before 1991, Unocal in Afghanistan, Amoco in Yugoslavia, and
various oil companies interested in Iraq oil deposits, had conducted
extensive exploration and characterisation of oil deposits in the Middle East
and Central Asian regions, including the northern half of India.

Britain has maintained an interest in Middle Eastern oil deposits for a
century, and has been the staunchest military partner of the US since the
first depleted uranium war in 1991 in Iraq. Germany, another military partner
in Yugoslavia with forces now in Afghanistan, was one of the major economic
beneficiaries of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the colonisation of the
Balkans. US interest in Yugoslavia had much to do with building pipelines
from Central Asia to the Mediterranean warm water ports in Yugoslavia. A
silent and hidden partnership between the US and Japan provided large amounts
of cash from Japan to finance the 1991 Iraq and 1995/1999 Yugoslavian wars,
with additional help in Afghanistan by providing not only cash, but fuel for
the war, from Aegis warships of the Japanese Self Defense Forces in the
Indian Ocean. Nippon Steel, Mitsubishi, and Halliburton are now partners in a
Central Asian oil pipeline project. In 2004, despite much citizen opposition
in Japan, the Japanese government has sent Self Defense Forces to Iraq
for 'reconstruction'. This action taken by the Japanese government, of
placing troops on the ground in a war zone, will lead to rescinding Article 9
of the Japanese Constitution, which forever prohibits military aggression by
Japan.

THE IRON TRIANGLE (all under one roof): MILITARY, BIG BUSINESS, POLITICS

The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of
private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic
State itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism -- ownership of government by
an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.

  Franklin Delano Roosevelt

But what do oil, military partners, depleted uranium wars, and US foreign
policy have to do with nuclear weapons? The answer came to me in 1991 when I
became a whistleblower at the Livermore Nuclear Weapons Laboratory near San
Francisco, California. Richard Berta, the Western Regional Inspector for the
Department of Energy, told me "The Pentagon exists for the oil companies...
and the nuclear weapons labs exist for the Pentagon."

Depleted uranium was used beginning in 1991 for three reasons: To test the
radiobiological effects of 4th generation nuclear weapons, which are still
under development To blur and break down the distinction between conventional
and nuclear weapons To make it easier to reintroduce nuclear weapons into the
US military arsenal

Today, the US is number one in 4th generation nuclear weapons research and
development, followed by Japan and Germany tied for number two, and Russia
and other countries follow.

The Carlyle Group, a private massive equity firm, the 12th largest defense
business with an obscenely high profit margin, is a business "arrangement"
between the Bush and Bin Laden families, wealthy Saudis, former British Prime
Minister John Major, James Baker III, Afsaneh Masheyekhi, Frank Carlucci,
Colin Powell, other former US Government administrators, and Madeleine
Albright's daughter. The Carlyle Group is the 'gatekeeper' to the Saudi
investment community. It owns 70 percent of Lockheed Martin Marietta, the
largest military contractor in the US, and because Carlyle is privately
owned, has no scrutiny or accountability whatsoever. A journalist who calls
himself 'a skunk at the garden party' described investigating the Carlyle
Group, he said 'it's like shadow boxing with a ghost'. The Group hires as
lobbyists the best known politicians from around the world, in order to
influence the politics of war, and privately profit from their previous
public policies. The conflict of interest is obvious: President George W.
Bush is creating wars as his father, former President George Bush, is
globally peddling weapons and "protection". Lockheed Martin Marietta now owns
Sandia Laboratories, a private contractor that makes the trigger for nuclear
weapons, with a Sandia laboratory facility across the street from Los Alamos
and Livermore National Laboratories, where the nuclear bombs are made.

At the May 2003 University of California Regents meeting which I attended,
Admiral Linton Brooks was present and newly in charge of the nuclear weapons
programme under the Department of Energy. Admiral Brooks informed California
Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and the UC Regents that the management contract
for the nuclear weapons laboratories, held unchallenged by the University of
California for over 60 years, will be put up for competitive bid in 2005. The
favoured institution, with a faculty member on the 'blue ribbon committee'
making the contract award, is the University of Texas. This privatisation and
management contract transfer of the US nuclear weapons programme will put
control of the US nuclear weapons programme close to the Carlyle Group. The
incestuous relationship between the US government, private companies, and the
Bush and Bin Laden families in a way answers many of the lingering questions
in everyone's minds about many of the ill fated decisions and policies that
have been implemented.

Leuren Moret has worked at two US nuclear weapons laboratories as a
geoscientist. In 1991 she became a whistleblower at the Livermore nuclear
weapons lab, and since then has worked as an independent citizen scientist
and radiation specialist in communities around the world, and contributed to
the UN subcommission investigating depleted uranium. Her research on the
environmental and public health effects of low level radiation from
atmospheric testing fallout, nuclear power plants, and depleted uranium
weaponry, is available on the internet and at http://www.mindfully.org. In
2003, she testified at the International Criminal Tribunal for Afghanistan
held in Japan, and presented at the World Depleted Uranium Weapons Conference
in Hamburg, Germany, and at the World Court of Women at the World Social
Forum in Bombay, India in January 2004. She is a Contributing Editor to
GLOBAL OUTLOOK, a City of Berkeley Environmental Commissioner, and the Past

  PRN: Chernobyl Study Reveals First Direct
Evidence That Risk of
Thyroid Cancer Rises With Increasing Radiation
Dose

http://www.fhcrc.org"
TITLE="http://www.fhcrc.org">

SEATTLE, Sept. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- The risk of
thyroid cancer
rises with increasing radiation dose, according to
the most
thorough risk analysis for thyroid cancer to date
among people
who grew up in the shadow of the 1986 Chernobyl
power-plant
disaster.

The incidence of thyroid cancer was 45 times
greater among
those who received the highest radiation dose as
compared to
those in the lowest-dose group, according to a
team of American
and Russian researchers led by Scott Davis, Ph.D.,
and colleagues
at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. They
report their
findings in the September issue of Radiation
Research.

"This is the first study of its kind to establish
a
dose-response relationship between radiation dose
from Chernobyl
and thyroid cancer," said Davis, referring to the
observation
that as radiation doses increase, so does the risk
of thyroid
cancer. "We found a significant increased risk of
thyroid cancer
among people exposed as children to radiation from
Chernobyl, and
that the risk increased as a function of radiation
dose."

Having such information in hand, Davis said, may
help
officials better predict what long-term health
effects to expect
in the event of a similar nuclear accident or
terrorist attack.

"Another potential benefit of the findings is that
it allows
officials to more accurately understand and
document the
magnitude of the thyroid-cancer burden that has
resulted from
Chernobyl. This information will be important in
designing and
maintaining programs targeted toward the victims
of the
disaster."

While about 30 people were killed immediately from
the blast,
which remains the worst accident of its kind in
history, an
estimated 5 million people were exposed to the
resulting
radiation.

"Prior to Chernobyl, thyroid cancer in children
was
practically nonexistent. Today we see dozens and
dozens of cases
a year in the regions contaminated by the
disaster, and the
incidence continues to rise," Davis said. "This
provides some
evidence that there's an excess of thyroid cancer
in children and
in people who were children at the time of the
accident. However
until now nobody had taken the next step to find
out just how
much a risk there is and whether it rises along
with radiation
dose."

While previous Chernobyl studies have relied on
broad-stroke
estimates of radiation exposure based on such
factors as ground
contamination, geographic proximity to the
northern Ukraine plant
or other surrogate measures of exposure, this
study is the first
of its kind to factor into the equation
individualized estimates
of radiation dose based on in-person interviews
about diet and
other lifestyle factors, said Davis, a member of
Fred
Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division.

"After all these years, many efforts have been
made by
various research groups around the world to study
the health
effects of Chernobyl, and hundreds of scientific
papers have been
published. But ours is the first report that
provides
quantitative estimates of thyroid-cancer risk in
relation to
individual estimates of radiation dose," said
Davis, also
chairman of the Department of Epidemiology at the
University of
Washington School of Public Health and Community
Medicine in
Seattle.

Kenneth Kopecky, Ph.D., a biostatistician in Fred
Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division, was
the study's
co-investigator and directed the data analysis.
Public Health
Sciences Division staff managed and coordinated
all aspects of
the project. They included Theresa Taggart
(project manager),
Lynn Onstad (statistician), Teri Kopp
(administration) and Laurie
Shields (research coordinator).

The Fred Hutchinson team organized a collaborative
effort
with a dozen scientists at four Russian
institutions to conduct
this research: the Medical Radiological Research
Center (in
Obninsk), the Byransk Diagnostic Center and the
Bryansk Institute
of Pathology (both in Bryansk), and the National
Center of
Hematology (in Moscow). All investigators were
members of the
International Consortium for Research on the
Health Effects of
Radiation funded by the U.S. Office of Naval
Research.

The researchers focused their efforts on western
part of the
Bryansk Oblast of Russia. This region, located
about 66 miles
northeast of Chernobyl, is the most heavily
contaminated area in
the Russian Federation. This was the first study
of this type
among residents of the Russian Federation exposed
to Chernobyl
radiation.

Working through a local cancer registry, the
researchers
identified 26 people with thyroid cancer who were
less than 20
years old when the Chernobyl accident occurred;
the majority were
under 16 when their thyroid cancers were
diagnosed. They then
identified 52 healthy control subjects from the
general
population for comparison purposes. The controls
and cancer cases
were matched by age and place of residence at the
time of the
accident.

The researchers then set about collecting
information from
these individuals and their mothers or fathers
that would allow
them to estimate each person's radiation dose
using computer
models. Interviews took place in the home and were
conducted by
Russian physicians.

Individual doses depended largely on the ingestion
patterns
of food contaminated with radioactive iodine-131
(I-131), which
concentrates in the thyroid gland. The primary
source of
food-based I-131 was milk from cows that grazed on
contaminated
pastures. Radiation doses to the thyroid increased
along with the
amount of milk and dairy products consumed.
External, airborne
radiation and contamination of other foods also
contributed
somewhat to the overall dose, depending on the
person's proximity
to the plant at the time of the accident. These
doses were all
received within the first few months after the
accident, before
the I-131 in the environment decayed into
non-radioactive
elements. While other radioactive contaminants
remain in the
area, they do not cause appreciable doses of
radiation to the
thyroid.

In addition to the study's ability to estimate
individual
radiation doses based on personal interviews,
other strengths of
the study included the fact that all cases of
thyroid cancer were
confirmed independently by a panel of expert
pathologists, and
the study focused on people exposed as young
children and
adolescents, a group that is likely to be most
susceptible to the
effects of radiation exposure to the thyroid
gland. Limitations
of the study included its small sample size and
its reliance on
individual recall for reporting factors such as
milk-consumption
patterns that were used to estimate radiation
dose.

Efforts are under way to investigate a larger
population in a
similar fashion to see if these findings can be
replicated, Davis
said.

For his contributions to the field, earlier this
year Davis
became the first foreign epidemiologist elected to
the Russian
Academy of Medical Sciences. The group's status in
that country
is on a par with the esteemed National Academy of
Sciences in the
United States. In May he received an honorary
diploma in Moscow.

Davis and colleagues have extended their
cancer-risk studies
to older Chernobyl survivors and are investigating
how the damage
caused to DNA by radiation influences the risk of
developing
thyroid cancer.

This work is part of Fred Hutchinson's Global
Health
Initiative, which focuses on international
collaboration to
understand and solve some of the most widespread
health problems
in the world, including cancer and infectious
diseases.

SIDEBAR

IT ALL STARTED WITH A RUSSIAN HELICOPTER PILOT WHO
WAS
TREATED FOR LEUKEMIA AT FRED HUTCHINSON

Providing some long-awaited answers to Chernobyl
survivors
has been a rewarding research endeavor for Scott
Davis, Ph.D.,
and colleagues at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, but it
hasn't been a straightforward one.

Some of the team's greatest achievements were
simply
establishing the working relationships and
infrastructure to get
the studies off the ground.

"Within the first year of the 1986 accident, we
were very
interested in seeing if we could get involved and
participate in
long-term studies of health effects," Davis said.
"But at the
time of the accident, our government and that of
the former
Soviet Union were not so friendly, so establishing
connections
through that route didn't work."

But in 1990, an opportunity surfaced when a
Russian
helicopter pilot involved in the initial efforts
to contain the
Chernobyl radiation developed leukemia and came to
Fred
Hutchinson for a bone-marrow transplant. After his
treatment, an
informal exchange program began between Fred
Hutchinson and the
National Center for Hematology in Moscow, whose
director
approached the center for assistance in developing
a research and
treatment institute for victims of the accident.
Davis and
colleague Kenneth Kopecky, Ph.D., made their first
trip to Moscow
that year.

Then, in 1992, the Soviet Union collapsed. "We
were back to
square one in terms of negotiations," Davis said.

But, thanks to efforts by Fred Hutchinson's
then-president
and director, Robert W. Day, M.D., and by the late
Adm. Elmo
Zumwalt, a former center trustee and former chief
of naval
operations for the U.S. Navy, new relationships
were established.
In 1992, a research consortium consisting of three
international
teams working in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine was
created to study
long-term health effects of the radiation released
at Chernobyl.

"Our initial work in Russia was simply to conduct
small pilot
studies to establish in concrete terms whether we
could carry out
all phases of an epidemiological study," Davis
said. "There was
no history of doing this kind of research in
Russia or the other
two countries. We had to set it all up from
scratch."

Challenges included purchasing Russian vehicles
for the field
teams using federal dollars -- an unprecedented
bureaucratic
challenge for the researchers -- importing all
laboratory
equipment and supplies, and then figuring out a
way to maintain
them without the standard resources that one takes
for granted in
the United States.

"It's been a long haul and an enormous amount of
time and
work," Davis said, whose 30-plus trips to the
former Soviet Union
include walking the grounds of the evacuated plant
and surveying
the desolated 30-kilometer evacuation zone.

Once the team established the capability to do the
research,
the group began its studies of thyroid cancer, a
disease linked
to radiation exposure. By the early 1990s, many
new cases of the
disease, particularly among young children, were
diagnosed in
regions near the blast. Since then, reports show
several hundred
cases of thyroid cancer in young children in the
three countries
contaminated by Chernobyl, a trend that appears to
be continuing.

Despite the lack of resources available to
initiate these
studies, Davis said that scientists and citizens
of the three
countries were eager for the research from the
start. "Our
collaborators in Russia have been terrific
colleagues," he said.
"We now have very close ties with our partner
institutions."

He also credited the strong encouragement and
support from
Fred Hutchinson's senior administration for
helping him establish
stable working relationships with their overseas
colleagues.

"The incredible support and flexibility of the
center,
especially in the early stages, really made this
happen. That
can't be overstated," Davis said.

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home of
two Nobel
laureates, is an independent, nonprofit research
institution
dedicated to the development and advancement of
biomedical
technology to eliminate cancer and other
potentially fatal
diseases. Fred Hutchinson receives more funding
from the National
Institutes of Health than any other independent
U.S. research
center. Recognized internationally for its
pioneering work in
bone-marrow transplantation, the center's four
scientific
divisions collaborate to form a unique environment
for conducting
basic and applied science. Fred Hutchinson, in
collaboration with
its clinical and research partners, the University
of Washington
Academic Medical Center and Children's Hospital
and Regional
Medical Center, is the only National Cancer
Institute-designated
comprehensive cancer center in the Pacific
Northwest and is one
of 38 nationwide. For more information, visit the

Rochester Time:1:13 pm		10-20-2004

Plutonium from UR revealed in Niagara
  
Corydon Ireland, Staff writer- cireland@democratandchronicle.com

(October 19, 2004) Ñ LEWISTON Ñ About 90 miles west of Rochester, in rural
Niagara County, is a historical remnant of the University of Rochester's role
in the making of the atom bomb.

It doesn't look like much: a cattail marsh 21 feet by 21 feet in size, within
an undulant field of weeds and wildflowers. But the so-called University of
Rochester Burial Area is in the heart of what used to be a 12-square-mile
military site. In 1943, part of that site was turned over to the Manhattan
Project, the top-secret federal operation that created the atomic bomb.

 In those days, UR did research on the health effects of radiation, using the
remote Niagara County burial area to entomb the remains of thousands of
laboratory animals contaminated by radiation, including more than 270,000
mice. Artifacts of darker UR experiments Ñ some injecting unwitting patients
at Strong Memorial Hospital with plutonium Ñ were apparently also buried there.

The site was investigated and cleaned up by the U.S. Department of Energy 30
years ago. But a 2002 investigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Ñ made
public this year, with a report due this fall Ñ turned up plutonium and other
radioactive metals.

 The corps, the federal authority for cleaning up such sites, said that the
traces of radioactivity found were not enough to have endangered human health
or the environment. But they are enough to warrant further investigation.

 (UR is not liable, because the radioactive material was part of a federally
financed program, the Manhattan Project.)

 Finding radioactive metals at the UR Burial Area Ñ a site supposedly long ago
cleaned up Ñ has sounded a major chord of concern in Niagara County.
It was a sign to many that the federal government has not adequately
investigated radiation at the former military site known as the Lake Ontario
Ordnance Works.

Lewiston resident Lou Ricciuti, who thinks of Niagara County as "an atomic
wasteland," called the UR Burial Area "fascinating and frightening."

 Finding radioactive metals at the UR Burial Area Ñ a site supposedly long ago
cleaned up Ñ has sounded a major chord of concern in Niagara County.

It was a sign to many that the federal government has not adequately
investigated radiation at the former military site known as the Lake Ontario
Ordnance Works.

Lewiston resident Lou Ricciuti, who thinks of Niagara County as "an atomic
wasteland," called the UR Burial Area "fascinating and frightening."

 The one-time Niagara Falls tourism expert has been studying nuclear
contamination in his home county for four years, compiling 50 cubic feet of
documents.

 Other residents say that if radioactive metals were found in the tiny UR
burial area, they could be elsewhere Ñ buried and forgotten, or missed in
earlier federal investigations and cleanups.
To the west just more than a mile is the Niagara River, to the north, Lake
Ontario.

"The federal government hasn't done its job" investigating radioactivity in
the area, said William Choboy, a member of the Lewiston Town Board.

 Part of the old ordnance works site, once 7,500 acres, is still in federal
hands. Included is the 191-acre Niagara Falls Storage Site, one of about 20
former U.S. military installations contaminated with bomb-related radioactive
waste. Buried there is 22,000 tons of radioactive waste, including one-third
of the world's supply of mined uranium.

 But most of the ordnance works site Ñ 5,000 acres, including the forgotten UR
burial area Ñ was sold back to private interests starting in 1945. Buying it
up were farmers, developers and even a school district.

The Lewiston-Porter Central School District campus, on the southwest edge of
the former ordnance site, was where Tim Henderson went to school in the 1960s.
Now a water-treatment worker, he put two children through school on the same
campus and today has a grandson there.

"There is plenty to be feared" about the site, he said, including more buried
radioactive waste hinted at by the UR burial area.

At a public meeting this summer about the radiation find, Henderson said, a
thousand people turned out.

 'Lightning rod'
 The UR burial area is on an unused portion of a 710-acre landfill now owned
by CWM Chemical Services LLC, a subsidiary of Houston-based Waste Management Inc. 

Dick Sturgis, CWM district manager, said the radiation found at the UR burial
area "was so small it was difficult to gather a sample for analysis."

 But the long-forgotten UR site "has become a lightning rod" on radiation
issues, said William Rolland, who lives in Porter, on a creek downwind and
downstream from CWM.

The discovery not only focused local criticism on the government, he said, but
also it focused attention on CWM, the only commercial hazardous waste landfill
in the Northeast. It takes in high-level toxic waste from 30 states and
Canada, as well as other foreign customers.

 Add in radioactive waste, said Rolland, and CWM's toxic waste business
becomes an issue of environmental justice. That's a principle in the federal
and state law that says waste sites should be distributed equitably.

The retired engineer is secretary of Residents for Responsible Government, a
Niagara County group calling for radiological testing of CWM land near the UR
burial area.

 Sturgis said a plan for radiological monitoring on the site is being designed
with state health officials and will include the monitoring of soil, surface
water, groundwater and air.

But any cleanup of the old ordnance property, he said, is a federal
responsibility.

 Linda Shaw, a Rochester environmental lawyer, said local ire should focus on
the federal government and not CWM.

She represents Eileen Syms of Grand Island, Erie County, who with her husband,
John, bought part of the old ordnance site in 1970. But Syms has not been able
to use the land since 1973 because of radiation contamination not revealed
during the sale.

Thirty years later, said Shaw, the federal government "has still not fully
investigated" the ordnance site.

The UR burial area is a signal that more radioactive waste is there to be
found, she said. "It's minor, but it's uncontained."

 The corps' discovery
 In May and September of 2002, contractors working for the corps' Buffalo
district office used a hand-drawn map from the 1950s to locate the old UR
burial area.

They excavated 300 feet of ground in six trenches as deep as 12 feet. Found
were traces of plutonium, strontium and uranium. The traces were peppered
through laboratory debris, including an animal bone, old lab gloves, glass
slides, syringes Ñ and an emesis basin, a device used in hospitals to catch
and contain human vomit.
James Karsten, a project manager at the corps' Corps' Buffalo district office,
called the dig results "not surprising." 

The plutonium and other debris was too little and buried too deep, and on land
too remote to be harmful, he said.

 UR officials are cautious.

"The people living near that site have the right to know what materials were
buried there, and what risks they may pose," said UR spokesman Christopher
DiFrancesco.

In 2002, UR provided historical information to the corps "to help them answer
those questions," he added, "and we'll continue to provide any assistance they
ask for."

Surface soil at the site, according to a corps fact sheet, "exhibited
near-background" radiation levels. The buried material, once uncovered, was 20
to 80 times higher than background levels normally found from natural
radiation sources. These would be harmful only after prolonged close contact.

 The artifacts are hot enough to be "noteworthy from a regulatory standpoint,"
said radiation expert P. Andrew Karam, a research assistant professor of
biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

"But this is not going to hurt anyone," he said, "unless people are over there
munching on small animal bones and soil."
The corps agrees that the radioactive find was significant enough to warrant
more investigation, and this year applied for additional federal funding.

Karam was UR's radiation safety officer in 2002, when the corps investigation
was under way. He called the isotopes found "consistent with research that
took place at (UR) under the Manhattan Project."

The recovered material is now stored in drums at the Niagara Falls Storage
Site, awaiting final disposal in Texas.

In the right foreground is the cattail marsh in Lewiston, Niagara County that
was once the University of Rochester's Burial Area. 

 The UR burial area

 It was used from 1944 to 1953 to dump radioactive laboratory wastes from UR
research facilities.
 It's part of a 30-acre former military site, one of three contiguous areas
where radioactive contamination is suspected by the U.S. Department of Energy.
 In 1972, 512 cubic yards of soil, drums and debris were removed from there by
the DOEand likely stored at the nearby Niagara Falls Storage Site.
 In 2002, prompted by citizen concerns, a new investigation uncovered traces
of plutonium-239, plutonium-240, radium-226, thorium-230, strontium-90,
actinium-227, uranium 233/234, uranium 235/236 and uranium-238. Only the
plutonium and strontium are historically associated with UR.
 There were eight traces of plutonium. The man-made radioactive metal, first
made in 1941 and secret until 1948, was used to make nuclear weapons,
including the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. It is highly
toxic if inhaled.
 The radioactive half-life of just the two isotopes of plutonium found in
Niagara County is 24,100 years (Pu-239) and 6,560 years (Pu-240). "Half-life"
is a term used to quantify the natural decay of radioactive isotopes.
Plutonium-239, for instance, will lose half its radiological potency in that
period of time.

 Background
 During the years 1945 and 1946, 11 unwitting patients at UR's Strong Memorial
Hospital were injected with soluble plutonium, a man-made radioactive metal
used to make atomic bombs. The seven women and four men ranged in age from 18
to 68. All are dead, though none apparently as a result of the experiment,
which was intended to help establish safe levels of exposure to the metal.
A 12th patient, 24-year-old Mary Jean Connell, was injected with uranium salts
in 1946 during an experiment intended to see how much of the material was
needed to damage the kidneys. The retired factory worker is still alive and
living in Livonia, Livingston County.
In November 1996, the federal government agreed to pay $4.8 million to 12
families affected by such experiments, including nine from the Rochester area.
A federal advisory panel then investigating human radiation experiments found
evidence of at least 436 "experiment series" done by the U.S. Department of
Energy and its predecessors from 1944 to 1974. There were at least 10,000
subjects in 4,000 separate experiments.
To read 1994-1996 coverage of the plutonium experiment, the federal lawsuit
and the settlement, log on to DemocratandChronicle.com and click on this story.

Perceptions of harm
 There are two main activist groups in Niagara County concerned about
radiological contamination on the former Lake Ontario Ordnance Works, a
12-square-mile section of the county. Neither claims harm from long-buried
radiation at the University of Rochester Burial Area, located within the
works. But both Residents for Responsible Government (from Porter) and
Residents Organized for Lew-Port's Environment (from Lewiston) say the
discovery points to the need for a comprehensive federal investigation of the
site, which is now largely back in private hands.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the agency investigating similar old
military sites nationwide, says the radiation in the UR burial area was too
little and too remote to have done harm. But it says the find was enough to
warrant further investigation of adjacent land.

 Legislators want to deliberate on waste traffic



The Associated Press Publication Date: 11/19/04

AUSTIN - A state senator said Thursday that the Legislature needs to
have a say in a company's bid to accept millions of pounds of
radioactive material from U.S. weapons programs.

Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, sent a letter last month to the Texas
Department of State Health Services asking officials to delay decisions
that would affect Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists' bid until
lawmakers had a chance to review the issue. The Legislature meets in
January.

"A decision to accept this quantity and quality of radioactive waste
involves numerous policy decisions that need to be carefully weighed by
the Legislature and all appropriate state agencies," Duncan wrote as he
laid out a series of questions and concerns he had on the issue.

Waste Control Specialists wants to store and dispose of the material,
mostly uranium mill tailings, at a site in Andrews County, where it
already treats, monitors and stores low-level radioactive material.

Waste Control Specialists has asked the state health agency for a
license to dispose of the uranium tailings. It also wants its state
license amended to expand the amount of radioactive material that can be
stored.

Lawmakers likely will have time to discuss the issue because the
department's technical review of the company's application for a
disposal license is not expected to be finished before September.

Duncan said the Waste Control Specialists proposal calls for storing and
disposing of as much as 153.6 million pounds of the material, which
would fill more than 700 railcars with a volume of more than 1.2 million
cubic feet.

He claims the material is substantially more radioactive with a longer
half-life than the low-level radioactive waste that could go to the
Andrews site under legislation lawmakers approved last year.

The company objected to Duncan's delay request and said it is not true
that the material will be substantially more radioactive than the law
allows. Kent Hance, an attorney for Waste Control Specialists, also
noted that the company received a license in 1997 to authorize the
receipt, storage and processing of radioactive material.

"An unbiased, scientific analysis will show that the WCS facility is an
appropriate regulatory and environmental alternative for the management
of this material and WCS hopes the DOE will consider its facility,"
Hance wrote in a letter to the health department.

The material is now at a site owned by the U.S. Department of Energy in
Ohio. The energy department is looking for companies that could store
and dispose of the material.

Four other states approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
dispose of the uranium tailings have rejected the material, Duncan said.
His office said the states are Utah, Illinois, Colorado and Washington.

 Company plans bid for storage of federal uranium waste
10-22-04
 By Ruth Campbell Odessa American

 Waste Control Specialists has applied to the Department of State Health
 Services to amend its license so it can store uranium tailings from a
 former U.S. Department of Energy uranium processing plant in Fernald,
 Ohio.

 The Department of Energy wants to move the waste by the end of 2006,
 said Gary Stegner, public affairs officer for the Department of Energy.

 Jeff Wagner, public affairs officer for Fluor Fernald, the company
 charged with cleaning up the Fernald site, said a request for proposals
 will be mailed out the first part of November and a contract should be
 awarded by Jan. 20, 2005.

 Shipping would start sometime in early 2005 Ñ around February or March,
 Wagner said.

 Waste Control Specialists, which has a site in Andrews County, has a
 license to store low-level radioactive waste and is applying to the
 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to dispose of low-level
 radioactive waste.

 Waste Control Specialists already stores waste similar to the waste at
 Fernald at its site, Reggie Bashur, a company consultant said. "The
 site and storage of the material will be fully protective of human
 health and the environment," Bashur said.

 Andrews business people and city and county officials wrote to U.S.
 Secretary of Energy Spence Abraham expressing support for Waste Control
 Specialists taking the Fernald waste.

 "The citizens of Andrews are very familiar with the nature of the
 business activities conducted at the WCS facility and understand that
 the facility is ideally situated for the safe and secure storage of
 radioactive materials due to the isolated location, arid climate, lack
 of surface and groundwater and superior geology," the letter says.

 "Additionally, all activities conducted at the WCS facility are
 strictly regulated by the environmental and radiation control agencies
 of the State of Texas and federal government," the letter said.

 The waste would come from Fernald's three silos, built in the early
 1950s near Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally, the Department of Energy was
 going to send the silo waste to the Nevada Test Site, Stegner said. But
 the State of Nevada has threatened to sue DOE if silo waste is sent
 there, so DOE is considering other options.

 The material is being moved because it would pose a public health
 threat if the silos collapsed and people were directly exposed to the
 material for long periods of time, according to information from Fluor
 Fernald, the company charged with cleaning up the Fernald site. The
 current location is also above a sole-source drinking water aquifer and
 within 25 miles of millions of people, the information says.

 The silos are concrete structures 80 feet in diameter and 30 feet high.
 The silos contain material left after the processing of naturally
 occurring uranium to produce uranium metal.

 Material left after the processing of uranium ore is regulated by the
 State of Texas under an authorization from the U.S. Regulatory
 Commission. The original ore was rich in uranium, and as a result, the
 material left behind "has relatively higher concentrations of naturally
 occurring radionulides than found in average ores," according to
 information from Fluor Fernald.

 Silos 1 and 2 contain about 8,000 cubic yards of silty clay-like
 material from the processing ore from the Belgian Congo in the early
 1950s, Fluor's information says.

 Margot Clarke, outreach coordinator for the Lone Star Chapter of the
 Sierra Club in Austin, said Belgian Congo Pitch Blend is 65 percent
 uranium.

 The material was processed at Fernald and at a facility in St. Louis.
 The residues were stored because the African Metals Corp., which owned
 the material, wanted to save them for additional processing that never
 happened, the information says.

 Clarke said the Fernald waste is known as 11e.2. "It's mine tailings
 from the most potent uranium in the world É much, much stronger than
 anything else," Clarke said.

 Silo 3 contains 5,100 cubic yards of powder-like residues from the
 processing of Canadian and U.S. ores from the 50s. The material has
 been calcinated Ñburned Ñ to reduce its volume, the information says.

 If granted, the amended license would allow Waste Control Specialists
 to increase the quantity of waste it can take from 250,000 cubic feet
 to 1.5 million cubic feet, said Richard Ratliff, radiation program
 officer for the Division of Regulatory Services in the Department of
 Health Services in Austin.

 The increased quantity would be the equivalent of about 7,000
 Department of Energy containers made of stainless steel and standing 6
 feet around and 6 1/2 feet tall, Ratliff said.

 Sue Walpole, public affairs officer with Fluor Fernald, said the
 company was given authority to look for other sites to send the waste.
 She said about 85 percent of the waste would stay at Fernald and be
 disposed of on-site.

 Stegner said two sets of requests for proposals will be taken Ñ one for
 waste from the Fernald plant and the other for waste Fernald stored.

 For transport, material in Silos 1 and 2 will be placed into transfer
 storage tanks, treated with a concrete grout, placed in one-half-inch
 steel sealed containers six feet in diameter and six-and-a-half feet
 high. The containers would be shipped by truck or rail.

 Radiation risks from the material are "being eliminated" through
 treatment and packaging, the information says.

 The containers have been drop tested to ensure their integrity in a
 transportation accident.

 Material in Silo 3 will be removed and conditioned with water and
 chemicals to make it "soil-like" and "eliminate its dispersability."
 After that, the material would be placed in Department of
 Transportation approved containers and shipped by truck or train to the
 Nevada Test Site.

 Clarke said the State of Utah took legislative action to stop the
 company, Envirocare, from taking the waste.

 "Once the DOE gets that stuff out of Ohio, É it's going to be nearly
 impossible for us to change our minds," Clarke said.

 Meanwhile, Clarke said the Sierra Club is working to close the "compact
 loophole," which allows waste from other states to be stored in Texas.

 The Waste Control site, once it's licensed, would store federal and
 compact waste from Texas and Vermont. Clarke said the loophole in the
 compact law allows the yet-to-be appointed six-member Compact
 Commission to vote to take waste from anyone.

 Clarke said Nevada has already proposed sending their interstate
 compact waste to Texas, as has Nebraska, which was supposed to be the
 host state for waste from Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana.

Guest Column: Texas shouldn't waste radioactive waste potential

By Ray Ashley
Opinion

Today there is interest in storing low-level radioactive waste in Texas.

Where will this lead and what benefits can result? How do the potential risks
compare with other familiar materials that routinely are brought into or
travel through the state?

According to an Oct. 8 Associated Press story, "Texas looks into storing
nuclear waste," the firm Waste Control Specialists has an operating
non-nuclear hazardous waste storage facility in Andrews County. If it obtains
a contract to store millions of pounds of low-level radioactive waste
generated during the 1940s, it plans to use that facility.

This material is composed entirely of radioactive uranium tailings left from
processing uranium ore for the former nuclear program. This material is
classified on a scale with many other familiar hazardous materials that we
accept as part of daily life. Many are destined for use in the state (certain
chemicals, gasoline, liquid natural gas, to name a few) or pass through to
out-of-state destinations.

According to the AP, environmental groups already are opposed, raising some of
the same arguments successfully used in their campaign to disallow additional,
limited drilling for new oil fields in Alaska. In hindsight, if that drilling
had been allowed, perhaps the price being paid today for a barrel of oil
wouldn't be $54, and continuing to increase, and low-test gasoline wouldn't be
selling for $1.90 per gallon.

Many environmental arguments have been used against construction of a new and
improved pipeline to carry oil from Alaska to the contiguous states. One
argument was that land to be used for pipeline construction would interfere
with continued growth of caribou herds. Thus, a higher priority was given to
protecting caribou than satisfying some of the nation's needs.

The AP story quoted Margot Clark, environmentalist outreach coordinator for
the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club, long-recognized as a leader in the
environmental movement, as saying that tailings are "very dangerous." What she
fails to address is that risks due to accidents involving tailings are much
less than from many other hazardous materials routinely transported within the
U.S.

Notably, a big part of the state approval process is to assess the safety of
local storage plans.

The national need for an adequate storage capacity for low-level radioactive
waste is totally separate from the issue of having a high-level radioactive
waste repository in Nevada, such as that proposed for Yucca Mountain. There,
radioactivity levels would be many multiples of 10 greater than at a low-level
radioactive waste storage site.

The lack of low-level radioactive waste storage sites (or of sufficient
storage capacity) could lead to a national catastrophe. Were that to occur,
two serious impacts would result: Physicians would no longer be able to use
radioactive isotopes in patient treatment, forcing the use of archaic methods,
and industrial research using radioactivity also would end, thus depriving the
nation of the development of new or improved products, many of which result in
making life easier and/or cheaper.

Raising a related matter, there is the possibility for Texas to replace Yucca
Mountain. A series of recent events, including legal and budgetary, lead to a
possibility of the project coming to a premature end in early fiscal year
2005. That being the case, it's in the nation's best interest to identify a
replacement site as soon as possible and initiate the activities to make it
happen.

It's well known that the future of nuclear power rests on having a place to
send its spent fuel. Financiers will not invest in new nuclear power plants
unless a long-term high-level radioactive waste storage capability exists. The
alternative is to continue to store the spent fuel on site at each plant.

This is a less secure arrangement (against terrorist actions) than sending
this waste to a single location for safe storage.

Since Deaf Smith County (in Texas) was one of the three site finalists vying
for selection as the nation's high-level radioactive waste storage facility,
it would be one logical choice for replacing the Yucca Mountain site.

However, considering the persistence of, and cost for defending against the
likes (scope and magnitude) of Nevada's opposition to both the Yucca Mountain
Project and its site, a necessary prerequisite for offering the Deaf Smith
County site is to first obtain strong support from both state and federal
administrations.

Imagine Texas as the nation's kingpin for radioactive waste storage. The
resulting substantial revenues could be used to augment many of the state's
tax-subsidized programs, including social, medical and educational.

Waste Control schedules meeting
Company wants to build hazardous waste storage units in Andrews County

Odessa American


ANDREWS Waste Control Specialists, which stores low-level radioactive
waste in Andrews County, has scheduled a public meeting on a request to
change its hazardous waste permit.

The meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Jan. 11 at the Andrews Chamber of
Commerce boardroom, 700 W. Broadway, Andrews.

Waste Control General Manager Tom Jones III said two storage areas are
allowed in the company's existing permit with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. Those storage facilities have never been built.

He said they would be 160 feet wide by 400 feet long. The material
stored would not be liquid, so they can be built out of asphalt instead
of concrete.

Jones said items that could be stored in the storage areas include soil,
concrete and personal protective equipment. Waste Control gets a lot of
its waste from national laboratories.

He said space has "gotten real tight" and customers are starting to ship
Waste Control more material by rail so it's getting greater quantity.

Although the storage units are permitted, Jones said the company must be
available for the public meeting.

Waste Control has submitted a license application which is now
undergoing review to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Waste Control filed its 4,000-page license application with a fee of
$500,000 in August.

If Waste Control's application is approved, it would be able to start
taking waste in 2008. The way the disposal site legislation is written,
it would include one facility for the interstate Waste Compact,
including Texas and Vermont. There would be a second facility for
government waste, including contaminated soil.

Both sites would get demolition debris, lab coats, respirators,
coveralls and gloves. Waste Control plans to dig an initial
concrete-lined hole that is 1,500 feet square and 75 feet deep. Right
below the surface is 800 feet of clay.

There are also monitor wells around the site and sump pumps that pump
the water into a holding well when it rains.

Nebraska has submitted a proposal to Texas to take its nuclear waste,
which would help Nebraska get out from under a $150 million judgment.
Nebraska was to host a nuclear waste site for members of its compact,
which also includes Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.

Waste Control Specialists has also applied to the Department of State
Health Services to amend its license so it can store uranium tailings
from a former U.S. Department of Energy uranium processing plant in
Fernald, Ohio.

The Department of Energy wants to move the waste by the end of 2006,
Gary Stegner, public affairs officer for the Department of Energy, has
said.

Jeff Wagner, public affairs officer for Fluor Fernald, the company
charged with cleaning up the Fernald site, said a request for proposals
will be mailed out the first part of November and a contract should be
awarded by Jan. 20, 2005.

Shipping would start sometime in early 2005 Ñ around February or March,
Wagner said.

Highlights Wednesday from the Texas Legislature
http://www.team4news.com/Global/story.asp?S=2802470
RADIOACTIVE TOPIC

Fifteen state senators want the health department to delay a decision in
a Dallas-based company's bid to accept millions of pounds of radioactive
material from U.S. weapons programs.

An attorney for Waste Control Specialists LLC says there is no basis for
a delay.

The company wants to store and dispose radioactive material, mostly
uranium mill tailings at a site in Andrews County, where it already
treats, monitors and stores low-level radioactive material. Waste
Control Specialists wants its state license amended to expand the amount
of material that can be stored.

The senators said Texas is the only state considering the waste and
noted Texas stands to receive no benefit from accepting it.

"If Texas is going to be the radioactive waste disposal site of last
resort for the Department of Energy, then it should receive a
substantial financial benefit for its willingness to serve the nation
and/or the nuclear energy industry in this way," the senator's letter
said.

Waste Control Specialists said further delay a decision will cause
irreparable harm to the company.

The health department is preparing responses to the letters, spokesman
Doug McBride said.

Johanns, lawmakers at odds over nuke waste payment

LINCOLN (AP) - Pay it now, the governor says.

Pay it later, many senators respond.

While the $145.8 million low-level nuclear waste lawsuit settlement has
to be paid, the governor and lawmakers appear to be melting down over
when to fork over the money.

Settlement of the case ended a lawsuit in which a federal judge ruled
that former Gov. Ben Nelson, now a U.S. senator, engaged in a
politically motivated and orchestrated plot to keep the dump from being
built in Nebraska.

Gov. Mike Johanns proposes in his budget released Thursday to pay the
settlement this August because the money is available, and he does not
want it to be spent on other ongoing programs. The total amount to be
paid would be higher if the payments are spread out, but interest earned
from keeping the money would make it a wash, Johanns said.

But Sen. Don Pederson of North Platte, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, said the best approach is to spread the payments out over
four years, as is allowed under the settlement.


Pederson supports putting the money in a fund earmarked specifically for
the settlement, but in case of an emergency the Legislature could vote
to take it out.

Pederson is not alone.

In an Associated Press survey prior to the start of the session, 22
senators said they would prefer to make four payments, while 11 said
they wanted to make one. Fourteen others did not answer, and two did not
complete the survey.

If paying it all now means delaying other needs, such as adequately
funding the university, then Lincoln Sen. Chris Beutler said he would
not support it.

Fellow Appropriations Committee members Sens. Pat Engel of South Sioux
City and Nancy Thompson of Papillion both said it was too early to know
what would be the best approach.

Lt. Gov. Dave Heineman, who put the budget together with Johanns and
will be his successor once the governor is confirmed as U.S. agriculture
secretary, said now is the time to pay the judgment.

"We need to bring finality to this issue," Heineman said. "Let's end
this chapter in Nebraska history this year."

Attorney General Jon Bruning, whose office negotiated the settlement,
said paying it off all at once was a wise decision.

Before the settlement, Nebraska offered to pay Texas a flat fee of $25
million to take the compact's low-level radioactive waste, plus $5
million to cover any unforeseen expenses for storing the waste.

The amount Nebraska pays in the settlement could be reduced to $130
million if the compact and Nebraska successfully negotiate access for
their waste at the proposed site in Texas.

Waste Control decision coming soon

BY Ruth Campbell

ANDREWS By next week, Waste Control Specialists should find out if it
will get some Ñ or all Ñ of the waste from the former U.S. Department of
Energy uranium processing plant in Fernald, Ohio.

The Department of State Health Services is conducting an engineering
review on the license amendment, so a decision could come as early as
Jan. 24, Richard Ratliff, radiation program officer for the Division of
Regulatory Services at the Department of State Health Services in
Austin, said.

If approved, the amendment would allow Waste Control to increase the
amount of waste it can store from 250,000 cubic feet to 1.5 million
cubic feet, Ratliff said.

Waste Control General Manager Tom W. Jones III said the amendment from
the State Department of Health Services could allow his company to
dispose of byproduct material ranging from uranium mine tailings from
East Texas to waste from the Fernald, Ohio, site.

"There are a number of sources with byproduct material that could be
disposed of with this authorization," Jones said.

Waste Control sits on a little more than 14,000 acres, Jones said. The
company uses 1,340 of those acres, he said.

Gary Stegner, public affairs officer for the U.S. Department of Energy
Ohio field office, said the agency would announce the company selected
to get Fernald waste on Jan. 20.

The waste would come from Fernald's three silos. Silos 1 and 2 contain
about 8,000 cubic yards of silty clay-like material from processing ore
from the Belgian Congo in the early 1950s.

Silo 3 contains 5,100 cubic yards of powder-like residues from the
processing of Canadian and U.S. ores from the '50s. The material has
been burned to reduce its volume, according to information from Fernald.

Margot Clarke, outreach coordinator for the Lone Star Chapter of the
Sierra Club in Austin, said Belgian Congo Pitch Blend is 65 percent
uranium. The material was processed at Fernald and at a facility in St.
Louis. The residues were stored because the African Metals Corp., which
owned the material, wanted to save it for additional processing that
never occurred, Fernald's information said.

Shipments from Silo 3 would start sometime in March, Stegner said.

Silo 3 waste would come in 20-foot long shipping containers with plastic
liners. During a two-year period, that would include 273 containers,
Ratliff said.

Material from Silos 1 and 2 would be transported in containers 6 feet in
diameter by 6 feet in height. Silo 1 and 2 would come out to 7,000
containers during a two-year period, he said.

The material cannot stay in one place for more than two years, unless
Waste Control gets a low-level radioactive waste disposal license from
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

After two years, the waste would have to be taken to a private
commercial disposal facility or the Nevada Test Site, Ratliff said.



Community support

Andrews has supported the idea of Waste Control from the beginning,
which is something Jones said the company really appreciates.

A recent public meeting on Waste Control's license amendment application
to take uranium tailings attracted 75 people, the majority of which
backed the idea.

"It shows we do have strong support, and it's important to the people in
this area," Jones said.

The company currently employs 110 people, and it's looking to grow.
"It's strictly going to depend on what business we get. We see steady
growth over the next five years. We'll add people as we can justify
them," Jones said.

"I think the thing is these are all good-paying jobs. Our starting
salary is very competitive with anything in this region. Our upper
salaries are probably better than other jobs in this area," he said.







Energy companies step up with major donations for Bush inauguration

(12-17) 22:55 PST WASHINGTON (AP) --

More than $4.5 million from the corporate world has flowed to President
Bush's inauguration fund, much of it from the energy industry and some
of its executives in contributions of $250,000 each.

Outside the energy sector, New Orleans Saints football team owner Tom
Benson gave $50,000 and his companies gave $200,000, the fund reported
Friday.

Northrop Grumman Corp., the world's largest shipbuilder and
second-largest U.S. defense contractor, donated $100,000.

Michael Dell, chairman of Dell Inc., the world's largest personal
computer maker, gave $250,000. So did United Technologies, maker
products ranging from escalators to aircraft engines.

Investment banking firm Stephens Group Inc. of Little Rock, Ark., gave
$250,000. And the education loan firm Sallie Mae gave $250,000.

Occidental Petroleum Corp., whose business stands to benefit from the
president's actions concerning Libya, donated $250,000, as did Exxon
Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Exxon Mobil
reported record third-quarter profits, thanks to higher prices for oil
and natural gas.

In April, Bush took steps to restore normal trade and investment ties
with Libya, enabling four American oil companies, including Occidental,
to resume commercial activities there after an 18-year absence.

Bush's action was a reward to Moammar Gadhafi for eliminating his most
destructive weapons programs.

Other donors from the energy sector included Texas oilman T. Boone
Pickens, who gave $250,000; and former Enron President Richard Kinder,
who left the firm five years before it collapsed and now is CEO of one
of the largest energy transportation and storage companies in the
country. Kinder also gave $250,000.

Energy provider Southern Co., which owns utility companies in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and Mississippi, gave $250,000.

The Nuclear Energy Institute, the policy organization of the nuclear
industry, gave $100,000. On the Web:

Inaugural donors: It's an investment

10:08 PM CST on Monday, January 17, 2005

By WAYNE SLATER / The Dallas Morning News

AUSTIN Ð Electrical contractor Ty Runyan says he likes President Bush's
efforts to curb union organizing, so he's showing his appreciation this
week with $100,000 for the inauguration.

"Bush has been very pro-business," said Mr. Runyan, whose non-union
Austin company is one of scores of big-dollar donors with interests in
Washington who are helping to underwrite the inaugural festivities

More than 150 corporations, trade associations, lobby groups and wealthy
individuals have contributed six-figure sums for a button-down
bacchanalia expected to cost up to $40 million. Most have benefited from
Bush administration policies.

Critics say the donors want special treatment at the expense of regular
citizens who don't have the money to schmooze with administration
figures and congressional leaders. Inauguration 2005


From AP: Bush Inauguration 2005

"What they've set up here is a corporate and special-interest-subsidized
inauguration," said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for
Responsible Politics, a nonprofit group that monitors political
spending.

"They're doing this as an investment."

Donors say they're expressing good citizenship. Mr. Bush dismissed
criticism of the corporate largess, telling reporters last week that he
sees no problem having private contributors pay for the week's parade,
candlelight dinners and gala balls. "There's no taxpayer money involved
in this," he said.

The swearing-in itself and security arrangements will be paid by the
federal government.

Mr. Noble said the unprecedented outpouring of corporate cash is the
product of ever-evolving campaign finance laws.

Federal statutes limit individual contributions to political candidates
at $2,000. And the McCain-Feingold law passed three years ago bars
corporations from donating unlimited amounts, so-called soft money, to
political parties.

That leaves political conventions and presidential inaugurations, both
exempt from limits, as ways for big-money donors to express support.

"They just view this as part of their government-relations program,
their lobby program," Mr. Noble said. Host of interests

The top-tier donors Ð $250,000 Ð have a host of interests pending in
Washington: oil and gas companies pressing to open more public lands for
exploration; power companies seeking lower pollution standards; Wall
Street investment firms that stand to gain from private Social Security
accounts; pharmaceutical companies that favored the prescription drug
benefit in Medicare; defense contractors; beer and tobacco companies;
and manufacturers that have benefited from tax cuts.

In exchange, donors get tickets to the most-prized inaugural events with
an opportunity to rub shoulders with the president, vice president and
key decision-makers in Congress.

Moreover, the week is festooned with a host of unofficial inaugural
events sponsored by corporations and K-Street lobbyists that will play
out in hotel ballrooms, law offices and corporate suites across
Washington.

Tonight, for example, Gov. Rick Perry will be feted by beer, liquor,
trucking and tobacco interests at a gala in the National Building Museum
featuring rockers Ted Nugent and ZZ Top.

Bill Webb, president and chief executive of the Texas Motor
Transportation Association, which is a lead organizer, said he hopes the
party will raise the group's political profile in Washington. Cabinet
members, governors and members of Congress from outside Texas have
called for tickets, he said.

"A governor calls and you're not going to turn him down," Mr. Webb said.
'Fantastic investment'

Mr. Runyan said he's a small-businessman, not a longtime political
mega-donor, whose fight with organized labor prompted him to start
giving money. "Prior to two years ago, I had no interest in politics,"
he said.

He praised Bush appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, which
has delivered some stinging defeats for labor. And he is backing a
GOP-sponsored bill that would make it harder to organize non-union
sites.

Mr. Runyan said he ran up a fortune in legal fees defending himself
against organizing efforts by members of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers. He said the union damaged his equipment and
sought to put him out of business.

"Having spent a half-million dollars in one year on legal fees, you
think spending $100,000 to support my president who represents American
business is a bad investment?" he said. "No. I think it's a fantastic
investment."

Ed Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO said Mr. Runyan is an anti-union employer
whose six-figure contribution to the Bush inaugural "tells me that
business must be pretty good." Longtime supporters

While some of this year's donors are newcomers like Mr. Runyan, many are
longtime financial Bush supporters:

--- Texas oilman Boone Pickens, whose most recent venture includes
speculating on water rights, has been a consistent contributor to the
Republican Party and gave $2.5 million to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,
which attacked Democrat John Kerry during last year's presidential
election, and $2.5 million for another independent group to air a
pro-Bush television commercial in Ohio.

Spokesman Jay Rosser said Mr. Pickens gave $250,000 to help pay for the
inauguration because he believes in the president, not because he is
seeking any special favors.

"Boone is 76, and there's not a lot left that he needs," Mr. Rosser
said. "He hates sitting on committees or through long committee
hearings. He has no interest in an ambassadorship or government service
of any kind."

--- Dallas financier Harold Simmons gave $100,000 to the inauguration. Mr.
Simmons has benefited from administration tax cuts and is seeking to
bury millions of cubic feet of radioactive waste from federal nuclear
weapons facilities at a site in West Texas.

Like Mr. Pickens, Mr. Simmons helped boost Mr. Bush's re-election with
$4 million to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

--- Houston-based Waste Management Inc. has given $100,000 to the
inauguration. The company, which operates landfills, is regulated by the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Among the $250,000 inaugural contributors is Southern Co., an
Atlanta-based power company whose executive vice president was a Bush
Ranger, an elite tier of donors who each raised $200,000 for the
president's re-election. The Bush administration sided with Southern and
other coal-fired utilities in 2003 by changing federal pollution rules.

Other donors include Las Vegas gambling executive Sheldon Adelson and
his wife, Miriam Adelson, who each contributed $250,000. Gambling and
hotel interests that are helping finance the inauguration have a stake
in having a ready supply of low-wage immigrant labor.

Staff writer Todd J. Gillman in Washington contributed to this report.

Uranium miner and energy firm Cameco sees potential in Chinese market
Updated at 16:55 on January 28, 2005, EST.

SASKATOON (CP) - Cameco Corp., the world's largest uranium producer,
sees great potential in China as the country moves to increase its
nuclear power capacity sharply.

"China itself is a small producer of uranium (and), as we see it, their
uranium endowment is pretty limited," Jerry Grandey, Cameco's CEO, said
during a conference call with analysts Friday. "They are going to be a
significant importer of uranium in the future and, hopefully over time,
they will become a valued customer."

Cameco is the world's largest uranium miner, with mines and mills in
Canada and the United States and more than 3,700 employees at the end of
2003. The company's uranium fuel is used to generate electricity in
nuclear energy plants around the world.

Grandey, who was part of a recent trade mission to China, said Chinese
demand for electricity grew about nine per cent in 2004. He said the
Chinese government has announced plans to have 20,000 megawatts of
nuclear power between by around 2015.

"That's an ambitious program, but it's not really more than what France
was able to achieve in the 1960-to-1970 period of time . . . So I don't
think there's much doubt that if China puts its mind to it, they can do
that," Grandey said.

The influence of China has loomed over the entire resource sector, as
the country has scoured the world for materials to fuel its economic
growth.

Husky Energy said earlier this month that it has held several
discussions with Chinese officials to "help further their knowledge" of
Canada's oilsands, but so far they have not discussed any potential
investments in Husky.

And Chinese State-owned mining company China Minmetals Corp. held talks
regarding the possible acquisition to acquire Noranda Inc. (TSX:NRD),
Canada's largest metals company.

Cameco shares traded lower Friday, a day after it its net profit in the
fourth quarter rose to $37 million, from $34 million in the same period
a year earlier, but fell short of market expectations.

Earth orbit turning into cosmic scrapheap
Manmade debris crowds the not-so-friendly skies
The most concentrated area of debris is in the region of space less than 1,240 miles 
(2,000 km) from Earth, known as low Earth orbit.
By Leonard David
Updated: 2:03 p.m. ET Feb. 2, 2005

As dump-sites go, there's nothing quite like Earth orbit: Totally gone
or near-dead spacecraft, spent motor casings and rocket stages, all the
way down to pieces of solid propellant, insulation, and paint flakes.
Toss in for good measure thousands of frozen bits of still-radioactive
nuclear reactor coolant dribbling from a number of aged Russian radar
satellites.

Here's the heavenly clutter count as of December 29, 2004.

There were 9,233 objects large enough to be tracked and catalogued by
the USSTRATCOM Space Surveillance Network. Of this total there were
2,927 payloads, along with 6,306 object classed as rocket bodies and
debris.

That's the stats as listed in the January issue of The Orbital Debris
Quarterly News, issued by the NASA Johnson Space Center Orbital Debris
Program Office in Houston, Texas.

Hardware survivors A major contributor to orbital debris is an object
suddenly breaking up. This can be caused when propellant and oxidizer
inadvertently mix; leftover fuel becomes overpressurized due to heating;
or when onboard batteries blow their tops. Some spacecraft have been
purposely detonated. Explosions can also be indirectly triggered by
collisions with fast-moving debris.

An example of fragmentation took place last October. A Russian Proton
Block DM auxiliary motor busted up, adding more than 60 pieces of junk
to the overall orbital debris scene.

At times some of this high-tech scrap survives its fiery plunge through
Earth's atmosphere. A growing list of these hardware survivors is
maintained by The Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at The
Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California.

Last year, for instance, a titanium rocket-motor casing weighing roughly
155 pounds (70 kilograms) was found near San Roque in Argentina. It was
identified as debris from a third stage of an American Delta 2 booster
that had been orbiting since October 1993.

Similarly, in July a metal pressure sphere and metal fragment fell into
Brazil, the likely debris from a second stage of a Delta 2 booster that
hurled the Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, toward the red planet a
year earlier.

Solar max and minimum
So what's the overall report card on orbiting trash look like over the years?

Fragmentation debris appears to have decreased noticeably in recent
years, but unfortunately the true picture is slightly different, said
Nicholas Johnson, Program Manager and Chief Scientist of the NASA
Orbital Debris Program Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas.

"A significant number of fragmentation debris objects have been created
during the period and are being tracked by the Space Surveillance
Network, but they have not yet been officially cataloged," Johnson told
SPACE.com. "This is a bureaucratic issue rather than an environmental
one. Meanwhile, spacecraft and rocket bodies continue to accumulate,
although for the latter the rate of increase is now small."

There's another "message" that can be seen in charting out the space
junk saga, found in the relative numbers of spacecraft, rocket bodies,
and other debris.

Johnson said that that we are nearing solar minimum when reentries --
particularly for small debris -- normally taper off. There was a clear
decrease in the population around 1990 during a period of high solar
activity. "Unfortunately, the last solar max did not produce a similar
result," he said.

Fall of Hubble So far this month there have been a couple of U.S. Delta
rocket stages that have reentered, as well as a Russian Proton motor.

All this is small stuff compared to something big coming in on its own
-- like the Hubble Space Telescope. There's good reason why an eventual
"controlled" reentry is being planned for that orbiting eye on the
universe.

Orbital debris analysts have figured out the risk to humans down below
if Hubble should plow through the Earth's atmosphere in an uncontrolled
manner.

At least two tons (2,055 kilograms) of the estimated 26,000 pounds
(11,792 kilograms) of the observatory would survive the plummet from
space. Such a fall would produce a debris track that stretches over 755
miles (1,220 kilometers) in length. The analysis suggests that the risk
posed to the human population in the year 2020 is 1:250 -- a risk that
exceeds NASA's own safety standard.

LES and AREVA Sign Memorandum of Understanding for Deconversion 
Facility near the National Enrichment Facility  

    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Feb. 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Louisiana Energy Services (LES)
and the nuclear energy services company AREVA, Inc., a subsidiary of the AREVA
Group, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that could lead to the
construction of a private uranium hexafluoride deconversion plant to support
the proposed National Enrichment Facility (NEF) outside Eunice, New Mexico.
    Since coming to New Mexico LES has stated, and committed to New Mexico
Governor Bill Richardson, Attorney General Patricia Madrid, and the citizens,
their intent to pursue construction of a private deconversion facility outside
of New Mexico to deconvert the NEF byproduct to uranium oxide that can be
disposed of safely. The oxide would then be sent to low-level radioactive
waste facilities outside the State of New Mexico for storage and/or disposal.
    "LES has committed that we will not store waste for more than a few years,
and we will dispose of byproducts out of state," said LES President Jim
Ferland.  "AREVA is the world expert in deconversion and they have been doing
it for over 20 years, with over 300,000 tons of uranium hexafluoride having
been processed.  We are delighted that their technology will be available to
us to achieve this goal."
    "We look forward to working with LES and bringing AREVA's global technical
expertise in uranium materials management to the project," said Mike McMurphy,
President of AREVA, Inc.
    While today's agreement marks significant progress toward a long-term
deconversion and disposal path, Ferland noted it is important to understand
this is just one step in a lengthy process.
    "Although in most cases we would not be making deconversion plans so early
in the process of developing an enrichment facility, Governor Richardson and
Attorney General Madrid have pressed for this kind of commitment by LES toward
out-of-state deconversion and disposal.  A deconversion facility to support
our enrichment plant is not necessary for a number of years yet, as there will
not be any material to deconvert for some time.  However, now that an
agreement has been reached, important site selection, licensing and other
activities must take place to identify a location that is suitable, convenient
to the labor force, acceptable to regulators, and near the NEF," Ferland said.
"Our agreement with AREVA provides a timeline for expected activities and
operations."
    LES has made a strong commitment to the citizens and officials of New
Mexico that there will be no long-term or indefinite storage of our byproduct
in New Mexico.  "As there are no ultimate disposal options in New Mexico,"
Ferland said.  "We believe it makes the most sense to look outside New Mexico
to site the deconversion facility.  Thus we are looking at site options in
Texas, near the NEF, where disposal of the deconverted uranium oxide could be
handled by a Texas low-level waste repository, should one be licensed by the
State of Texas.  This would bring economic development benefits there as well.
It is also possible however, for the uranium oxide to be disposed of in
several other licensed facilities in the United States.
    Ferland added, "This agreement on deconversion goes beyond the
requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and affirms our
company's commitment that we will remove and dispose of wastes and not store
them indefinitely in New Mexico."
    The NRC recently reaffirmed the plausibility of the LES backup option to
transfer the depleted uranium hexafluoride to the Department of Energy (DOE)
for disposition if for some reason a private deconversion facility is
unavailable.
    AREVA currently uses two proven technologies that will reduce the uranium
by-product to a stable oxide form -- which is recommended by the NRC for
easiest long-term disposal.
    AREVA's subsidiary, COGEMA, is currently operating a large-scale
deconversion plant in Pierrelatte, France.  Another AREVA subsidiary,
Framatome-ANP, operates a deconversion facility that supports a fuel
fabrication plant in Washington State which will be the model process used for
future DOE deconversion plants in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Kentucky.
    Within the U.S., AREVA has 41 offices and over 7000 employees. AREVA is
also already part of the New Mexico business community.  AREVA is a major
supplier to U.S. utilities for uranium, conversion and enrichment services,
fuel fabrication, reactor engineering, components and services, and spent fuel
management solutions.  Among other holdings, AREVA owns Canberra Aquila, Inc.,
an Albuquerque based company that is the recognized industry leader in the
manufacture of surveillance systems; review stations; and electronic seals and
tags for the worldwide nuclear safeguards community.
    The NEF will provide more than 200 permanent jobs and more than 400 multi-
year construction jobs in southeast New Mexico.  It will use a proven
technology that has operated safely in Europe for 30 years.
    When the license application is approved, the NEF will introduce the
world's most advanced uranium enrichment technology into the U.S. and provide
an alternative, domestic enrichment supply source to U.S. nuclear energy
companies.
    LES is a partnership of major nuclear energy companies. Partners include
Urenco, Westinghouse and U.S. energy companies Duke Power, Entergy and Exelon.
    With manufacturing facilities in over 40 countries and a sales network in
over 100, AREVA offers its clients technological solutions for nuclear energy
and electrical transmission and distribution.  The group also provides
interconnect systems to the telecommunications, computer and automotive
markets.  These businesses engage AREVA's 70,000 employees in the 21st
century's greatest challenges:  making energy and communication resources
available to all, protecting the planet and acting responsibly towards future
generations.  AREVA, Inc. is headquartered in Bethesda, Md., with AREVA
corporate headquarters in Paris, France.

Shares in the company (TSX:CCO) were down $1.87 or $41.16 in trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Cameco's earnings per share were up in the period ended Dec. 31, to 21
cents from 20 cents a year earlier. But the company missed the consensus
analyst forecast of 29 cents a share.

Revenues were $361 million, up from $272 million in 2003.

Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Jalonen, who had a sell rating on the
company's stock, said the disappointing results were due to
higher-than-expected costs at Bruce Power - an Ontario nuclear site in
which Cameco has a more than 30 per cent stake - and a one-time charge
related to a redemption of preferred shares.

Looking ahead, Cameco expects first-quarter consolidated revenues will
rise about 60 per cent, reflecting increased deliveries and prices in
the uranium and gold businesses and full consolidation of the Kumtor
gold mine in central Asia.

However, earnings from Bruce Power will be about half of those in the
2004 quarter.

Last year, Cameco had signed a deal to buy a stake in a Texas nuclear
power plant, but the deal fell through after the other owners of the
South Texas Project exercised their right of first refusal.

Grandey said Cameco will continue to look for other similar investments.

"We are actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities," he said.

Waste Control hearing set for today
Company wants to amend license and accept uranium enrichment waste
Odessa American
The Texas Senate Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a hearing at
1 p.m. today in Austin on Waste Control Specialists' application to
amend its license to take radioactive waste from the former U.S.
Department of Energy uranium enrichment plant in Fernald, Ohio.

Mike Sizemore, press secretary for Natural Resources Committee chairman
Sen. Ken Armbrister, said the hearing is being conducted to see if Waste
Control's request jibes with legislation enabling the company to take
hazardous waste.

The type of waste that would come from Fernald is not part of the
original agreement reached in the Legislature during the last session,
Sizemore said.

Waste Control currently stores low-level radioactive waste but wants a
permit to dispose of it as well.

It also wants to amend its permit to take in the Fernald waste.

Testifying at the hearing will be George Dials, president and chief
operating officer of Waste Control Specialists and attorney Michael
Woodward. Andrews Mayor Robert Zap and Russell Shannon, vice president
of the Andrews Industrial Foundation are also on the panel.

Also on the agenda as witnesses are: Robert F. Wather, manager of the
U.S. Department of Energy Field Office; Dennis Carr, director of the
Silos Project; Susan Jablonski, from the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality; Richard Ratliff, Texas Department of State Health
Services; and Hayden Childs of the Legislative Budget Board.

Radioactive waste proposal discussed

NATALIE GOTT

Associated Press

AUSTIN - Texas should receive some compensation if a Dallas-based
company is successful in its bid to accept millions of pounds of
radioactive waste from U.S. weapons programs, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst
said Tuesday.

"I'm looking for a revenue source for the state and probably the
county," the Republican said.

Waste Control Specialists LLC wants to store and dispose of material,
mostly uranium mill tailings, at a site in Andrews County where it
already treats, monitors and stores low-level radioactive material.

The company has asked the state health agency for a license to dispose
of the uranium tailings. It also is seeking to have its state license
amended to expand the amount of radioactive material that it can store.

Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, said Texas now stands to receive no
benefit from accepting the waste. He has been pushing for the health
department to delay a decision on Waste Control Specialists' requests
until the Legislature can discuss the issue.

The Senate Natural Resources Committee took up the issue Tuesday.

"If it comes here and we haven't weighed in, we've lost all our ability
to weigh in," Duncan said during the hearing.

Duncan said he wants the opportunity to make sure the proper regulatory
agency is handling the issue and to make sure that Texas gets the proper
financial benefit if it is going to take the waste.

Dewhurst said he would leave it to the Senate to determine how much the
state should benefit but said he thought the minimum should 5 percent of
the gross revenue, which is what the state would get under a bill it
approved last year to allow Texas to accept low level radioactive waste.
Under that bill, the county also gets 5 percent.

George Dials, Waste Control Specialists president and chief operating
officer, said he believed the fee for the low-level radioactive waste
site was fair but he hadn't included that figure in the bid to handle
the uranium tailings.

"I'd have to consider it and look at how it would affect our pricing,"
Dials said after the meeting.

"We bid on that job. We don't know if we won it yet," Dials said. "It
would be a little early for me to say we would willingly accept it."

Dewhurst said he has also asked lawmakers to ensure that there are
adequate financial safeguards and bonds in place to protect the
integrity of the site "so the state is not left holding the bag on a
super fund at some point."

Duncan said the amount of waste that Waste Control Specialists wants to
bring to Texas is enough to fill 800 railcars.

French firm to clean waste of proposed N.M. uranium plant

Feb. 4, 2005 08:20 AM

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - A consortium hoping to build a uranium enrichment
factory in southern New Mexico announced Thursday it has reached an
agreement with a French company to build a facility to handle the waste.

Areva Inc., a nuclear energy company based in France, and Louisiana
Energy Services said they have a memorandum of understanding on
construction of a private uranium deconversion plant that would support
LES's proposed National Uranium Enrichment Facility near Eunice.

Deconversion would change radioactive waste to a material that could be
shipped to a low-level nuclear waste dump outside New Mexico, possibly
in Texas. 


Getting rid of the 217,000 tons of depleted uranium the plant could
produce over its lifetime has been a major concern of Gov. Bill
Richardson and environmental groups, among others.

In a prepared statement, Richardson said the agreement announced
Thursday represents LES's good faith but added that "it doesn't yet
provide the assurance that there will be no long-term storage of waste
in New Mexico."

The deconversion plant would be built after the LES facility, and the
exact site and design of the second plant may not be chosen for years.

LES, a consortium of predominantly European backers, wants to build the
$1.2 billion plant to refine uranium for nuclear reactors. It first
proposed the New Mexico site in August 2003 after encountering
significant resistance to proposed sites in Louisiana and Tennessee.

Since waste from the plant could not be disposed of anywhere in the
United States, officials have pressed for a promise that it will not be
left in the state when LES leaves town.

Areva has operated a similar plant in France since 1984. Clement said
the company has treated about 330,000 tons of waste since then without
any serious accidents.

LES applied for a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license in December,
2003 for its enrichment plant, which would provide fuel for nuclear
power plants through a gas centrifuge process that increases the
concentration of the fissionable uranium-235 isotope.

A round of hearings surrounding the LES plant's license will begin next
week in Hobbs. Water contamination issues and the need for the plant are
among the items to be discussed. The NRC would have to issue a separate
license for the deconversion facility.

Hazardous cargo raises safety concerns

By JEFF CLAASSEN

Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram

Almost half the people in Tarrant County live close enough to railroad
tracks to be at risk if a derailment spilled hazardous cargo, yet there
is no way for residents to know what trains carry through their
neighborhoods.

Soon, even less information could be available. Worried about terrorism,
federal officials are considering stripping the large toxic-chemical
warning labels from cargo trains, which would remove the only indicator
available to the general public.

At the same time, officials are considering plans to reroute trains
carrying hazardous cargo around metropolitan areas. The cost, however,
could run to billions of dollars.

"You can have 24 trains going through some crossings every day, one an
hour," said state Rep. Mike Krusee, R-Taylor, who has worked on possible
rail relocations in and near Austin. "You're mixing a high density of
freight rail capacity and people living right next to the tracks. You
get bad accidents, and humans don't win."

A January derailment in South Carolina that killed nine people and
prompted a mile-wide evacuation, as well as two that killed four people
last year in San Antonio, have revived a national discussion about rail
safety.

Spokesmen for the railroads point to the advantage of using trains:
Trucks are more expensive for hauling cargo long distances and are 16
times more likely to have an accident that spills chemicals or other
hazardous cargo.

Tarrant County has not had a fatal derailment in at least 30 years,
according to the Federal Railroad Administration. But activists and
officials worried about cargo trains say that rail cars are dangerous
because one can carry as much material as three or four trucks.

Trucks carrying deadly chemicals and other hazardous cargo must use
specific freeways when moving through metro areas. But no such limits
exist for train shipments, according to officials with
emergency-response departments and other agencies.

Chemicals accounted for about 10 percent of train cargo, or 160 million
tons, in 2003, according to the Association of American Railroads.
Trains carry a wide range of chemicals, including chlorine and ammonia,
which can be deadly when released into the air.

Federal laws require hazardous cargo to be carried in fortified
container cars, with the strictest requirements for radioactive waste,
emergency-response officials said. Engineers must also carry lists, or
manifests, of what is on each train.

Local worries

About 324 miles of tracks run through Tarrant County, and about 650,000
people -- or 45 percent of the population -- live within a mile of them.
Even a small spill could affect thousands: More than 26,000 people live
within 100 yards of tracks, according to a Star-Telegram analysis.

Several Tarrant residents living near tracks said the recent news
reports created at least momentary anxiety.

"I wonder what is on those trains," said Mark Jones, who has lived near
the Union Pacific railroad tracks off Oakland Boulevard in east Fort
Worth for about 10 years.

Others said they don't worry at all.

"I've lived in the same spot for 56 years," said Traci Hubbard, who
lives near Jones. "We've grown up with the trains, and so have our
kids."

In Colleyville, the Tarantula Train's vintage engine and rail cars roll
past Michael Leathers' house, sharing the tracks with cargo trains and
the right-of-way with joggers and bicyclists, who use a nearby concrete
path.

"We assume it's OK and that the railroad companies take the precautions
they have to," Leathers said. "I'm sure they're inspected on a regular
basis."

Until last year, cargo trains were also a largely overlooked part of the
landscape in San Antonio and surrounding Bexar County.

In June, a train carrying chlorine gas, which is crucial for water
purification, derailed south of the city. A conductor and two people in
a nearby neighborhood died from inhaling the fumes.

In November, a train careered out of control in an industrial area near
downtown, burst through the wall of a storage building and killed an
office worker.

The death toll from those accidents and others has prompted officials in
San Antonio and elsewhere to look for new ways to deal with cargo
trains.

"We have a $500,000 study with the Texas Department of Transportation
looking at moving train traffic, looping it around the city," said
Nelson Wolff, the Bexar County judge. "It will take a combination of
state, federal and local money to do it. The government really needs to
step up and be part of the solution."

Rerouting trains

In the fall, Wolff and other politicians from the San Antonio area
lobbied officials in Washington, D.C., for tougher safety enforcement
and federal funds for rail relocation.

That debate hit home in Washington just a few months later. The deadly
South Carolina derailment, which spilled chlorine gas, led to the
realization that cargo trains pass within four blocks of Congress.

Last week, the D.C. City Council banned hazardous shipments through the
city for three months. The council may vote on a permanent ban, which
requires congressional approval.

Rail lines through cities remain busy, but many rural lines have been
sold or abandoned because they didn't generate enough revenue to compete
with the trucking industry, said transportation and railroad officials.

Now Wolff and other officials hope some of those old lines can be put to
use -- or that new ones can be constructed.

"It has been 150 years since new rail lines were built," said Krusee,
the Taylor lawmaker. "Our cities have grown around the railroads. All
these railroad crossings have been added. It can take more than a day
for a cargo train to get through a major city, and a week to cross the
state."

Officials in North Texas are also studying ways to route long-distance
cargo trains around the metro area. Officials in Austin expect rail
relocation to be discussed during this legislative session.

The solution carries its own problem: a huge price tag. Advocates of
rail relocation, such as Robert Nichols, a member of the Texas
Transportation Commission, point to the Alameda Corridor in Los Angeles.
It cost $2.4 billion to replace grade crossings with overpasses,
consolidate some rail lines and run the tracks underground in some
areas.

"Where is the money going to come from?" said Tom White, a spokesman for
the Association of American Railroads.

It won't come from the railroads, which are facing stiff competition
from truckers, White said.

Uncertain future

Some Texas officials say rail relocation could be a key part of the
Trans-Texas Corridor, a network of new highways and other transportation
lines that would run from border to border and bypass cities, easing
truck traffic on interstates.

Gov. Rick Perry has lobbied hard for the extensive project, which would
be built by a Spanish contractor and other companies that would collect
tolls for 50 years to pay for it. The contractors, however, have no
substantial plans for new rail until 2020.

And at the rate North Texas is growing, by the time the tracks are
built, new neighborhoods might have already spread out to meet them,
said Juan Ortiz, emergency management coordinator for Tarrant County and
Fort Worth.

"We might find ourselves moving railroads fairly often," Ortiz said.
"Would we have to keep moving rail lines every 10 or 20 years?"

In the meantime, residents will have to take it on faith that the
railroads and the government are protecting them.

Before 9-11, government and railroad officials said disclosure would
force shippers to reveal sensitive information to business rivals.

Since the attacks, officials have said that releasing details about
hazardous shipments exposes trains and trucks to terrorists.

"It does not make any sense to make that kind of information public,"
said White, of the railroad association.

But sealing off information can hide a lack of action by the government,
said Rick Blum, whose organization, OpenTheGovernment.org, provides an
online search of pollution records.

Secrecy also prevents the public from taking part in the debate on how
to make cargo trains safer, he said.

"The public has to be part of this discussion," Blum said. "Instead,
we're seeing a very tall brick wall being put up between the government
and the public. We're afraid that wall is only hiding inaction and
embarrassment."

IN THE KNOW

Trains and Tarrant County

Tarrant has long been a busy rail hub. Some facts about the local
traffic:

---  Lots of track: Tarrant County has 324 miles of rail lines. The
county's freeways and highways, by comparison, span 422 miles.

---  Heavy traffic: Most Tarrant County rails are busy. The busiest, with
21 to 30 trains a day, are tracks that run from the Dallas County border
through central Arlington to downtown Fort Worth, and north and south
from downtown Fort Worth to the county border.

---  Accidents: Seventy-seven derailments from January 2003 to October 2004
injured four railroad workers and caused $5 million in damage. Most were
at low speeds in rail yards or other places. Twelve were at 20 mph or
faster.

---  Collisions: Thirty-five trains hit vehicles at crossings from January
2003 to October 2004, killing one motorist and injuring nine others.
Five of the crashes came when drivers went around the safety gates.

Entergy Nuclear CEO Says Congress Needs to Expand Nuclear Energy

http://www.entergy-nuclear.com

    SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The U.S. Congress
urgently needs to enact a national energy policy that includes an expanded
role for new nuclear energy plants, a top executive of the nation's second
largest operator of nuclear plants told a utility executive conference here
today.
    "If we value our environment, our quality of life and our children's
future, we must decide soon how we are going to meet our future energy
demands," Gary J. Taylor, president and CEO, Entergy Nuclear in Jackson,
Miss., told an international group of utility executives attending the 2005
Westinghouse Symposium.
    "Nuclear energy can generate abundant power dependably at low cost and
without emitting air pollutants. It deserves an increased role in a diverse
energy mix to provide a secure, affordable supply of energy in the future."
    He praised President Bush for calling for the construction of "safe, clean
nuclear energy" in his State of the Union Address Feb. 2.
    "With oil hitting $55 a barrel and natural gas having doubled in three
years, the need for America to encourage some alternatives couldn't be
clearer," President Bush said. "One of those alternatives should be advanced
nuclear power plants because we have decades of uranium fuel in this country."
    Taylor said the federal government should set appropriate incentives in a
national energy policy to encourage the building of new nuclear power plants.
"I believe the new U.S. Congress understands the urgency. I hope the Congress
can pass an energy policy this year."
    He said one federal incentive would be 80 percent loan guarantees, much
like FHA guarantees on homeowner loans, for the first few plants, effectively
reducing the interest rate on the debt to build a new plant. There would be no
cost to the federal government unless the project failed to produce revenue as
scheduled.
    The 2004 energy bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but
was stalled in the U.S. Senate last fall over provisions unrelated to nuclear
energy. Nuclear provisions of the bill had strong bipartisan support.
    Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR) is an integrated energy company engaged
primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations.
Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of
electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator
in the United States with about 9,000 megawatts of nuclear generating
capacity. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.6 million utility customers in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of
over $10 billion and approximately 14,000 employees.

Expert: Enrichment plant won't harm water
Louisiana Energy Services eyes uranium enrichment facility near Eunice, N.M.
By Ruth Campbell
Odessa American

HOBBS, N.M. An expert testifying at an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
hearing here Monday said there is no cause for concern about underground
or surface water safety if a proposed uranium enrichment facility is
built near Eunice, N.M.

Roger Peery, the CEO and senior hydrogeologist with John Shomaker and
Associates in Albuquerque, made the assertion as one of the witnesses in
the hearing at the Lea County Event Center in Hobbs. The hearing is part
of the licensing process Louisiana Energy Services must go through to
build the $1.2 billion National Enrichment Facility.

Representatives from the New Mexico Attorney General's Office, the
Nuclear Information and Resource Service and Public Citizen and the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission are represented.

Peery said the National Enrichment Facility would also sit on a layer of
impermeable red clay, the same type under Waste Control Specialists
low-level radioactive storage site in Andrews County, so it's unlikely
any runoff would make it into the water supply.

Concerns about water safety were set to take up testimony most of
Monday. The hearing, expected to last through the week, will also cover
implications of waste storage, how much water the plant would use and
the need for the facility, Dave McIntyre, Nuclear Regulatory Commission
spokesman, said.

Meanwhile, LES has signed a memorandum of understanding with AREVA Inc.
to construct a deconversion facility near the proposed uranium
enrichment plant.

The plant would convert NEF byproduct to uranium oxide that can be
disposed of safely, according to an LES news release. The oxide would be
sent to a low-level radioactive waste facility, possibly Waste Control
Specialists, LES spokeswoman April Wade said.

The state of New Mexico has long wanted LES to have a place to store its
byproduct outside the state.

Getting licensed for the deconversion facility could take five years,
Wade said.

The NRC is expected to make a decision on the National Enrichment
Facility by June 2006, officials have said.

Uranium deconversion facility won't be in New Mexico
	Email to a Friend		Printer Friendly Version 	 

HOBBS, N.M. A facility to treat waste from a proposed uranium enrichment
factory near Eunice will not be built in New Mexico. That's what the
chief engineer for Louisiana Energy Services, Rod Krich, told the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
yesterday in Hobbs.

L-E-S wants to build a one-point-two (b) billion-dollar factory to
refine uranium for nuclear reactors.

But questions have been raised about how the company plans to dispose of
its radioactive waste.

L-E-S has reached an agreement with Areva Incorporated to build a
facility to handle the waste.

The only other site currently being discussed for the waste-treatment
facility is in Texas.

A decade ago, L-E-S wanted to build a uranium enrichment plant in
Claiborne Parish. The plan was abandoned after opponents accused the
group of environmental racism for picking a site populated by
minorities.

Nuclear plant unit springs small leak
Officials say no one in danger in Bay City area
By JENALIA MORENO and DAVID IVANOVICH
Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle

One of the two units of the South Texas Project nuclear plant was shut
down Wednesday because of a small leak thought to have developed in a
pipe in its reactor coolant system. ADVERTISEMENT

Officials discovered the problem in Unit 2 of the plant, near Bay City,
during a routine inspection. They began the shutdown at 12:22 p.m. and
expected the process to be completed sometime today.

Officials used remote cameras to find the source of the water leak in
the unit, in operation since 1988.

The affected pipe carries super-heated water that is under intense
pressure to prevent it from boiling.

"It's water circulating through there, but when there's a leak it
flashes into steam," said Victor Dricks, a spokesman for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in Arlington.

Such steam "could be slightly radioactive," he said.

However, neither the plant's 1,300 employees nor the public were in any
danger, said Mark McBurnett, the plant's manager of nuclear safety
assurance.

He added that "no significantly different radiation levels" were
detected escaping from the containment building, which has special
filters.

The leak was deemed "very small," Dricks said, releasing about 0.13
gallon per minute.

Alan Mikus, a plant spokesman, said the unit could be back up within a
matter of days.

In April 2003, another leak shut down Unit 1 at the plant, about 80
miles southwest of Houston, for more than four months.

New Mexico weighs reactor-fuel plant
By Matthew L. Wald The New York Times
Friday, February 11, 2005

Nuclear project would be biggest in U.S.
 
HOBBS, New Mexico The uranium enrichment centrifuge plant that gets the
most attention these days is in Iran, but a larger one, carefully
watched by the civilian nuclear power industry and its opponents, is
taking shape here, in the desert just west of Texas. If built, it would
be the largest commercial nuclear project ordered in this country in
more than three decades.

To supporters, the proposed $1.3 billion plant is a sign of faith in the
U.S. nuclear power industry's perseverance and revival, and a way to
make reactor fuel with far less energy, replacing an enrichment
technology invented for the Manhattan Project.

To opponents, it is a risky new industry that could release clouds of
chemical poisons. Even if it operates accident-free, opponents say, it
would produce radioactive waste that nobody knows what to do with.

New Mexico's governor, Bill Richardson, said in an interview that he
would support the project if there were "an ironclad guarantee" that the
waste would leave the state.

But Richardson, who was energy secretary in the Clinton administration,
has expressed skepticism that the Energy Department would take the waste
away, as the law requires.

The waste would indeed leave the state, says the company that wants to
build here, Louisiana Energy Services, but only barely. The company's
preferred disposal site is just over the state line, in Texas.

The plant would duplicate centrifuge technology in use in Europe.

Uranium, mixed with fluorine and heated to a gas, is spun in a metal
tube at more than 1,000 revolutions per second. Uranium-235, the kind
that splits easily in a reactor, flows to the center, as uranium-238,
which is heavier, flows to the outside.

In natural uranium, the proportion of U-235 is about 0.7 percent; for
reactors it is raised to 3 percent to 5 percent. For weapons it is
commonly pushed above 90 percent.

The plant here, which would not begin to produce enriched uranium until
late 2008, would be open to inspectors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the builders said.



A critical issue in hearings here this week before the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission is what would happen to the depleted uranium.

Louisiana Energy says it has a preliminary agreement with a nuclear
services company to take the fluorine out of the mixture.

The remaining uranium oxide, which is chemically nonreactive, could be
buried in the Texas landfill. It could also be turned over to the Energy
Department, which already has about 700,000 tons of depleted uranium,
still mixed with fluorine and much of it in decaying metal canisters, in
Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.

Two antinuclear groups - the Nuclear Information and Resource Service,
and Public Citizen - hired a consultant, Arjun Makhijani, who asserted
at the hearings that the depleted uranium had emissions similar to
plutonium and that there was no proven means for safe disposal.

A Louisiana Energy Services spokesman, Marshall Cohen, said the depleted
uranium was "less radioactive than when it came out of the ground."
Opponents say that may be so, but it is no longer in the ground, and
thus poses a problem.

Hearings in the fall will examine whether the technology is safe and
whether the company will set aside enough money for cleanup.

Two commercial fuel processing plants have become federal liabilities.

Supporters say the plant would modernize nuclear fuel production and cut
its costs.

Cohen said that 70 percent of the plant's first 10 years of production
had been sold and that the plant would be viable whether or not any new
reactors were built.

The last time a reactor was ordered in the United States and not
canceled was 1973.

The plant would enrich enough uranium to make about 5 percent of the
electricity used in the country.

Although Richardson has said that the waste problem is central, local
sentiment seems favorable. The plant would run for 30 years and would
provide 210 permanent jobs with an annual payroll of $10 million,
including benefits, according to Louisiana Energy. That is a substantial
sum amid the region's fields of peanuts and cotton, interspersed with
oil and gas wells.

Harry Teague, who is chairman of the Lea County Commission and whose
business is oil-field services, said the oil and gas business was strong
but added, "Hobbs has always been a boom-and-bust town."

Existing local industry is dangerous, Teague said, citing the hydrogen
sulfide gas that rises with methane out of most natural gas wells here.
Nuclear fuel is not risk free, he said, but "it's not near as bad as
hydrogen sulfide."

America's nuclear stealth war
Paul Rogers
10 - 2 - 2005
The United States denounces Tehran's development of nuclear weapons while quietly modernising its own arsenal.
------------------------------------------
	http://www.opendemocracy.net/themes/article-2-2338.jsp
	

The visit of Condoleezza Rice to Europe in the past week was accompanied
by notably hardline rhetoric towards Iran. In describing Iran (at a
meeting with French intellectuals) as not merely an "authoritarian" but
a "totalitarian" state, the new United States secretary of state was
also underlining the George W Bush administration's absolute opposition
to Tehran's nuclear weapons programme. In this context, recent
revelations about the US's own nuclear weapons development plans are
particularly significant.

When President Bush was re-elected in November 2004, many arms-control
specialists feared that his administration would make rapid progress
towards a national missile defence system and modernisation of the US
nuclear arsenal. To their surprise, both developments appeared to
receive setbacks in the election aftermath.

First, and in light of the rising costs of the war in Iraq, there were
indications that a number of high-tech military projects would be scaled
back or even cancelled Ð including programmes connected with missile
defence, such as the airborne laser (see "Missiles and Militias", 23
December 2004).

Second, and more remarkable, was Congress's decision to cut all funding
for four nuclear-weapons programmes (see
www.basicint.org/update/WNU041124-PF.htm). These, in turn, were aimed at
making it easier to start nuclear tests; developing a new production
plant for nuclear warheads; creating advanced design concepts for new
kinds of nuclear weapons; and designing and developing a highly
specialised nuclear weapon for destroying deeply-buried underground
targets.

Bunker-buster bluster

The decision over the last of these programmes, known as the Robust
Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), was particularly surprising, given the
claims made by Bush administration officials about North Korea's and
Iran's plans to situate nuclear weapons in deep underground bunkers.
Several factors influenced Congress's decision, including the belief
that more "boots on the ground" rather than new nuclear weapons were
needed, as well as traditional horse-trading between people representing
different electoral districts.

More thoughtful was the concern of some representatives that the United
States could not simultaneously be seen to be investing heavily in new
nuclear weapons like the RNEP while condemning other countries for
merely initiating such a process. They pointed to the fact that the
United States still possesses more than enough nuclear weapons to
satisfy the most unlikely needs, and had already modified one of its
older nuclear warhead designs to produce a rather crude
earth-penetrating device.

Even though the US nuclear arsenal is a lot smaller than at the height
of the cold war, the most recent estimate is that its current deployment
still stands at approximately 5,300 operational nuclear warheads, with
nearly 5,000 more placed in what is termed a "responsive reserve force"
or else only partially dismantled (see Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, January/February 2005). Many of these weapons contain
enormous destructive force; the nearly 400 W88 warheads for the Trident
submarine missile fleet are each about thirty times as powerful as the
Hiroshima bomb.

The early earth-penetrating warhead was the B61-11, a variant of the
standard B61 tactical nuclear bomb, with heavily modified casing and
fusing. This was put together in the mid-1990s and can be deployed on
the B-2A stealth bomber. At the time it was produced, strenuous efforts
were made to say that it wasn't a new weapon but merely a modification
of an old one. This was true in the sense that the new weapon recycled
the core of the nuclear warhead or "physics package", but to claim there
is little difference is equivalent to taking the engine out of a
Chevrolet, using it to power a boat, and then claiming that the boat is
still a car.

A shadowy strategy

When George W Bush succeeded Bill Clinton in 2001, most people assumed
that the latter's cautious attitude to wholesale nuclear modernisation
would be discarded. The nuclear weapons laboratories certainly exerted
systematic pressure in arguing for new programmes. Such pressure makes
Congress's decision to cut funding even more unexpected Ð even, to many
in the arms-control community, too good to be true.

This week it became clear that it was just that, as the Bush
administration decided to present Congress with a new funding request
(see Walter Pincus, "Bush Request to Fund Nuclear Study Revives Debate",
Washington Post, 9 February 2005).

Moreover, it turns out that programmes are already underway to design
new nuclear warheads using completely different budget lines (see
William J Broad, "U.S. Redesigning Atomic Weapons", International Herald
Tribune, 8 February 2005). Around 100 specialists at the three US
nuclear weapons laboratories Ð Lawrence Livermore in California, Los
Alamos in New Mexico and Sandia in Texas Ð are involved in an initial $9
million project, one that is planned to develop into a full-scale
programme capable of producing designs for completely new weapons within
the next five-to-ten years.

An immediate question arises: given the attitude of Congress, how is it
possible that the anodyne-sounding, science-based Stockpile Stewardship
Program contains an element focused on producing new weapons? For the
advocates of the programme, the answer is straightforward Ð the United
States stopped producing entirely new nuclear weapons at least fifteen
years ago, many of the warheads in its current stockpile are far older
than that, and there is no guarantee that they will work if they have to
be used.

In such circumstances, these proponents say, a programme overseeing the
maintenance and reliability of the nuclear arsenal has an obligation to
produce new designs capable of replacing the ageing arsenal. They also
argue that producing new, robust and reliable weapons means that the
United States will be able to manage with fewer weapons.




Paul Rogers's column "Christian Zionists and neocons: a heavenly
marriage" (3 February 2005) received strong interest and attention from
readers. For more detailed study of the issue, see the work of Stephenen
Sizer here.



Arms-control experts, by contrast, claim that the US's nuclear stockpile
is sufficiently up-to-date in design terms, could be reduced much
further, and has no need of a new bout of modernisation. Daryl G
Kimball, executive director of prominent Washington-based group the Arms
Control Association, comments:

"The existing stockpile is safe and reliable by all standards, so to
design a new warhead that is even more robust is a redundant activity
that could be a pretext for designing a weapon that has a new military
mission."

This is the crux of the matter Ð that the Bush administration seems to
have found a way of circumventing Congress's decision to cut funding for
what were clearly intended to be major new nuclear weapons programmes.

It is now only three months until the next review conference for the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which meets in New York in May. Yet even
as it approaches, the United States is insisting that Iran cannot even
begin the process of developing a nuclear infrastructure, let alone
produce small numbers of weapons. For George W Bush, who says that a
nuclear-armed Iran would be "a very destabilising force in the world",
this is a sensible policy; many citizens in the United States and other
countries will question whether the same characterisation may equally be
applied to current American nuclear policy (and Iranians too may see
things very differently, not least given the size and reach of the
Israeli nuclear arsenal).

The Bush administration wants to build a coalition for countering
Iranian nuclear ambitions. This means it needs to avoid giving the
impression of furthering its own nuclear developments. The Congressional
decision in November helped serve that purpose. The more recent reports
on what is actually happening in terms of US nuclear developments do
not. They lend support to those analysts who believe that the United
States will take a singularly hardline stance at the NPT review
conference. This may be typical of the unilateralist tendencies of the
Bush administration, but will certainly not further the control of

American Ecology Posts $13.1 Million in 2004 Operating Income; Fourth Quarter Operating Income Increases to $3.4 Million

BOISE, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 8, 2005--Jim Baumgardner, Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Ecology
Corporation (NASDAQ:ECOL), today announced financial results for the
three and twelve months ending December 31, 2004. For the fourth quarter
of 2004, the Company reported net income of $3.2 million or $0.18 per
fully diluted share compared to net income of $3.1 million or $0.17 per
diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months
ending December 31, 2004, the Company reported net income of $23.4
million, or $1.32 per share compared to a net loss of $8.7 million or
($0.52) per fully diluted share in 2003. For 2004, the Company reported
operating income of $13.1 million or 35% higher than the $9.7 million in
operating income posted in 2003.

"American Ecology's core hazardous and radioactive waste treatment and
disposal business delivered another quarter of strong earnings,"
Baumgardner stated, adding, "The significant increase in operating
income year over year demonstrates that our growth strategy is working."

Fourth Quarter 2004

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 decreased to $13.5 million, down
$3.4 million from $16.9 million in 2003. This decrease in revenue
reflected a large New Jersey clean up project shipped to the Company's
Idaho facility in late 2003 which included a substantial transportation
component and was not fully replaced by increased disposal revenue from
other customers in 2004. Quarterly revenue was also adversely affected
by a July 1, 2004 fire at the Company's Robstown, Texas facility which
required the facility to suspend waste treatment operations. On December
1, 2004 the Texas facility resumed limited treatment operations. As
previously disclosed, Texas treatment revenue was approximately $1
million per quarter prior to the fire.

During the quarter, the Company recognized $431,000 of expected proceeds
from business interruption insurance which reflects the actual
incremental expenses incurred since July 1, 2004 directly resulting from
the fire. The Company's total business interruption claim is materially
larger. Management believes the full amount claimed is valid, and
anticipates recognizing additional income when its claim is fully
resolved with its insurance carrier. The Company also impaired the
assets destroyed by the fire and recognized the insured value of such
assets during the quarter, resulting in a $275,000 net gain.

"Future reported financial results will be affected until we resume full
treatment operations and the business interruption claim is resolved,"
Baumgardner noted.

As reported on December 10, 2004, the Company increased its estimate for
closure and post-closure costs at its closed Sheffield, Illinois
facility by $715,000 based on updated analyses. The combination of lower
revenue and the increased closure estimate reduced gross profit to $5.1
million compared to gross profit of $5.9 million in the fourth quarter
of 2003. While gross profit decreased, it did not decrease as much as
revenue, allowing gross margin to increase to 38% of revenue in the
fourth quarter of 2004 compared to 35% of revenue in the same quarter
last year. This increase in gross margin reflects a lower percentage of
quarterly revenue derived from low-margin transportation services.

Selling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A) for the fourth quarter
decreased to $2.1 million or 16% of revenue, compared to $2.7 million,
or 16% of revenue in the same quarter last year. The decrease in fourth
quarter SG&A primarily reflects a $461,000 reduction in the Company's
allowance for doubtful accounts.

"In 2004 the Company improved both the quality and turnover of its
accounts and substantially reduced receivable write-offs compared to
prior years." Baumgardner stated, adding, "This progress allowed us to
materially reduce our allowance for bad debt while maintaining an
adequate allowance for the future."

The Company's number of days sales outstanding, a measure of accounts
receivable turnover, decreased to an average of 60 days outstanding for
2004, down from 68 days in 2003. In 2004, the Company wrote off $67,000
of bad debt, down from $228,000 in 2003.

Despite lower revenue and the charge for the increased Illinois closed
site reserve, lower SG&A and recognition of a portion of the business
interruption claim allowed the Company to deliver operating income of
$3.4 million, an 8% increase over the $3.1 million posted for the same
quarter last year.

Twelve Months 2004

Revenue for the twelve months ending December 31, 2004 declined 5% to
$54.2 million compared to $57.0 million for 2003. The decrease in
revenue was attributable to less transportation revenue, significantly
decreased disposal volume at the Company's Texas facility following the
July 1 fire, a slight decrease in the Idaho facility's disposal volume
as certain projects were delayed into 2005, and a lower average selling
price for the Company's disposal services. However, the lower volumes in
Texas and Idaho were offset by an 80% increase in volume at the
Company's Beatty, Nevada facility. Overall waste volumes were up 2.5%
over the previous year.

2004 gross profit dipped only slightly to $23.3 million or 43% of
revenue, compared to gross profit of $23.6 million or 42% of revenue for
2003. While revenue decreased, gross profit remained at a similar level
due to a higher proportion of treatment and disposal revenue versus
lower margin transportation revenue in 2003. In 2004, treatment and
disposal revenue represented 81% of total revenue, up from 77% of total
revenue in 2003.

For the year, SG&A decreased to $10.6 million or $3.3 million lower than
2003. Lower 2004 SG&A costs reflect materially reduced legal spending, a
reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts, and generally lower
administrative costs due to improved business systems and efficiencies.
In 2003 SG&A was negatively impacted by $1.8 million in legal expense
for the Company's Ward Valley, California damages claim.

As noted above, for the year ending December 31, 2004, the Company
reported operating income of $13.1 million, or a 35% increase over the
$9.7 million operating income posted in 2003.

Large one-time events in both years contributed to the large swing in
2004 net income. In 2003, the Company wrote off a $21 million deferred
site development asset following an adverse trial court ruling in the
Ward Valley litigation and expensed an additional $1.8 million for
related legal fees. The Company also expensed $2.5 million for
discontinued operations at its former Oak Ridge, Tennessee facility, and
posted a $5 million gain on sale of its Texas sanitary landfill in 2003.
Following the June 2004 sale of the Oak Ridge facility, the Company
recognized approximately $1 million of income and adjusted its valuation
allowance on its deferred tax assets. This produced an $11.3 million tax
benefit in the second quarter of 2004. Lastly, the July 1, 2004 fire at
the Texas facility had a material adverse impact on net income for the
year.

"For the first time in over a decade, American Ecology entered the new
year fully focused on its core waste treatment and disposal business,"
stated President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Romano, adding,
"With full resumption of treatment services in Texas, continued
efficient operation of all four of our disposal facilities and a solid
sales outlook, management is targeting operating income growth of 15%
for 2005."

will be held Wednesday, February 9, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time.

Uranium Enrichment Plant Is Proposed for New Mexico
By MATTHEW L. WALD

Published: February 10, 2005

HOBBS, N.M., Feb. 9 - The uranium enrichment centrifuge plant that gets
the most attention these days is in Iran, but a larger one, carefully
watched by the civilian nuclear power industry and its opponents, is
taking shape here, in the desert just west of the Texas border. If
built, it would be the largest commercial nuclear project ordered in
this country in more than three decades.

To supporters, the proposed $1.3 billion plant is a sign of faith in the
nuclear power industry's perseverance and revival, and a way to make
reactor fuel with far less energy, replacing an enrichment technology
invented for the Manhattan Project.

To opponents, it is a risky new industry that could release clouds of
chemical poisons. Even if it operates accident-free, opponents say, it
would produce radioactive waste that nobody knows what to do with.

New Mexico's governor, Bill Richardson, said in an interview he would
support the project if there were "an ironclad guarantee" that the waste
would leave the state. But Mr. Richardson, who was energy secretary in
the Clinton administration, has expressed skepticism that the Energy
Department would take the waste away, as the law requires.

The waste would leave the state - barely, says the company that wants to
build here, Louisiana Energy Services. The company's preferred disposal
site is a landfill several hundred yards over the Texas border that has
applied for permission to take low-level nuclear waste.

The site itself, a mile square, was determined to be well suited by
Louisiana Energy's rival, which faces challenges in surviving the
technology developed by Louisiana Energy.

The rival, USEC, which used to stand for the United States Enrichment
Corporation, uses gaseous diffusion technology, invented for the
Manhattan Project. The company, which was part of the Energy Department
until it began operation as a private corporation in 1998, tried to
build an enrichment system here that used lasers, but it gave up because
of technical problems. Now it, too, wants to build a centrifuge plant,
near a former gaseous diffusion plant in Ohio. It has a license to build
a pilot plant, which it needs to persuade bankers to finance the
project, but its application to license a full-scale plant is about a
year behind that of Louisiana Energy Services.

The Louisiana Energy plant would duplicate centrifuge technology in use
in Europe. Uranium, mixed with fluorine and heated to a gas, is spun in
a metal tube at more than 1,000 revolutions per second. Uranium 235, the
kind that splits easily in a reactor, flows to the center, as uranium
238, which is heavier, flows to the outside.

In natural uranium, the proportion of U 235 is about 0.7 percent; for
reactors it is raised to 3 percent to 5 percent. For weapons it is
commonly pushed above 90 percent. The plant here, which would not begin
to produce enriched uranium until late 2008, would be open to inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the builders say.

A critical issue in hearings here this week before the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission is what would happen to the depleted uranium, from
which the U 235 had been removed. Louisiana Energy says it has a
preliminary agreement with a nuclear services company to take the
fluorine out of the mixture. The remaining uranium oxide, which is
chemically nonreactive, could be buried in the Texas landfill. It could
also be turned over to the Energy Department, which already has about
700,000 tons of depleted uranium, still mixed with fluorine and much of
it in decaying metal canisters, in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.

Two antinuclear groups - the Nuclear Information and Resource Service,
and Public Citizen - hired a consultant, Arjun Makhijani, who asserted
at the hearings that the depleted uranium had emissions similar to
plutonium and that there was no proven means for safe disposal.

A Louisiana Energy Services spokesman, Marshall Cohen, said the depleted
uranium was "less radioactive than when it came out of the ground."
Opponents say that may be so, but it is no longer in the ground, and
thus a problem.

Hearings in the fall will examine whether the technology is safe and
whether the company will set aside enough money for cleanup. Two
commercial fuel processing plants have become federal liabilities.

Supporters say the plant would modernize nuclear fuel production and cut
its costs.

Mr. Cohen said that 70 percent of the plant's first 10 years of
production had been sold and that the plant would be viable whether or
not any new reactors were built. The last time a reactor was ordered in
this country and not canceled was 1973.

The plant would enrich enough uranium to make about 5 percent of the
electricity used in the country.

Although Governor Richardson has said that the waste problem is central,
local sentiment seems favorable. The plant would run for 30 years and
according to Louisiana Energy would provide 210 permanent jobs with an
annual payroll of $10 million, including benefits, a substantial sum
amid the region's fields of peanuts and cotton, interspersed with oil
and gas wells.

Harry Teague, who is chairman of the Lea County Commission and whose
business is oilfield services, said the oil and gas business was strong
but added, "Hobbs has always been a boom-and-bust town."

Existing local industry is dangerous, Mr. Teague said, citing the
hydrogen sulfide gas that rises with methane out of most natural gas
wells here. Nuclear fuel is not risk free, he said, but "it's not near
as bad as hydrogen sulfide."

Wind Power Is Becoming a Better Bargain
By MATTHEW L. WALD

Published: February 13, 2005

HOUSE, N.M., Feb. 10 - With every turn of the giant blades of the 136
windmills here on the edge of a mesa, the stiff desert breeze is
replacing expensive natural gas or other fuel that would have been
burned in a power plant somewhere else.

Wind energy makes up a small fraction of electric generation in this
country, but the rising price of natural gas has made wind look like a
bargain; in some cases, it is cheaper to build a wind turbine and let
existing natural gas generators stand idle. Giant, modern wind farms
like the New Mexico Wind Energy Center here may become more common if
prices continue to rise.

Advertisement

The center, 150 miles east of Albuquerque, opened in the summer of 2003
and is one of the largest in the country. The power is bought by the
state's largest utility, Public Service of New Mexico, and provides
about 4 percent of that company's electricity over the course of a year.
In March, when demand is low and winds are usually strong, the project
generates 10 percent of the electricity the company supplies. The state
has established a goal of using 10 percent renewable energy by 2011. The
governor, Bill Richardson, a former secretary of energy, has said that
New Mexico could become "the Saudi Arabia of renewables."

Across the country, the increase in gas prices has made a fundamental
difference in the purchasing decisions of utility companies, said
Michael A. O'Sullivan, senior vice president of FPL Energy, which owns
and operates the New Mexico center.

"Gas prices helped get - pardon the pun - the wind at our backs," he
said in a telephone interview from the company headquarters in Juno
Beach, Fla. At $6 per million B.T.U.'s, the standard unit in which gas
prices are quoted, the fuel needed to produce a kilowatt-hour costs more
than 5 cents at an inefficient gas plant, and more than 4 cents at the
most efficient plants.

Last fall, Congress restored the Production Tax Credit, worth 1.8 cents
per kilowatt-hour after taxes, for wind energy projects completed by the
end of 2005. Counting that credit, Mr. O'Sullivan said, his company
sells wind energy for 3 to 5 cents a kilowatt-hour.

The tax credit and steeper natural gas prices are driving the increased
interest in wind energy. But there are problems, even supporters say.

"One of the things the wind folks do not talk about is when the wind
blows," said George E. Kehler, manger of alternative and renewable
energy at Dow Chemical.

West Texas, for example, is notoriously windy, but mostly at night and
in the winter, when the electric market is glutted with cheap power from
coal and nuclear plants. Peak electric load, and peak use of gas in
electricity generators, occurs in summer, during the day.

One solution, Mr. Kehler said, may be to put windmills on the Texas
coast, which may not be quite as windy, but where the windiest periods
happen during daylight hours.

Dow is a strong supporter of wind-generated energy as one strategy to
drive down the price of natural gas, which the company uses as a fuel
and as an ingredient for chemical manufacturing.

Another problem, if wind energy becomes more popular, is output
reliability. The New Mexico Wind Energy Center output of up to 206
megawatts is 8 percent of what all the company's generators would
produce if they were all running at full capacity.

"That is enormous," said Don Brown, a spokesman for Public Service, who
said it was a record among American utilities.

But most of the year the wind is not blowing nearly hard enough to make
206 megawatts. Mr. Brown said his company was not certain how much more
heavily it could depend on wind energy without the threat of blackouts.

The variability was obvious here on Thursday morning, with wind that
looked to be suitable for kite flying, but which the center's employees
said was weak. A control room display showed the wind blowing at 5.5
meters a second (about 12 miles an hour) and the "swooshing" from the
110-foot-long blades was slow, turning at about 16 revolutions a minute
instead of the optimum 20. The plant was producing only about 25
megawatts, or one-eighth of its capacity.

State wants its share in nuclear waste deal
But some worry Texas will become a dumping ground for the materials
By JEFFREY GILBERT
Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau

RESOURCES
---  Complete coverage: See more stories and resources on the 79th Texas 
Legislature from the Houston Chronicle.

AUSTIN - The debate among lawmakers over low-level nuclear waste storage
has shifted from whether there should be such a facility in West Texas
to how much money the state should get from it.

But environmentalists are warning that Texas could become the nation's
nuclear dumping ground if the debate stays too focused on money.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists- owned by major Republican
donors Harold Simmons of Dallas and former Railroad Commissioner Kent
Hance- fought unsuccessfully for years to persuade a
Democratic-controlled Legislature to allow the state to license a
private operator to run a low-level nuclear waste facility in rural
Andrews County. The legislation finally passed in 2003 when Republicans
took control of the Texas House.

With billions of dollars in profits at stake, state lawmakers wanted to
make certain Texas gained financially from the deal that was being
granted to Waste Control. So lawmakers included in the bill a
requirement that 10 percent of the gross revenue from the facility be
divided equally between the state and Andrews County.

Now, Waste Control is lobbying to bring millions of pounds of a
different type of radioactive material, made mostly of uranium mill
tailings, to the county. Texas law does not give the state any
compensation from revenue provided from this type of waste, and
legislators aren't happy about it.

"The camel's nose is under the tent and I think you'll see that it is
our job to make sure that if the camel is under the tent, then we are
with it," said Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock.

Increase in volume
The material Waste Control wants to bring in, which would come from the
U.S. Department of Energy's Fernald Environmental Management Project in
Ohio, is not necessarily any more radioactive than the low-level waste
it stores now. The difference is that the byproduct from the new waste
comes from uranium mills.

The volume of waste the Andrews facility can currently hold would not
allow it to accept the new waste, which would fill up about 800 train
cars. So the company has asked the state health department for an
amendment to its current license to increase the volume of waste the
facility can store.

"Under the existing license, we already can store this type of
material," said George Dials, Waste Control president and chief
operating officer. "But we don't have the storage space for it right
now, and that is why we want the amendment."

Waste Control is paying lobbyists as much as $450,000 to press its
interests before the Legislature this year.

Health department decision
Duncan and 14 state senators sent a letter to the state health
department last month asking it to delay a decision. However, the health
department could announce one any time.

Duncan said he hopes that health officials will continue to hold off on
making a decision until the Legislature can discuss the issue further.

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said he supports Duncan's complaint that the
state should receive compensation if the radioactive waste comes to
Andrews.

"I'm looking for a revenue source for the state and probably the
county," Dewhurst said.

He said he asked Duncan and committee chair Sen. Ken Armbrister,
D-Victoria, to look into determining how much the state should benefit.
He said the minimum should be 5 percent, the same as what the state
receives for low-level radioactive waste.

Duncan said 5 percent wasn't enough. The state should receive at least
10 percent of the gross revenue, he said, plus a surcharge based on a
number of additional factors.

There are no estimates on how much this type of waste could bring into
the state, but it is assumed to be in the millions of dollars. Duncan
said South Carolina generates about $24 million per year from a similar
site.

Dials would not comment on whether the state should receive compensation
for the uranium mill tailings. He said his company benefits the state in
other ways, citing the nearly 100 jobs the company has created in
Andrews County.

'Financial benefit' sought
The letter the senators wrote to the health department said Texas is the
only state being considered to hold the waste. Other states that could
accept the hazardous material - Utah, Nevada and South Carolina - are
not fighting for it, Duncan said.

"If Texas is going to be the radioactive waste disposal site of last
resort for the Department of Energy, then it should receive a
substantial financial benefit for its willingness to serve the nation
and/or the nuclear energy industry in this way," the letter said.

Dials said his company is in fact competing with other groups for the
waste. He would not disclose the financial details, but he did say that
it is a multimillion-dollar contract, and it would be about one-fifth of
its revenue.

A spokesman for the Fernald site said a decision would not be made for a
few weeks.

Robert Zap, mayor of the city of Andrews, estimates that about 95
percent of its residents do not oppose the waste. He said there are many
benefits of having it so close, the main one being employment.

"There is no question there is a great need for this material to be at a
safe place and we feel we have one here. It's not a major worry," Zap
said.

Considering consequences
Cyrus Reed, a lobbyist with the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club,
said there are too many proposals coming too fast to bring the waste to
Texas. He said the legislators need to look at the long-term
consequences.

"I think it is important to look at this waste as the tip of the
iceberg," Reed said. "The public needs to know that unless action is
taken by this Legislature, Andrews County will become the first and last
repository for radioactive waste for the country."

The Sierra Club would like Gov. Rick Perry to appoint a special blue
ribbon committee to take these issues into consideration before allowing
the uranium mill tailings to be dumped in Andrews County, Reed said.

Duncan is close to filing a bill that would set up a mechanism for
determining state compensation for this type of radioactive waste, which
would start at 10 percent of the gross revenue.

"If we don't intervene, the waste could come to Texas as soon as (the
health department) grants the license," Duncan said. "That certainly
muddies the water politically. (If they rule), it takes the state of
Texas away from the negotiating table."

Duncan expresses concerns about waste facility expansion

by Katherine Amerson
February 14, 2005

Waste Control Specialists LLC is requesting an expansion at an Andrews
County radioactive waste disposal facility, but state Sen. Robert
Duncan, R-Lubbock, has concerns about the plans.

Deon Daugherty, communications director for Duncan, said the facility in
Andrews County is already running, but the technical aspects of the
expansion pose some problems.

"What Sen. Duncan is concerned about is their application to bring in
11E2 waste, a different classification of radioactive wastes," she said.
"The 11E2 stuff is uranium tailings; it's a byproduct of the Manhattan
Project bombs of the 1950s."

The Manhattan Project was a World War II effort to develop nuclear
weapons, according to Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality governs the low-level
waste already in Andrews County, Daugherty said, but the entity that
should have jurisdiction over the new waste is the Texas Department of
State Health Services.

Another concern Duncan has, Daugherty said, is taxpayer compensation for
having the material in Texas.

"If this material is going to come into the state of Texas, the
taxpayers should get a benefit for hosting the site," she said.

There is already some 11E2 material in Texas, Daugherty said, but it is
a different grade.

"My understanding is that (Waste Control Specialists LLC is) bidding on
it," she said. "But, the Department of Energy hasn't decided how it will
appropriate the bid."

The bid still is undecided, Daugherty said, but she stressed that
Duncan's concerns were not about the safety of the project.

"The scientists say no, that this is a safe site," she said. "(But the
material has a) half-life of 1,000 years, so it's hard to tell."

However, Texas Tech environmental history professor Mark Stoll said
there is some environmental trepidation in regard to the waste.

"I understand that there's concern that it might leak into the ground
water," he said. "Radioactive groundwater is not something you want."

The site is not above the Ogallala Aquifer, Stoll said, but the waste
has a tendency to move, so there is the possibility of infecting the
water supply.

"It's not necessarily the best (location) geographically," he said. "It
seems kind of suspicious the way it's being set up."

Transport is another issue with the waste, Stoll said, because the only
methods of transport are by car or train, neither of which are accident
free.

"Somebody's making money out of this," he said. "There is more politics
than science, (which is environmentally hazardous)."

Susan Jablonski, a radioactive waste specialist with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality, said Waste Control Specialists LLC
is applying for low-level radioactive waste disposal authority.

"Our involvement is they currently have a permit for the treatment,
storage and disposal of hazardous waste," she said. "They currently have
a license for storage and processing with a sister company, State Health
Services, (and are) seeking to get it amended."

The proposal for the uranium tailings, Jablonski said, is to store them
above ground.

"We look at every aspect of human and environmental concerns," she said.
"The first precaution is the waste form itself."

The TCEQ looks at when the material will go into a site, how the waste
will behave over time, ground water, surface water, vegetation,
meteorology, mineral interests, how the natural site would behave over
time and even engineering design of the facility, Jablonski said.

"(For an underground storage facility), it's not just a hole in the
ground," she said. "In our state law, there's a requirement to add
concrete barriers."

Waste Control Specialists LLC already has the bid for silo three, a
housing facility for less radioactive waste, Daugherty said, but this
bid is for silos one and two. If the expansion was approved, it most
likely would happen this legislative session, she said.

John Robinson, a freshman mechanical engineering major from Odessa, said
he is somewhat concerned about the issue and would feel a little unsafe
if this was happening in Lubbock.


"Bad things in the past have happened with radioactive waste," he said.
"I heard about (this) about a month or two ago."

Robinson said he frequents a restaurant in Andrews County and believes
the people there have mixed feelings about the waste.

Numerous attempts were made to contact someone at Waste Control
Specialists LLC, but no one was available for comment.

The leaking fluid is water from the safety injections system that would
be used during an emergency shut down.

The unit is being shut down so crews can repair the leak. The shutdown
process should be completed by Thursday. Once the unit is shut down and
cooled, officials will determine the cause and take corrective action.
No word yet on how long the unit will be out of service.

No one has been injured, and there is no risk to public safety or
employees. No radiation was released.

Officials say the availability of electricity won't be a concern with
the temporary shutdown because there's plenty of reserve power.

Unit at nuclear plant near Bay City shutting down due to leak

10:12 AM CST on Thursday, February 10, 2005

From 11 News Staff Reports

BAY CITY, Texas -- A reactor at the South Texas Project nuclear facility
was being shut down Wednesday after the discovery of a small water leak
in its coolant system.

KHOU-TV

The reactor was shut down Wednesday afternoon and plant officials said
it would not reopen for days.

Officials at the nuclear plant, located about 100 miles southwest of
Houston, said there was no release of radiation and no danger to the
public.

Sensitive instruments used to monitor for leaks indicated earlier this
week there might be a problem with Unit 2, said Mark McBurnett, manager
of nuclear safety assurance at the facility.

The leak was confirmed on Wednesday by a robotic camera and the shut
down process began around noon.

McBurnett said the leak is releasing the superheated water, which
actually comes out in the form of steam, at a rate of 1/10 of a gallon
per minute.

"We are following normal procedures to address this issue," he said.
"Once the unit is shut down and cooled down, we will determine the cause
and take corrective action."

The shut down process should be completed by noon Thursday. McBurnett
said he could not estimate how long the unit would be out of service.
However, the repairs should be fairly straightforward, he said.

The repairs should be easier, McBurnett said, than the ones associated
with a leak in Unit 1 found in April 2003.

Unit 1 was idled for several months in 2003 after an inspection detected
a tiny deposit containing boric acid -- described as about half the size
of an aspirin -- on the bottom of the containment area of the reactor
vessel.

Repairs were completed in July 2003. Plant managers said their
investigation suggested the leak was the result of a problem during
original fabrication.

In December 2003, a backup diesel generator failed during a routine
test.

Plant workers believe a flawed rod had microcracks that expanded and
eventually resulted in the generator's failure.

The nuclear plant has been providing power to more than 1 million homes
in southeast and south central Texas since Unit 1 went into service in
August 1988. Unit 2 began producing power 10 months later.

The availability of electricity won't be a concern with the temporary
shut down of Unit 2 because the state has plenty of reserve power,
McBurnett said.

Source of leak found at South Texas nuclear plant

Associated Press

BAY CITY, Texas - Officials at the South Texas Project nuclear plant on
Thursday found the source of a water leak that shut down a reactor at
the facility a day earlier.

The leak was located at a weld connecting a 3/4-inch pipe to a valve in
the reactor's coolant system.

A team of workers was able to enter Unit 2 Thursday morning and pinpoint
the leak. The team is working to determine the leak's cause, develop a
repair plan and take steps to prevent a recurrence.

It was not immediately known how long the reactor would be shut down for
repairs.

Officials at the nuclear plant, located about 100 miles southwest of
Houston, said there was no release of radiation and no danger to the
public.

Sensitive instruments used to monitor for leaks indicated earlier this
week there might be a problem with Unit 2.

Officials said the leak released the superheated water, which actually

Bay City Tribune

Published February 16, 2005

Repairs on the pressurized water reactor that sprang a leak last week at
the South Texas Project electric generating station on FM 521 were
completed Sunday and the unit is scheduled to be back online soon.

The Unit 2 reactor was shut down last Wednesday after officials found a
small water leak inside the reactor containment building.

The leak was discovered inside the domed containment unit near a steam
generator through normal monitoring operations.

After it was confirmed by a robotic camera, officials began shutting the
reactor down Wednesday afternoon.

The leak was losing about one-tenth of a gallon per minute and was
pinpointed Thursday morning at a weld connecting a three-quarter inch
pipe to a valve in the reactor coolant system.

The leak was blamed on a small defect in the weld, said STP spokesman Ed
Conaway.

The affected pipes were cut out and capped fittings were installed,
Conaway said.

No definite time has been given for the unit to be back online, but the
company is preparing to restart it.

There was no release of radiation in conjunction with the leak  and no
danger to employees or the public.

The Unit 1 reactor remains online.

Together, the twin reactors produce 2,500 megawatts of electricity  enough 
to supply more than one million homes.

N.M. Desert Town Stakes Future on Uranium
In a New Mexico Desert Town, Residents Stake Their Future on $1.3 Billion Uranium Plant
By PETER BARNES
The Associated Press

Feb. 16, 2005 - Like many others in this former boomtown, Mayor James
Brown knows more about isotopes, centrifuges and uranium-235 than your
average college student.

Brown's recent crash course in nuclear physics was a prerequisite: Many
of his constituents are counting on the jobs and economic trickle-down
that are being promised if a $1.3 billion uranium enrichment plant that
would make fuel for nuclear power plants comes to town.

Critics say the proposed National Enrichment Facility could pollute the
environment, guzzle scarce water and leave this oil-producing town with
tons of radioactive waste and nowhere to put it.

But the mayor warns that without the plant, Eunice faces extinction.

"We have to have something else in place or communities like Eunice and
Jal will just disappear," he said. "The oil industry won't be able to
support our economy 20 or 30 years from now."

The project would be the first privately operated uranium enrichment
plant in the United States and the first U.S. installation to use
centrifuge technology, rather than a process known as gaseous diffusion
that has been around since the Manhattan Project.

Louisiana Energy Services, the international consortium behind the
plant, wanted to build the project in rural Louisiana, but backed out in
1998 after opponents accused it of targeting a predominantly poor and
black parish. Then it pulled out of Hartsville, Tenn., in 2003 after
running into opposition from former Vice President Al Gore and others.

The new proposed site is in the flat, scrub-covered desert 340 miles
from Albuquerque in the southeastern corner of the state, close to the
Texas line. LES has promised that the plant would employ 400 workers
during the construction phase and, once it is up and running, 210
people, with a payroll of more than $10 million and an average salary of
$50,000.

Last week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board held public meetings on the LES plan. At one, Lea County
Commissioner Darrold Stephenson made his point by flipping the lights
off.

If the project is turned down, "this is what we're passing on to our
future generations: nothing," the 70-year-old commissioner said later.

Oil and natural gas have been the region's lifeblood for decades. Today,
bobbing oil pumps and high-pressure gas lines are woven into Eunice's
modest street grid.

But many oil-related jobs are disappearing because of new labor-saving
technology, and companies have discovered more lucrative oil fields
elsewhere. Since 1985, Eunice's population has fallen by a third, to
2,500.

The uranium enrichment plant would be the biggest commercial nuclear
project in the United States in years. The nuclear industry is watching
the project's fate closely, said Marshall Cohen, an LES spokesman.

"If it's a good, steady, on-track process, that's encouraging to others
who might want to look at nuclear-related construction. Because it's
very expensive the amount of money spent on obtaining the license is
serious money," he said.

Townspeople in Eunice overwhelmingly support the project. Some have
grown tired of environmentalists and other out-of-towners preaching
doom, and many note that they have lived with industrial hazards all
their lives.

"Don't tell me how dangerous this is when I grew up in this oil field,"
said Fay Thompson, owner of The Bakery and More restaurant on Main
Street. Compared to working with oil, the plant is a "walk in the park,"
Thompson said.

Her husband, she said, died 40 years ago of cancer related to benzene, a
petroleum byproduct.

Still, a few in town are skeptical.

"We're such a gullible lot here, what can I say?" said Rose Gardner,
owner of Desert Rose Flowers and Gifts. "The whole world knows the
negative side, but Lea County doesn't seem to know it."

Environmentalists worry that radioactive material could seep into the
groundwater and the air. Moreover, they say, uranium processing
generates a type of waste that currently cannot be dumped anywhere in
the United States. With processing, it could be sent to a low-level
nuclear waste dump.

Currently, no U.S. processing facility can do that. A French company has
offered to build such a plant in this country, but it will be years
before it even applies for a license.

Gov. Bill Richardson, who was energy secretary in the Clinton
administration, has indicated his support for the project is contingent
on an assurance the waste will be sent out of the state.

Mike Sheehan, an economist hired by Nuclear Information and Resource
Service, an anti-nuclear group, also said the new plant would undercut
financially an anti-proliferation program in Russia that takes
weapons-grade uranium and turns it into power plant fuel.

Other critics point out that the United States discourages the same kind
of plants in places like Iran, which might use them to produce uranium
for nuclear weapons.

LES Announces Contract With South Texas Project

Distribution Source : PRNewswire

Date : Wednesday - February 16, 2005

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- South Texas Project (STP)
will have an economic and local supply of enriched uranium from the
National Enrichment Facility (NEF) that will support its operation
through its current licensed life according to an announcement made by
Louisiana Energy Services (LES) today.

"This contract continues to demonstrate the need for a gas centrifuge
uranium enrichment facility within the United States," said Jim Ferland,
President of LES. "The NEF will decrease the United States' dependence
on enriched uranium from overseas by providing a domestic commercial
source of nuclear fuel for our electric generators."

Under terms of the agreement, STP will procure enrichment services
through at least 2026 to support operation until its current Nuclear
Regulatory Commission license expires in 2028, while LES will enjoy a
long-term commitment to supply fuel to one of the United States' newest
nuclear plants. ADVERTISEMENT

The nuclear power industry has long supported increased competition in
the United States' uranium enrichment marketplace. The NEF will, for the
first time, provide an alternative domestic source and competitive fuel
supply -- a key component in national energy security.

The NEF will provide 210 permanent jobs and more than 400 multi-year
construction jobs in southeast New Mexico. It will use a proven
technology that has operated safely in Europe for 30 years.

When the license application is approved, the NEF will introduce the
world's most advanced uranium enrichment technology into the United
States and provide an alternative, domestic enrichment supply source to
United States' nuclear energy companies.

LES is a partnership of major nuclear energy companies. Partners include
Urenco, Westinghouse and U.S. energy companies Duke Power, Entergy and
Exelon.

THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
Two Wealthy Texans Refuel Swift Boat Attack Ads
 
   Stephen Braun and Lisa Getter, Times Staff Writers

WASHINGTON Ñ A political action group of Vietnam War veterans that has
attacked Democratic candidate John F. Kerry over his combat record has
begun a new television and direct mail blitz, enriched by $3 million in
contributions from two longtime financial supporters of President Bush
and the Republican Party.

In filings with the Federal Election Commission last week, officials of
the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth disclosed two $1-million donations
from Harold Simmons, a billionaire chemical and waste industry magnate,
and another $1 million from oilman T. Boone Pickens. Both base their
corporate empires in the Dallas area.

The mammoth donations are the latest evidence of how Republicans and
Democrats are capitalizing on unlimited contributions flowing to 527
political action groups. The Swift boat veterans operation has been one
of the most conspicuous examples of the growing use of tax-exempt
independent groups by both parties as stalking horses to advance
controversial ad campaigns.

Simmons and Pickens have provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in
donations to GOP candidates and committees.

Pickens had already given the Swift boat group $500,000. And Simmons
contributed more than $90,000 to Bush's two Texas gubernatorial races.

With its treasury swelled by the two Texans, the Swift boat group has
launched a new cycle of campaign ads claiming that Kerry "betrayed his
fellow veterans" by meeting with "enemy" Vietnamese negotiators in Paris
during the Vietnam War.

In the ad, two wives of former prisoners of war rebuke Kerry for his
April 1971 antiwar speech to a U.S. Senate committee, which first
brought him national fame.

Mary Jane McManus, who is identified as one of the POW wives, says that
Kerry gave "aid and comfort to the enemy." A second woman is identified
as Phyllis Galanti, whose husband, Paul, is a former POW who was
appointed by the Bush administration to a Veterans Affairs advisory
council and who had criticized Kerry in an earlier campaign ad.

During his 1971 speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry
talked about private meetings he had attended the previous May in Paris
with representatives from the U.S.-backed South and communist North
Vietnamese governments.

Kerry advocated an immediate pullout during his Senate appearance, but
he has since denied any intent to intervene in the peace process,
shepherded by the Nixon administration. Kerry attended the meetings
while on his honeymoon in France, but it is not clear how he happened to
meet with delegation members.

The anti-Kerry ads are running on national cable and in the battleground
states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Mexico. Sean McCabe, a spokesman
for the Swift boat group, described the $1.4-million effort as "the most
expensive media buy the group has made to date."

McCabe said the operation had also begun a nationwide direct mail
campaign aimed at 1.2 million voters.

The Swift boat group's latest burst of activity and funding was
dismissed Monday by Kerry aides, who have long complained of collusion
between the Bush campaign and the anti-Kerry veterans. Democrats have
bridled all summer over the Swift boat group's questioning of Kerry's
medals and battle accounts. The charges were heavily covered in the
media but remain unsubstantiated by military records and key
eyewitnesses.

"Given the national laughingstock this discredited group is, you would
have thought that the Bush-Rove money men would have invested in
something more reliable and useful, like snake oil," said Kerry campaign
spokesman Michael Meehan.

Calls to a Bush campaign spokesman were not returned. Neither of the
Texas business executives could be reached for comment. A Simmons
spokeswoman said the two men were "business friends."

With holdings that include chemicals and sugar, Simmons' net worth is
reportedly $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine's annual survey of
financial wealth. Pickens is close behind at $750 million.

Simmons' Waste Control Specialists firm won permission this year from
the Texas Health Department in its efforts to dispose of low-level
nuclear waste in West Texas. Environmentalists are fighting the
decision.

In 1993, he paid a penalty of $19,800 to the Federal Election Commission
for exceeding the $25,000 annual contribution limit in 1988 federal
elections by nearly $45,000. The fine was paid after a conciliation
agreement with the FEC.

With their support of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Simmons and Pickens
join a growing list of multimillion-dollar donors to the 527 groups in
this election. Unlike political parties, 527 groups Ñ named for a
section of the Internal Revenue Service code covering political
organizations Ñ are governed by the tax code and can accept unlimited
contributions from individuals, corporations and unions.

"This would be a convenient way for Harold Simmons to score some points
for George Bush without being directly connected to the campaign," said
Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, a
nonprofit policy and research group based in Austin.

Republicans at first filed complaints with the FEC alleging that liberal
527 groups were violating the campaign finance reform law.

But after the FEC ruled in May that it would not reign in the 527s this
year, Republicans began forming their own groups. Chief among them were
the Swift boat group, which has raised more than $8.7 million from
wealthy donors in Texas and 65,000 small contributors, and Progress for
America Voter Fund, which shares some of the same donors and has raised
$30.7 million since June.

Going Nuclear in West Texas

BY FORREST WILDER


Like nuclear waste, bad ideas never seem to go away. Long-time Observer
readers will remember the decades-long knock-down drag-out fights over
where to put a radioactive waste dump. The last major episode was in
1998, when an unusually effective citizen-led campaign succeeded in
persuading the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (now the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)) to deny the license
for a low-level radioactive waste dump in Sierra Blanca. Oddly, not just
the people of Texas celebrated this victory. A particularly aggressive
and well-connected private outfit, Waste Control Specialists (WCS),
backed by Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, saw opportunity in the
Sierra Blanca site's demise. Now, because of WCS's deep pockets, deeper
political connections, and dogged persistence, Texas could soon find
itself the national dumping ground for state and federal, commercial and
governmental nuclear waste.

On February 1, Sen. Robert Duncan (R-Lubbock), whose district lies near
WCS-owned land in Andrews County in West Texas, organized a hearing for
the Senate Committee on Natural Resources. Chair Sen. Ken Armbrister
(D-Victoria), who accepted $2,500 in campaign contributions in 2004 from
WCS interests, called it a "fact-finding mission." Sen. Duncan was
intent on getting to the bottom of just what WCS was up to. He and
several other senators seemed blindsided by WCS's multiple (and
multiplying) schemes to accept state and federal radioactive waste
streams. Under legislation passed in 2003, WCS has a license to process,
store, and dispose of hazardous and toxic materials at its mammoth site
in Andrews County, near the New Mexico border. Now WCS is back asking
for more. As Sen. Duncan related, the company has several pending
applications into the TCEQ and the Department of State Health Services
(DSHS) that, if approved, would vastly expand WCS's fledgling
radioactive empire in West Texas.

One of the DSHS licenses would allow WCS to begin accepting the
leftovers from a retired bomb plant in Fernald, Ohio, for permanent
storageÑsome 10 million cubic feet to be brought in on an estimated 800
railcars. This Ohio nuclear waste is at least four times (and up to 140
times) more radioactive than the average gram of uranium waste,
according to Richard Ratliff, chief of the bureau of radiation control
of DSHS. The TCEQ license would also allow WCS to permanently dispose of
Texas' (and other states') commercial radioactive waste as well as
federal low-level radioactive waste. Additionally, WCS has its eyes on a
proposed uranium enrichment facility right across the border in New
Mexico that could conveniently hand over its by-productÑdepleted
uraniumÑto WCS for disposal. WCS, a company that consistently reports
quarterly losses to the Securities and Exchange Commission, stands to
make billions of dollars from these deals. The state and the people of
Texas, however, won't receive a cent on most of this revenue.

In a presentation to the committee, Sen. Duncan reviewed what transpired
in the 2003 legislative session. WCS, after years of failed attempts and
millions of dollars spent on political contributions and high-dollar
lobbyists, finally succeeded in getting a bill passed, House Bill 1567,
that catered to its interests. HB 1567 essentially authorized a private
radioactive waste facility in Texas for this state, Vermont, and
possibly others. Although it technically allowed any private company to
apply to establish the dump, WCS was the only company that was
positioned to qualify. Vermont comes into the picture because of a
"compact" agreement that states can enter into that makes one
stateÑTexas, in this caseÑa host for other states' low-level radioactive
waste. But because of a loophole, any other entityÑincluding a foreign
governmentÑcan opt into the compact with the majority consent of the
compact commissioners, according to Richard Simpson, a long-time
activist who has worked on anti-nuclear waste dump campaigns in New
Mexico and Texas.

Sen. Duncan also reminded the committee that the Legislature had
authorized a private company to process and (temporarily) store federal
low-level radioactive waste in addition to the compact waste. Sen. Mike
Jackson (R-La Porte) seemed to have forgotten this fact. "We formed the
compact to avoid being a dumping ground for the federal government," he
told George Dials, President of WCS. Dials, who was testifying in front
of the committee, gently corrected Sen. Jackson. In fact, in the lead-up
to passage of HB 1567, WCS's proxies had convinced lawmakers that
compact waste alone wouldn't generate enough revenue to keep WCS afloat,
the loophole notwithstanding. Obligingly, legislators passed the bill
without any meaningful caps on the amount of federal waste the company
can accept. As a result, WCS potentially has full access to massive
amounts of nuclear waste that the feds have been trying to unload since
the Cold War.

If Dials succeeds in landing a permit from the TCEQ for (permanent)
disposal of "low-level" radioactive waste, Andrews could be the home for
vast amounts of this waste forever. Luckily, TCEQ's permit process is
relatively stringent and a decision isn't expected until December 2007.
According to an official with TCEQ, WCS was recently issued its "third
notice of administrative deficiency." If not corrected, WCS would have
to start the licensing process all over again. TCEQ oversight of the
compact and federal low-level radioactive waste was a concession won by
Sen. Duncan in 2003. Perhaps that's why he seemed a little miffed at the
prospect of DSHSÑseen by many as a regulatory pushoverÑhandling the
application for the Fernald waste. One of Sen. Duncan's concerns is that
the agency will approve WCS's applications before the Legislature has
time to intervene. The Legislature "has never considered whether the
state of Texas should be a commercial importer of [Fernald radioactive
materials]," Duncan said at the hearing.

The twist is that WCS may not even need to get its disposal permit
granted to become the nation's repository for aging Cold War waste. A
"perfect storm" may make it one by default. On February 7, President
Bush announced major budget cuts to the environmental cleanup budget of
Fernald and two other similar facilities. According to the Alliance for
Nuclear Accountability, a grassroots network that monitors nuclear
issues, that kind of pressure forces the Department of Energy to find a
permanent home for their radioactive waste soon. Currently, the other
states that could feasibly accept Fernald-type and other low-level
radioactive wasteÑNevada, Utah, and South CarolinaÑare signaling their
intention to cut back or get out of the business.

Nevada, which is still fighting to rid itself of the Yucca Mountain
high-level waste site, has said that it will also fight any attempted
low-level importation. In a letter to the DOE, Nevada attorney general
helpfully mentioned WCS's site as an alternative. Utah, which is home to
WCS's long-time rival Envirocare, has been moving away from radioactive
dumping due to public opposition. Finally, South Carolina is eliminating
the importation of the most radioactive of the low-level waste despite
its generating an estimated $300 million in revenue for the state. That
leaves WCS holding a virtual monopoly. Sen. Duncan argues that "once we
get the [Fernald waste] here we're going to have to dispose of it most
likely," even if WCS is only permitted for storage, not disposal.

The final wild card in WCS's and Texas' radioactive future is the
proposed uranium enrichment facility that lies, in the words of Sen.
Duncan, "a nine-iron chip away from the [Texas] border" in New Mexico,
next door to WCS's facility. An initial agreement has already been inked
to create a private uranium plant that will take dangerous depleted
uranium coming from the proposed National Enrichment Facility (NEF)
outside of Eunice, New Mexico, and try to make it a little more
chemically stable.

Sen. Duncan pressed Dials on the matter. "In addition to the waste that
we authorized last session and the compact waste, potentially now
there's another source of waste that could be disposed of at your site.
We could anticipate that in 2008, you might come back to ask for an
amendment to allow you to take that waste," said Duncan. After some
hesitation, Dials responded. "Yes," he said.

And why can't the depleted uranium just stay in New Mexico? Simple: The
state and its people don't want it.

WCS is promoting its various radioactive ventures as a popular jobs
program for West Texas and a chance for Texas to seize the market in "an
emerging industry." On hand at the hearing to drive his point home was
Robert Zap, the mayor of the city of Andrews, and Russell Shannon, Vice
President of the Andrews Industrial Foundation. They recounted the hard
times their area fell on after the oil crash in the '80s, and plugged
the jobs that an expanded dump would create. What they didn't mention
was their county's zeal for high-risk holes in the ground no one else
seems to want: the national, high-level radioactive waste site (now
slated for Yucca Mountain), the failed supercolliding superconductor,
and the hazardous and toxic materials dump WSC currently operates at its
facility. Shannon told the committee of a sign outside Andrews that
promotes the area's values: God, Country, and Free Enterprise. "We hope
the Legislature takes no action to impede our growth," Dials said.

WCS has spent a lot of time and money to get to this point. They've been
helped along the way by lawmakers either too shortsighted or too
indebted to pay attention to WCS's expanding ambitions. HB 1567 allows
for a total of 162 million cubic feet of federal low-level
wasteÑvirtually all of it. In addition, the Fernald waste is estimated
to be 1.3 million cubic feet. The Sierra Club estimates that WCS could
generate $100 billion in profits on the federal waste it's already
allowed to accept, to say nothing of the waste from Ohio. That's a nice
return on the millions WCS and its affiliates have sunk into political
contributions to state and federal candidates, parties, and PACs over
the years. (According to Andrew Wheat of Texans for Public Justice,
Harold Simmons, one of the company's principals, was the state's number
four political donor in 2004, paying out $548,250. From January 1, 2003,
to late October 2004, WCS-related contributions totaled $843,200.
Several members of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources have
received significant contributions from WCS and its affiliates.)

It will be hard for a Republican senator, even one with a thoughtful
take on the issue, to undercut a company that has dispensed favors so
generously to Republican candidates. "Duncan has to realize that he's up
against some major donors," according to Colin Leyden, the Legislative
Director for Rep. Lon Burnham (D-Fort Worth). Nonetheless, the senator
from Lubbock finally seemed to get his colleagues to listen when he
broached the topic of fees for the state. Under HB 1567, Andrews County
and the state of Texas will each eventually receive 5 percent of WCS's
gross receipts from compact and federal waste, much less than the amount
South Carolina generates for similar low-level waste. However, the
Fernald waste stream would generate not a single dime for Texas under
the current fee schedule. According to Cyrus Reed, a registered lobbyist
with the Sierra Club, some lawmakers are considering imposing a 5
percent fee on the Fernald waste in order to generate revenue for
cash-strapped state coffers. Considering the tremendous pressure the
Legislature is under to come up with billions in new funding for public
schools, it's not unlikely that Texas may follow South Carolina's
example and use the fee money to fund public education. The appearance
of a quick-and-easy fix may spur lawmakers reluctant to squeeze WCS's
profits into action, quickly setting up a fee system for the incoming
radioactive waste while putting pressure on TCEQ and DSHS to expedite
WCS's applications. "Once [the waste] is a state revenue source you'll
never get rid of it," says Leyden. Left out of the mix, of course, will
be the short-term and long-term health and environmental consequences of
unloading millions of cubic feet of radioactive junk on future
generations.

New Research Indicates Health Risks from Uranium May Be More Varied Than
Reflected in Current Federal Policy Depleted Uranium from Proposed New
Mexico Enrichment Plant May Become Multi-Billion Dollar Taxpayer
Liability without a Hefty Financial Guarantee

Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Corporate Options for DU Disposal Risk
Long-Term Violation of Health and Environmental Standards, New Analysis
Indicates

TAKOMA PARK, MD, FEB. 23, 2005 Ñ A new report about a uranium enrichment
plant PDF proposed to be built in New Mexico concludes that it would
cost between $3 billion and $4 billion to properly manage and dispose of
the depleted uranium (DU) waste that the plant would generate. Such high
costs could not be recovered from the customers for enrichment services.

ADVERTISING

The report also discusses recent research on the health effects of DU,
much of it performed at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute
in Bethesda, Maryland after the 1991 Gulf War, that has implications far
wider than the New Mexico plant. The research indicates that depleted
uranium may be mutagenic, tumorigenic, teratogenic, cytotoxic, and
neurotoxic, including in a manner analogous to exposure to lead.1 It may
also cross the placenta and harm the embryo/fetus. There is also
research that indicates that the chemical and radiological toxicities of
uranium may, in some cases, be acting in a synergistic manner. Federal
regulations limit uranium inhalation based on cancer risk and drinking
water intake based mainly on kidney toxicity.

There are currently some 740,000 tons of depleted uranium in unstable
hexafluoride form stockpiled at Department of Energy sites at Paducah,
Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. LES, a corporate
consortium led by the European company Urenco, wants to build the plant
in New Mexico. Another company, USEC, seeks to build a similar plant in
Ohio.

The reportÑreleased today by the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research (IEER) and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service
(NIRS)Ñconcludes that unless LES provides at least $2.5 billion dollars
in financial guarantees, it is likely that the people of New Mexico,
U.S. taxpayers, and future generations would be stuck with a
multi-billion dollar radioactive waste liability. The report was filed
with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in late November 2004
by NIRS and the public interest group Public Citizen as part of their
legal intervention in the licensing proceeding of LES. A redacted
version excluding proprietary LES corporate financial data is being
released to the public today.

"The labeling of depleted uranium as 'low-level' waste by the NRC is not
going to diminish its dangers," said Dr. Arjun Makhijani, principal
author of the report and president of IEER. "To paraphrase Shakespeare,
dangerous radioactive waste by any other name would still pose
significant public health risks."

The report is entitled Costs and Risks of Management and Disposal of
Depleted Uranium from the National Enrichment Facility Proposed to be
Built in Lea County New Mexico by LES. It provides data showing that
depleted uranium is radiologically comparable to transuranic waste,
which is waste that is significantly contaminated with plutonium and
other long-lived radionuclides like it. Federal regulations define
transuranic waste as that which has more than 100 nanocuries per gram of
long-lived transuranic radionuclides that emit alpha radiation. DU has a
specific activity of about 400 nanocuries per gram. Transuranic waste
from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities is now being disposed of
in a deep geologic repository in New Mexico called the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, which is a multi-billion dollar federal government project.

"The people of New Mexico and the taxpayers of the United States may
find themselves saddled with enormous liabilities," said Michael
Mariotte, executive director of NIRS, which sponsored the IEER report.
"Corporations can easily wiggle out of their obligations. It happened,
for example, when Getty Oil dumped the wastes from its plutonium
reprocessing plant into the laps of the federal government and the State
of New York over three decades ago. That multi-billion dollar mess still
hasn't been fully cleaned up, and the waste has nowhere to go."

"The health risks of depleted uranium may be far more varied than is
recognized in federal regulations today," said Dr. Brice Smith, Senior
Scientist at IEER and co-author of the report. "Children in the future
may be saddled with a legacy similar to that of the sorry history of
lead poisoning over the past three generations, but this time we are
dealing with a heavy metal that is also radioactive."

The license application constitutes LES's fourth attempt to build a
uranium enrichment plant in the United States. The first attempt, which
was for a plant in Louisiana, cost LES more than $30 million. LES
withdrew the application after a citizens' group successfully challenged
the NRC's environmental impact statement for the project on
environmental justice grounds. Two other locations, both in Tennessee,
were also explored but abandoned in the face of local opposition. DU
disposal has remained a central public concern throughout.

"The NRC has so far failed to back up its claims that radiation doses
from depleted uranium disposal in an abandoned mine would be within
regulatory limits," said Dr. Makhijani. "Data-free analysis ought to be
unacceptable in any forum, but it is especially so in an environmental
impact statement prepared by a government agency charged with protecting
public health and safety."

LES may consider shallow land disposal as option; sites in Utah or in
Texas just across the border from LES site in New Mexico may be
considered. LES may elect to pay the federal government to take on its
waste. DOE is building a plant to convert DU hexafluoride to a more
stable oxide form but it has not yet identified a viable long-term
disposal strategy even for its own DU.

"Transfer to the DOE cannot be considered a solution to LES's waste
problem," said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical
Mass Energy and Environment Program. "The DOE has yet to take charge of
a single spent fuel bundle from nuclear power plant operatorsÑdespite a
legal commitment to begin in 1998 and billions of dollars in payments to
the federal government by nuclear electricity consumers."

Nuclear waste measure would plug loophole

AUSTIN Ñ A loophole that opened last session, allowing private companies
to dispose of low-level nuclear waste in Texas, would be closed under a
bill filed Monday by Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio.

House Bill 1656 would mandate that the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality license waste disposal from only parties inside the Texas
Compact, which now includes only Vermont.

Under federal law, states deal with their own low-level nuclear waste
and can either build a disposal site or contract with others to get rid
of it. But under a bill passed last session, private companies also can
apply to dump federal low-level radioactive waste in Texas.

The only company to do so, Dallas-based Waste Control Specialist, fought
for years to obtain permission to run a low-level nuclear waste facility
in Andrews County in West Texas.

The company possesses an existing license from the Texas Department of
State Health Services to store radioactive waste from uranium mills. In
addition to applying for a disposal license, it also applied to increase
the amount of waste the facility can currently hold.

Last month, Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, and 14 other senators wrote
to the state's health department asking them to delay that decision.
Duncan, for one, thinks the state needs to get paid more for keeping
other states' waste.

George Dials, Waste Control president and chief operating officer, did
not immediately return phone calls about the legislation.

The U.S. Department of Energy also has indicated interest in
transferring federal low-level radioactive waste from New Mexico and
Ohio, Villarreal said.

He also pointed to several spillage accidents in San Antonio as evidence
the transportation of nuclear waste could affect metropolitan areas as
much as the rural areas where it is stored.

Proponents say storing the waste is lucrative for the state; South
Carolina, for example, generates $24 million a year from its site.

Villarreal said that's only a "short-term benefit."

"I haven't seen any numbers related to the long-term cost of the risk of
exposure to the state of Texas and the health of our grandchildren and
great-grand children," he said.Also in the House, Rep. Pete Gallego,

79th LEGISLATURE
Lawmaker wants limit on radioactive wastes
Bill would keep most states' waste out of Texas

By Kevin Carmody
AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF
Tuesday, March 01, 2005

Legislation introduced Monday would block a proposed West Texas dump
from accepting low-level radioactive waste from any other state except
Vermont.

Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, said his bill would clarify the
intent of the Legislature when it voted in 2003 to allow the creation of
a privately operated disposal facility for the low-level radioactive
waste produced in Texas and Vermont, which have signed a disposal
compact. MORE ON THIS STORY



* Complete Legislature coverage

Villarreal said legislators were assured that radioactive wastes from
the other 48 states would be excluded. But under the Texas-Vermont
compact, a seven-member commission appointed by the two states'
governors can approve agreements allowing any state or entity to send
radioactive waste to the Texas dump.

Last year, Nebraska officials proposed paying Texas $30 million to allow
the Texas dump to accept radioactive wastes from their state and the
four others with which Nebraska has a disposal compact: Louisiana,
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas.

"Now we understand there are many more states that want to come into
Texas with their waste," Villarreal said. "We need to tighten up the
hole in our statutes."

The Legislature in 2003 also authorized the creation of a second
privately operated dump to accept low-level radioactive waste from U.S.
Department of Energy facilities. A Dallas company, Waste Control
Specialists, has applied to the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality for a permit to operate both facilities in Andrews County near
the New Mexico border.

Also Monday, state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, introduced a resolution
asking legislative leaders to create a joint committee to study the
risks associated with importing radioactive wastes from other states.
The committee would offer recommendations for legislative action next
session.

"I want to know what all the costs are before other lawmakers decide to
turn West Texas into the nation's first and last resort for radioactive
waste disposal," Gallego said.

WCS can take more waste
TCEQ sets public meeting for March 31

Odessa American

ANDREWS COUNTY Waste Control Specialists can now take in more low-level
radioactive waste after getting a license amendment from the State
Department of Health Services.

The company, which has facilities in western Andrews County, can now
take in 1.5 million cubic feet of waste compared to the 250,000 cubic
feet it could store before the amendment was granted.

The license amendment, approved Feb. 23, means Waste Control can take
low-level waste from almost anywhere, company General Manager Tom W.
Jones III said.

Jones said it would be a couple of weeks before Waste Control can gauge
customer response.

One place it was looking to get waste from is the former U.S. Department
of Energy uranium processing plant in Fernald, Ohio.

But Gary Stegner, public affairs officer for the U.S. Department of
Energy Ohio field office, said a decision on where to send waste from
Fernald's three silos wouldn't come for another three to four weeks.

But the amendment wasn't granted without restrictions. Richard Ratliff,
radiation program officer for the Department of State Health Services in
Austin, said the U.S. Department of Energy would have to provide notice
to the State Department of Health Services that the federal agency
retains ownership of the waste 30 days before Waste Control can take
waste.

Another condition is that DOE would remove the waste from Texas if there
were no disposal site in the state within two years. Waste Control has
applied for a license from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
to dispose of low-level radioactive waste.

If WCS gets the disposal license, the waste could stay at WCS, Ratliff
said. But if WCS doesn't get the license, and the waste is not off-site
or out of Texas by October 2007, Waste Control could be subject to civil
and administrative penalties, he said.

Meanwhile, Jones said TCEQ has declared Waste Control's disposal license
application "administratively complete" and has set a public meeting to
take comments for 7 p.m. March 31 at Andrews High School.

Workers claim they suffered radiation poisoning during Texas cleanup

March 10, 2005, 4:43 PM EST

ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- A group of nuclear-industry workers who helped clean
up a contaminated industrial site in Texas in 2002 claim in a federal
lawsuit they suffered serious radiation poisoning because their
Louisiana-based employer failed to provide adequate safeguards.

Eighteen people employed by subcontractors allege that Shaw Group Inc.,
based in Baton Rouge, La., created such unsafe working conditions at the
former Gulf Nuclear site in suburban Houston that many workers ended up
walking off the job.

Shaw Group failed to provide adequate protection to workers and allowed
them to suffer "excessive external and internal radiation exposure,"
according to the lawsuit filed last week at the federal court in
Rochester.

One worker, Dominic Cotroneo of Rochester, suffered health problems that
may be linked to acute radiation exposure, including hair loss, attorney
Linda Shaw said in Thursday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

"They were put in constant danger every day," Shaw said. "Some of them
have been, we believe, significantly overexposed."

The workers, six of whom reside in New York state, accuse Shaw Group of
violating federal regulations and industry standards and ignoring their
complaints about safety. The Shaw Group declined to comment on the
lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages.

The industrial site in the Houston suburb of Webster, where radioactive
sensors used in the oil industry were once made, was filled with
radioactive cesium and americium _ radiological material that federal
authorities feared could potentially be used to make "dirty bombs."

The building was cleaned up and razed and the hazardous material was
shipped to secure disposal sites.


 
 
===============================================


Radiation poisoning claimed in lawsuit

City man, 17 others say job in Texas violated federal safety law

Steve Orr
Staff writer

(March 10, 2005) Ñ In the fearful days after the September 2001
terrorist attacks, Texas authorities told their counterparts in
Washington, D.C., about a building in suburban Houston that could be
used as a terrorist's workshop.

The abandoned industrial site was filled with radioactive cesium and
americium Ñ just the sort of material that someone bent on terror could
use to make radiological "dirty bombs."

In 2002, federal authorities began to clean up and raze the building.
Within a year's time, the radioactive material was shipped off to secure
disposal facilities.

Now, however, a Rochester man and 17 other people are claiming that the
problem didn't really end there. In a lawsuit filed in state Supreme
Court here, they say they suffered serious radiation contamination while
cleaning up the site.

"They did a lot of work there, but they were put in constant danger
every day," said Linda R. Shaw, the workers' Rochester attorney. "Some
of them have been, we believe, significantly overexposed."

She said the working conditions were so unsafe that many workers left
the job because of it.

In legal papers filed March 1, the plaintiffs said the company
conducting the cleanup, Shaw Group Inc., failed to provide adequate
protection to workers and allowed them to suffer "excessive external and
internal radiation exposure."

The papers accuse Shaw Group of violating federal regulations and
industry standards and of ignoring the workers' complaints about safety.

In some cases, the plaintiffs' attorney said, radioactive contamination
was found on workers' clothing and in their vehicles and homes.

The lawyer said two workers have records verifying they were exposed to
radiation beyond that allowed by federal guidelines. Shaw Ñ who said she
has no connection to the company despite having the same name Ñ said the
lawsuit was filed after the Shaw Group failed to provide exposure
records for other workers.

Chris Sammons, a spokesman for the Shaw Group, based in Baton Rouge,
La., said Wednesday that the company does not comment on pending
litigation.

Two of the plaintiffs, including northwest Rochester resident Dominic
Cotroneo, have suffered health problems that may be linked to the
exposure, their attorney said. Among other things, Cotroneo suffered
hair loss, which can by a symptom of acute radiation exposure, Linda
Shaw said.

The workers also are concerned that they may have an increased risk of
cancer or other illnesses. The lawsuit is seeking damages plus money
that would be set aside to monitor the workers' health.

The 17 plaintiffs, who were employed by subcontractors that supplied
labor to the Shaw Group, are what are known in the nuclear power
industry as "jumpers" Ñ specially trained workers who travel from job to
job, toiling for limited amounts of time in radioactive environments at
each stop. Six plaintiffs live elsewhere in New York; the rest reside in
other states.

Richard Ratliff, who heads the radiation control unit at the Texas
Department of State Health Services, said the former Gulf Nuclear site
was a well-known problem spot whose former owner had filed bankruptcy.

The abandoned building, in the Houston suburb of Webster, had been used
to manufacture radioactive sensors used in the oil industry. It
contained raw cesium and americium as well as finished sensors.

After the terrorist attacks, state health officials worried about the
dirty-bomb potential and notified the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Ratliff said. The concern was grave enough that officials posted
guards around the site before and during the cleanup.

Though Texas officials had no formal oversight of the project, Ratliff
said he heard that some cleanup workers had suffered relatively minor
overexposure to radiation. But the exposures he heard about should not
have caused acute health problems, Ratliff said.

Pantex, state negotiating pact renewal

By JIM McBRIDE
jim.mcbride@amarillo.com
Amarillo Globe-News


Texas and Pantex officials are negotiating the renewal of a five-year,
multimillion-dollar pact that funds state and local oversight of
emergency management and Pantex environmental monitoring programs.

Roger Mulder, a spokesman for the State Energy Conservation Office, said
the current five-year agreement is set to expire this year.

"We're required to protect human health and safety and the environment
beginning at the fence line around the plant. The Department of Energy
is responsible for everything that goes on inside the fence line," he
said.

Although the agreement is under negotiation, Mulder estimates the
environmental management portion of the agreement will be about $500,000
per year and emergency response funding will run about $1 million
annually during the course of the five-year pact.

"We pick it up from the fence line out. In the case of environmental
monitoring, it's a question of the groundwater moving off site or if
there were ever any air emissions that could move off site, an
accidental detonation ... where you have radioactive materials moving
off the site, those types of things, and any emergency response," Mulder
said. "In the event of an accident at the plant, we are responsible for
setting up reception centers and evacuation routes."

In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mulder said, state
officials initially had problems receiving information from Pantex.

"As you can imagine, since 9-11 there's been a lot of focus on
information that DOE used to give us, and no longer provides," he said.

For example, DOE officials, citing security concerns, initially were
reluctant to release information about specific chemicals or materials
used at Pantex, Mulder said.

The state needed that information so emergency personnel responding to
an accident would know what type of protective gear they needed, he
said.

"For a while, Pantex decided not to release that information because it
could tell a terrorist what activity was going on at that location," he
said. "So we had to work through those sorts of things."

State officials now must review such information before it can be
released to the public, Mulder said.

Brenda Finley, a Pantex spokeswoman, said the agreement is up for
renewal and a draft of the proposed new grant is under review by various
parties. The agreement has been in place since 1989 and has been renewed
periodically since.

The original purpose of the grant, Finley said, was to support a common
interest in assuring that DOE activities do not adversely impact public
health, safety and the environment, and to promote cooperative efforts
between the DOE, the state and local governments.

The grant, she said, is divided into three separate tasks: chemical and
radiological assessment; environmental monitoring; and emergency
management.

The agreement assists the state in enhancing environmental monitoring
and independent oversight over Pantex environmental compliance data,
Finley said, and helps the DOE, state and local governments coordinate
effective emergency management programs.

The State Energy Conservation Office, she said, manages the grant for
state and local governments, including the city of Amarillo, Potter and
Randall counties, Armstrong County, Carson County, the Energy
Department/National Nuclear Security Administration and BWXT Pantex.

West Texas site to get more radioactive waste


By Scott Streater

Star-Telegram Staff Writer

Tons of radioactive waste from Ohio may soon be trucked through the
Dallas-Fort Worth region on its way to a disposal and storage site in
West Texas.

The state has approved a request by Dallas-based Waste Control
Specialists to expand the volume of low-level radioactive waste it can
store at its plant in Andrews County, northwest of Midland on the New
Mexico border.

Increasing the plant's storage capacity makes it eligible to receive
tons of radioactive waste currently stored in concrete silos at a
long-abandoned uranium-processing plant in Fernald, Ohio, near
Cincinnati.

The federal government has been trying for years to remove the Fernald
waste, in part because the concrete silos holding the waste are
deteriorating, records show.

The Department of Energy is expected this month to approve transferring
the waste to the West Texas site, said Gary Stegner, a spokesman for the
agency, which owns the Fernald site.

When it does, an estimated 3,500 tanker trucks will transport the
Fernald waste to the Andrews County site, he said. While no direct
transport route has been decided, the trucks would almost certainly come
through North Texas.

Interstate 20 is the only radioactive hazardous waste route in the
Metroplex, said Dan Kessler, assistant director of transportation for
the North Central Texas Council of Governments, a regional planning
group.

The Department of Energy has used great caution in transporting waste
from the site in the past. It will require the tons of uranium material
to be mixed with concrete and sealed in an estimated 7,000 metal
containers so that it cannot spill if an accident occurs.

Critics say trucking the material across Texas is a dangerous idea.

"We're very concerned because we don't think the safety standards are
there" for the trucks that would transport the waste, said Cyrus Reed, a
registered lobbyist with the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. "And
given the fear about terrorist cells possibly stealing nuclear material,
suddenly having all these trucks over our highways is of course a
concern."

State officials say the uranium tailings -- finely ground contaminated
sand left over from the chemical process to extract uranium -- would be
encased in concrete and difficult to access.

Officials at Waste Control Specialists -- the only company licensed to
handle radioactive waste in Texas -- could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.

Waste Control Specialists is owned by Dallas multimillionaire Harold
Simmons. Former Republican Congressman Kent Hance also has had close
ties to the company for years.

Waste Control eventually wants to permanently dispose of the uranium by
burying it at its site and has applied for a separate state license to
do so. A decision on that is not expected until the end of the year,
said Richard Ratliff, a radiation program officer in the Texas
Department of State Health Services.

The Waste Control permit is the latest development in the ongoing debate
over the disposal of nuclear waste in Texas.

In May 2003, the Legislature approved a controversial bill that paved
the way for consolidating waste from up to 60 storage sites nationwide
in Texas. This has raised concerns among some that Texas could become
the nation's nuclear waste dump.

The issue continues to be debated in the state Legislature.

Rep. Mike Villarreal, a San Antonio Democrat, has filed a bill to limit
the amount of out-of-state radioactive waste that can be disposed in
Texas. Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, has introduced a House resolution
creating a committee to study the radioactive waste issue and submit a
report to the Legislature by January 2007.

The Fernald waste has a long and troubled history.

The plant opened in 1951 and for four decades produced high-purity
uranium metal, mostly for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.

In 1991, after the end of the Cold War, demand for uranium dropped, and
Congress closed the Fernald site.

Uranium waste has been stored at the site since 1952. The waste includes
high concentrations of radium 226, a human carcinogen linked to bone and
nasal cancer, as well as thorium, which is linked to lung cancer,
according to federal records.

As recently as August, the Energy Department was pushing to bury the
waste at the Nevada Test Site north of Las Vegas.

Nevada officials rejected the request.

So did Utah in 2003 at its White Mesa uranium mill on the state's
southeastern corner.

Now it's likely headed for Texas, a possibility that concerns state Rep.
Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, a vocal opponent of the Waste Control plan.

"We should be worried about the fact that the ultimate graveyard for
most of the nation's nuclear waste is going to be in West Texas, and
most of it is going to come through the Dallas-Fort Worth area," he
said. "The only question is where and when is there going to be some
sort of accident." Scott Streater, (817) 390-7657

No Nukes? How About Just Fewer Nukes?
BY WELLS DUNBAR
Last week, Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, took the first swing in
fighting the importation of out-of-state radioactive waste into Texas.
His HB 1656 would close a loophole in Texas law allowing for the
importation of radioactive waste from across the nation, while HCR 85
puts the breaks on importation, calling for further examination of the
nature of the waste.

Under current law, states enter into compacts with others to create
consolidated nuclear waste disposal sites. Texas' partners are Maine and
Vermont. But last summer, a briefing document from Gov. Rick Perry's
office drove an 18-wheeler through holes in the compact. Unlike our
current partners, which are limited in what they can unload, the
briefing doc opens up a loophole that allows other states and entities
outside the compact to import as much low-level radioactive waste into
our cash-strapped, tax-slashing state as the Capitol can handle.
"Agreements made with a person, state, regional body, or group of states
are not subject to É limitation," it reads.

Villarreal's HB 1656 rectifies this by only allowing importation of
waste from our initial compact partners. "We can't open our doors and
become the primary radioactive waste dump for the entire United States,"
said Villarreal in a press release. "I filed these bills to make sure we
all live up to the intent of the laws that regulate how we dispose of
radioactive waste."

A separate resolution, HCR 85, would create a committee to study all the
waste streams coming into Texas outside the compact. This includes nuke
gunk from the likes of GOP contributor Harold Simmons' Waste Control
Specialists, said Colin Leyden, legislative director for Rep. Lon
Burnam, D-Fort Worth. Leyden, concerned with WCS's carte blanche in
importing waste since the passage of HB 1567 paved the way for private
companies to manage waste, continued that Sen. Robert L. Duncan,
R-Lubbock, "is apparently trying to work out some kind of a tax deal [to
import] Fernald, Ohio's waste." Leyden described the potential revenue
as a dance with the devil, saying, "Once you tax it, you're going to end
up with school districts and teachers lobbying the capitol, trying to
import more radioactive waste." Calls to Duncan were not returned.

Of HCR 85, Leyden said, "We're looking for someone to file that
resolution in the Texas Senate," knowing it steps on a few toes. "They
have that whole gentlemanly way over there," Leyden lamented, saying
Sen. Kenneth Armbrister, D-Victoria, is a big booster of importation,
being a driving force behind HB 1567. "I think everyone is scared" of
crossing the Natural Resources chair, he said. Calls to Armbrister also
were not returned.

 Bill would give state part of radioactive waste profits
Associated Press
03/11/2005

A West Texas lawmaker wants the state to cash in on tons of Department
of Energy radioactive waste if it's dumped at an Andrews County storage
site.

Advertisement External Systems - Linking Your Business Together Sen.
Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, filed a bill Friday that would require a
company handling the waste to pay the state 10 percent of gross receipts
for storage, processing and disposal, plus a surcharge based on the
level of radioactivity.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists is the only company that has
applied to handle tons of federal uranium byproduct waste at the site in
Andrews, near the New Mexico border.

A bill similar to Duncan's was passed in South Carolina, and he said it
brings in about $24 million a year. He did not estimate what Texas might
receive.

"I think Texas would benefit from that, and it would be a significant
revenue source," he said.

Mike Woodward, an attorney who represents the waste company, said the
company doesn't oppose the 10 percent fee but is concerned about the
surcharge.

"Our main concern is remaining competitive in the market," Woodward
said. "It's a very costly business to get involved in, very
time-consuming and capital intensive."

The energy department was expected to decide within a few weeks where
the uranium byproduct waste now at an abandoned plant in Fernald, Ohio,
will be sent for storage.

Last month, state officials approved a license amendment for Waste
Control Specialists that allows the company to expand its current
capacity of 250,000 cubic feet to 1.5 million cubic feet, enough waste
to fill more than seven railroad cars. The amendment made it possible
for the company to be eligible to accept the waste from Ohio.

The 10 percent fee would also apply to future commercial or government
waste the company takes in at the site 30 miles west of the town of
Andrews, near the New Mexico border.

Unlike a bill passed in 2003 that dealt with low-level radioactive
waste, Andrews County will not receive a portion of the percentage
proposed in the uranium byproduct bill. The bill passed in the last
session gave the county half of the state's 10 percent for low-level
radioactive waste.

Duncan's bill also proposes transferring all oversight of radioactive
waste from the Department of State Health Services to the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.

Woodward said the company is not opposed to the shift in agency
oversight as long as it doesn't delay license applications pending with
the state.

Friday was the final day legislators could file bills for consideration
this session.

Shrinking town in New Mexico pins hopes on uranium project

Associated Press

EUNICE, N.M. - Like many others in this former boomtown, Mayor James
Brown knows more about isotopes, centrifuges and uranium-235 than your
average college student.

Brown's recent crash course in nuclear physics was a prerequisite: Many
of his constituents are counting on the jobs and economic trickle-down
that are being promised if a $1.3 billion uranium enrichment plant that
would make fuel for nuclear power plants comes to town.

Critics say the proposed National Enrichment Facility could pollute the
environment, guzzle scarce water and leave this oil-producing town with
tons of radioactive waste and nowhere to put it.

But the mayor warns that without the plant, Eunice faces extinction.

"We have to have something else in place or communities like Eunice and
Jal will just disappear," he said. "The oil industry won't be able to
support our economy 20 or 30 years from now."

The project would be the first privately operated uranium enrichment
plant in the United States and the first U.S. installation to use
centrifuge technology, rather than a process known as gaseous diffusion
that has been around since the Manhattan Project.

Louisiana Energy Services, the international consortium behind the
plant, wanted to build the project in rural Louisiana, but backed out in
1998 after opponents accused it of targeting a predominantly poor and
black parish. Then it pulled out of Hartsville, Tenn., in 2003 after
running into opposition from former Vice President Al Gore and others.

The new proposed site is in the flat, scrub-covered desert 340 miles
from Albuquerque in the southeastern corner of the state, close to the
Texas line. LES has promised that the plant would employ 400 workers
during the construction phase and, once it is up and running, 210
people, with a payroll of more than $10 million and an average salary of
$50,000.

Last week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board held public meetings on the LES plan. At one, Lea County
Commissioner Darrold Stephenson made his point by flipping the lights
off.

If the project is turned down, "this is what we're passing on to our
future generations: nothing," the 70-year-old commissioner said later.

Oil and natural gas have been the region's lifeblood for decades. Today,
bobbing oil pumps and high-pressure gas lines are woven into Eunice's
modest street grid.

But many oil-related jobs are disappearing because of new labor-saving
technology, and companies have discovered more lucrative oil fields
elsewhere. Since 1985, Eunice's population has fallen by a third, to
2,500.

Townspeople in Eunice overwhelmingly support the project. Some have
grown tired of environmentalists and other out-of-towners preaching
doom, and many note that they have lived with industrial hazards all
their lives.

"Don't tell me how dangerous this is when I grew up in this oil field,"
said Fay Thompson, owner of The Bakery and More restaurant on Main
Street. Compared to working with oil, the plant is a "walk in the park,"
Thompson said.

Her husband, she said, died 40 years ago of cancer related to benzene, a
petroleum byproduct.

Still, a few in town are skeptical.

"We're such a gullible lot here, what can I say?" said Rose Gardner,
owner of Desert Rose Flowers and Gifts. "The whole world knows the
negative side, but Lea County doesn't seem to know it."

Nuclear disposal deal in works

Firm seeking permits to store waste in W. Texas agrees to state tax on revenues

10:18 PM CST on Friday, March 11, 2005

By RANDY LEE LOFTIS / The Dallas Morning News

For 10 years, Dallas billionaire Harold C. Simmons has tried to turn a
converted patch of West Texas scrubland into a tomb for Cold War nuclear
waste so hot it will need guarding for thousands of years.

A few legislators want to hit the brakes, saying Texas shouldn't agree
to take some of the government's most-radioactive leftovers Ð waste that
Ohio, Nevada and Utah already rejected Ð without so much as a public
hearing.

But a plan is in the works that might drown out those protests.

In agreeing to a new state radioactive-waste tax on its federal revenue,
Mr. Simmons' company would get some assurance that the Legislature won't
try to keep it from taking government nuclear waste from around the
country.

"It gives the state some incentive to continue the licensing process,"
said George M. Dials, president of Waste Control Specialists.

Some lobbyists see a potential conflict of interest: If the federal
waste becomes a huge revenue source, regulators might feel pressure to
approve the company's plans, in turn helping make Texas the nation's
main destination for the material.

"We're really concerned that they wouldn't put it through the same level
of scrutiny," said Cyrus Reed, a Sierra Club lobbyist.

The tax bill's author, Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, said the federal
waste would come, with or without a tax. State regulators already ruled
that Waste Control Specialists could store waste from one possible
federal job for two years. They're processing the company's request for
permanent disposal Ð a decision that would help it go after big-income
federal contracts.

"I have concerns about Texas Ð especially West Texas, where I live Ð
becoming the disposal site of first and last resort for the whole
country," Mr. Duncan said. "But the laws that are on the books already
permit that. This is just a matter of making sure that the state reaps
the benefits."

But a key environmental lobbyist said the state shouldn't start
welcoming waste that must be guarded for millennia without public
debate.

"We're about to see the ship of state buried under a maelstrom of
radioactive waste," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, Texas director of the
environmental and consumer group Public Citizen.

Another idea arose about the tax during the company's discussions with
Mr. Duncan: Because paying for Texas' cash-starved schools is the
Legislature's hottest button right now, why not earmark the
radioactive-waste tax money for education?

"It has been discussed," Mr. Dials said. "Hopefully, they would use this
for the education of our children."

Mr. Duncan said he wants the waste-tax income to go into general
revenue. But if tagging the money for schools became the deciding factor
in getting the tax passed, he would concur.

Waste Control Specialists lawyer Michael L. Woodward said the company
has agreed not to use its political clout to oppose the tax. However, he
said, there was no deal to use school funding or anything else in order
to undercut legislative opposition.

"It's just kind of a realization that we're going to have a tax," he
said.

Critics such as Mr. Smith of Public Citizen said even discussing a link
to school funding would be a bad idea, essentially turning teachers into
lobbyists for the importation of radioactive waste.

Waiting for payoff

The decadelong drive of the 73-year-old Mr. Simmons Ð chemicals and
metals mogul, Republican moneyman and shadow presence in the government
halls of Washington and Austin Ð to reach this point has not been easy
or cheap. He has spent millions on lobbyists and politicians' campaigns.
He's spent millions more on his small, as-yet unprofitable
waste-disposal company. Its reported losses total $25 million.

Any day now, that work could pay off. The deciding factors are pending
state licenses for disposal of radioactive waste and a federal contract
that could open the door for much bigger ones.

Within a week, a federal contractor will tell the U.S. Energy Department
who should get a job worth millions: disposing dangerous leftovers from
an old atomic-bomb materials plant in Fernald, Ohio.

Waste Control Specialists is among a few select bidders. There's no
winner yet; reviewing the choice will take about a month.

The company might lose; it lost a smaller contract to handle
less-radioactive federal waste last month.

But if it gets the nod, which seems increasingly likely, sometime this
year the first of 3,500 truckloads of uranium waste mixed with concrete
and encased in steel would leave Ohio for Andrews, Texas, west of
Midland. It would possibly truck along Interstate 20through Dallas-Fort
Worth, although no route is set.

Mr. Duncan's proposed tax Ð 10 percent of the company's gross receipts
from a number of kinds of radioactive waste, with a surcharge on the
most radioactive types Ð ultimately would yield millions for the state.
How much depends on whether the company gets the big contracts.

First contract of many?

The Fernald disposal contract is likely to be fairly small, in the range
of $20 million, based on projections of $2 million in state tax on the
company's receipts. The Fernald waste project, counting the planning,
transportation, disposal and the cleanup contractor's share, is just $50
million out of a $4.4 billion cleanup-and-closure effort.

But the Fernald contract is only one step toward potentially huge
income. The company also is seeking a state license to dispose of
low-level radioactive waste, such as contaminated clothing or tools,
mostly from commercial nuclear plants. It can treat and store it now but
must send it elsewhere for disposal.

The big money, Mr. Dials said, would come from future contracts for
federal radioactive waste from facilities such as the Savannah River
Plant and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Army also has cleanups
under way.

And with uranium's price going up, there's likely to be more mining in
the West, with disposal sites needed for the radioactive waste, called
tailings.

"We think we can meet that market need," said Mr. Dials, a trim,
white-haired West Point-MIT graduate and former Energy Department
project manager who wears his Vietnam Silver Star ribbon on his lapel.
"That's why we're willing to spend millions and millions of dollars to
get this license, because we have an ideal site for that type of
facility."

Possible nuclear zone

Another company, Louisiana Energy Services Ð formerly headed by Mr.
Dials Ð wants to build a factory for nuclear power plant fuel in New
Mexico, across the state line from Waste Control Specialists' West Texas
facility. It doesn't have a license yet, but depending on future
decisions by LES and federal agencies, waste from that plant could end
up in Texas, too.

Taken together, the projects would mean that Andrews County, Texas, and
Lea County, N.M., would become a nuclear zone of national importance Ð a
point that bothers some legislators.

"This isn't what we had in mind," said state Rep. Pete Gallego,
D-Alpine, who wants a joint committee to review Waste Control
Specialists' plans. But two weeks after he filed his resolution, it
hasn't advanced.

Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, filed a bill to block shipments
from anywhere but Texas, Vermont and Maine, the original partners in a
three-state compact. That bill is in committee.

Such moves could keep Waste Control Specialists from making good on its
decade of planning and politicking Ð unfairly so, the company says.

"All we are asking them to do is to fairly implement the regulations
that are already on the books," Mr. Dials said.

Locals behind plan

If anything blocks the company's plans, it won't be local opposition or
technical concerns about the site. Andrews County officials back the
plans, and the Fernald cleanup contractor's waste manager called the
site ideal.

"They are granted with about the perfect combination of climate and
geology of any site I've seen," said Dennis Carr, who works for
contractor Fluor Fernald. "They're over a 600-foot [deep] layer of this
red, dense clay that, combined with a climate that has less than about
10 inches of rainfall a year. ... It's just an amazing site."

Moving the waste to West Texas isn't a concern, even if it passes just
south of downtown Dallas and Fort Worth, said Richard Ratliff, head of
the state health department's radiation control bureau.

"I'd much rather be next to a truckload of this material at a red light
than next to a tanker of gasoline," he said.

But Mr. Smith of Public Citizen said anybody who's ever been in urban
interstate traffic, combining backups with fast, careless drivers,
should think twice about the chance of a radioactive crash.

"Rather than earmark this money for schools or general revenues, we
should put it into a fund to pay for the inevitable cleanup after an
accident," he said.

Competitors for the Fernald waste could include sites in South Carolina,
Tennessee, Washington state and Idaho. A federal facility in Nevada, the
Nevada Test Site, is also officially on the list, but that state says it
would sue to block it.

Leaving the waste in Ohio isn't an option. Technical concerns and Ohio
politicians saw to that.

Fluor Fernald also has a big incentive to ship the waste this year: It
gets a government bonus.

Texas has struggled with radioactive waste questions for more than 20
years. A state agency, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Authority,
was supposed to plan and run a waste facility.

The authority failed; El Paso blocked a site near that city, and in 1998
the state's environmental commissioners, appointed by then-Gov. George
Bush, rejected a site at Sierra Blanca, also in West Texas.

The next year, the Legislature abolished the authority and launched new
studies.

In 1995, another factor arose. Waste Control Specialists Ð founded by
Houston businessman Ken Bigham and Kent Hance, a congressman turned
lobbyist Ð tried but failed to get the Legislature to let a private
company operate the low-level facility.

Mr. Simmons' corporation, Valhi Inc., invested $25 million to get half
interest in Waste Control Specialists in 1995. Gradually, Valhi bought
nearly the whole company. Mr. Bigham left, but Mr. Hance stayed as part
owner and a management committee member; it was Mr. Hance who recruited
Mr. Dials, then an independent consultant, in September 2003 to the
company.

Valhi's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed as
early as 1995 how valuable contracts for Energy Department waste would
be. Eventually, the department began sending some waste for treatment
and temporary storage.

But what the company really wanted were disposal licenses.

Political contributions

Money helped fuel that effort. Since 2000, when Texas campaign finance
reports went online, Mr. Simmons, his family, his business executives
and associates and his lobbyists have given nearly $2.04 million to
Texas candidates.

They also have given nearly $2 million to federal candidates since 1995,
Federal Election Commission reports show. Neither figure includes
millions spent on lobbyists, political action committees and parties.

In 2003, the Legislature granted the company the change it had long
sought: opening low-level waste disposal to private companies. When the
state solicited license applications last year, Waste Control
Specialists was the only applicant.

Mr. Woodward, the company lawyer, said money didn't make the difference,
based on the years it took to get the state's go-ahead. "This type of
facility does not get its license without extensive scrutiny by the
regulators," he said.

Mr. Ratliff, the health department regulator, said rules, not politics,
have driven the state's reviews. Susan Jablonski, a Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality official handling the low-level disposal license
review, said regulators have the power to reject Waste Control
Specialists' bid. "The rules are clear," she added.

Mr. Smith of Public Citizen sees it differently.

"It's the same old game," he said: "Only organized people can defeat
organized money."

E-mail rloftis@dallasnews.com FROM AFRICA TO OHIO, ON TO TEXAS?

How the Fernald radioactive waste came about is a lesson in World War II
and Cold War history.

From 1951 to 1989, the U.S. Energy Department plant in Fernald, Ohio,
processed the world's richest uranium ore into fuel for reactors that
made plutonium for atomic bombs.

The ore came from the same mine in the Belgian Congo, now Zaire, that
produced the uranium Ð spirited out of Africa to keep it out of Nazi
hands Ð used in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

Because the Congo ore was so much higher in uranium content than ores
from the western United States Ð about 45 percent, compared to less than
1 percent from most American ore Ð it took much less to get the same
amount of pure uranium.

Fernald produced 500 million pounds of pure uranium, leaving about 8,900
cubic yards of waste Ð a fraction of the waste that extracting the same
amount of uranium from low-grade American ores would have produced.

But the higher uranium content also meant that pound for pound, the
Fernald waste had much more of uranium's radioactive "daughter
products," such as radium and thorium that are produced when uranium
decays.

That's why the Fernald waste will be chemically stabilized, mixed with
40,000 cubic yards of concrete, then put inside steel containers for the
trip to West Texas Ð or to whatever site wins the contract.

Once disposed of, it must be managed "basically forever," said Fluor
Fernald spokesman Jeff Wagner.

Yucca scandal shows lunacy

It's one thing to cook the books for personal financial gain. It's quite
another when data that can have an effect on thousands of human lives is
purposely misleading.

The Justice Department has its bloodhounds sniffing around suspicious
reports prepared by U.S. Geological Survey employees doing the footwork
for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump - where the government wants
to hollow out a mountain about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, then
fill it up with nuclear trash from reactors and other sites across the
country.

The lunacy level is high when somebody actually considers boxing up and
transporting radioactive materials all the way across the country. The
logistics, security and safety aspects send shivers of fear down the
spines of most humans capable of the thought process. That would
exclude, of course, a great number of the members of the U.S. Congress
and White House administration toadies who have dug their heels in on
this one and insist on plunging forward, no matter how high the risk or
what objective scientists and the public thinks.

Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, of Nevada, went into a rage over
the supposedly false reports, saying the "Department of Energy must
cheat and lie to make Yucca Mountain look safe" and that this is really
"about the health and safety of Nevadans and the American people."

He has put together a bill that would force the producers of nuclear
waste to store it at their facilities. Unless he can come up with the
goods in the next three years, however, all he's doing is chipping away
at Mt. Everest with an ice pick because President Bush and like-minded
hawks have their talons sharpened with Nevada as their target. These
guys are bent on not only using the state as a dumping ground, but in
re-opening the Nevada Test Site, where more than 1,000 nukes were
exploded between 1951 and 1992.

Their ducks are in a row politically and psychologically with a
GOP-controlled Congress and a propaganda machine that keeps turning out
warnings about nuclear threats from North Korea, Iran or whoever else
might not be toeing the Bush line.

Never mind that this lethal garbage will roll down our highways and
railways, past our homes and be deposited in a hole in the ground not
far from one of the nation's fastest-growing communities. Never mind
that we've already killed as many as 15,000 Americans exposed to
radioactive fallout.

And never mind that the whole case for this thing, we are now learning,
is probably built on a stack of lies.

Reid's latest bill is dead wrong. Instead, he should write one
suggesting that this nuclear waste should be dumped at a little ranch
near Crawford, Texas, where the landlord can be responsible for taking
care of his own trash.

After all, it's his mess.

Local high-tech company may expand: Possible sites include Pocatello airport

By John O'Connell - Journal writer
Wittrock
 
 
 POCATELLO - A high-tech Chubbuck manufacturer, Premier Technology, may
 build a $7 million factory that would anchor a long-planned industrial
 park at the Pocatello Regional Airport.

 If local officials can assemble a desirable economic incentives package
 soon, Premier could start construction on a roughly 100,000-square-foot
 facility within a few months, according to Arlen Wittrock, director of
 public affairs and communication.



 If all goes well, Wittrock said Premier could open the plant, which
 would roughly double the size of the building at its current location
 at 170 E. Siphon Road, by the first quarter of next year.

 However, Wittrock said Premier is also considering three other
 locations in Pocatello, a Blackfoot location and locations in Texas or
 Nebraska.

 Premier builds equipment used in the nuclear industry, such as
 protective isolation barriers, glove boxes, shielding windows and
 environmental storage containers for waste handling. The business has
 grown from $5 million in sales in 1997 to 178 employees and $30 million
 in annual sales currently.

 Premier has already outgrown its building and currently leases space in
 Blackfoot and Pocatello's old Naval Ordinance Plant, in addition to
 running field support offices in Caldwell and Twin Falls.

 The extra manufacturing space in a single location would enable Premier
 to add at least 125 new high-paid employees to its staff by 2010,
 Wittrock said.

 "This is a homegrown business, and the vast majority of the 178
 employees live here and would want to continue to live here," Wittrock
 said. "No. 1 on the list at this point in time is at the airport, and
 the city wants very much to develop an industrial park at the airport."

 However, Wittrock said high property taxes are a concern about building
 in Pocatello.

 Other possible Pocatello locations include property near the Bannock
 County Fairgrounds and near Century High School.

 If Premier opts to build at the airport, Wittrock believes it would
 attract other businesses to the industrial park. He said the airport is
 an attractive location for Premier because it is flat and located close
 to Interstate 86.

 "I believe if Premier Technology were to build at the airport, it would
 be a great stimulus to development of the project," Wittrock said.
 "Someone needs to go first."

 The factory would create more high-paying jobs with benefits than a
 coal-gasification power plant proposed at the former FMC site, although
 it would generate substantially less construction value and property
 taxes than the plant.

 The airport belongs to Pocatello but is located within Power County -
 hence Bannock County would not receive a share of property taxes
 generated from the building.

 Harry Neuhardt, chairman of Pocatello Development Authority, which
 administers the city's tax increment financing districts, said TIF
 benefits are under consideration to entice Premier to build at the
 airport.

 In a TIF district, property owners continue paying property taxes to
 taxing bodies at rates before improvements are made. The difference in
 the assessed value after the land is developed is diverted and used to
 finance building infrastructure within the borders of the TIF district.

 "We would very much like to see if we can put together a package and
 see if we can get them to locate here at the airport," Neuhardt said.
 "We think this would be a good start."

 Neuhardt, who also serves as a city councilman, said Pocatello is close
 to signing a deal with Hooper Knowlton, of the Knowlton Group and
 Realty Co. in Salt Lake City, to be the city's exclusive agent for
 airport development. Knowlton's group proposed to build infrastructure
 and lure businesses to the airport in exchange for a percentage of
 lease payments from new companies.

 Several proposals have been made for development at the airport, but
 Neuhardt said they all fell through "for one reason or another."

 Wittrock said state Rep. Elmer Martinez, D-Pocatello, has also been
 instrumental in efforts to create a desirable incentives package.

 Martinez helped draft legislation to extend proposed business
 incentives designed to benefit large companies in the Boise area to
 smaller businesses in other communities.

 "If we're trying to do an economic incentive thing for a large company
 like Albertsons we should try to do some type of job incentive for
 startup companies in smaller communities all across the state,"
 Martinez said. "One of the maxims is to protect what you have.

 "Premier is exactly the type of company we want to keep in our area. If
 we we're able to get them there, I think other companies would see the
 potential benefits of locating around them."

Plant considering expanding in Pocatello -- if sweet enough deal
Originally published Thursday, March 24, 2005
POCATELLO (AP) -- A Pocatello manufacturing company that produces
materials used in nuclear waste handling is looking to expand.

Premier Technology may build a $7 million, 100,000-square-foot factory
in Pocatello -- if the city offers a desirable economic package, said
Arlen Wittrock, director of public affairs and communication. He said
the new facility would about double the size of what the company has
now.

But he said the company is also considering locations in Blackfoot,
Texas or Nebraska.

Premier's products include protective isolation barriers, shielding
windows and environmental storage containers for nuclear waste. Its
annual sales have grown from $5 million in 1997 to $30 million.

The company is considering building in the long-planned industrial park
at the Pocatello Regional Airport, but Wittrock said the company is
concerned about high property taxes.

State Rep. Elmer Martinez, D-Pocatello, has been helping the city
develop incentive packages to offer the company.

"If we're trying to do an economic incentive thing for a large company
like Albertsons, we should try to do some type of job incentive for
startup companies in smaller communities all across the sate," Martinez
said. "One of the maxims is to protect what you have."

Wittrock said if the new plant were built, the company would add about
125 high-paid employees to its staff by 2010 -- more than the proposed
coal gasification power plant at the former FMC site. However, it would
generate less construction revenue and property taxes than the coal
plant.

Premier's proposed airport site is in Power County, so Bannock County
would not get a share of the property taxes from the building.

Nuclear materials in unsafe packages

By Betsy Mason

CONTRA COSTA TIMES

Lawrence Livermore Lab has been storing plutonium in potentially unsafe
containers such as paint cans and food pack cans, according to a report
this week by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.

The board is urging Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman to improve
packaging and storage of nuclear materials at Livermore and other
Department of Energy sites following a recent review of nuclear
materials.

The recommendation, sent to the DOE March 10, notes some plutonium at
Livermore is stored in "thin-walled tinned carbon steel containers used
in the food industry" with no modifications for nuclear materials --
paint cans with press-fit lids and cans with slip lids that are often
kept closed with tape.

These containers are not designed to deal with pressure that builds up
over time from gases released by the nuclear substances, corrosion or
common chemical reactions, or to withstand being dropped, according to
the report.

"I am surprised to find that this kind of unsafe storage is still going
on," said Marylia Kelley, executive director of Tri-Valley Communities
Against a Radioactive Environment, a Livermore-based nuclear watchdog
group.

In 1994, the safety board found excess and waste nuclear material was
being stored unsafely. The DOE responded by repackaging all the nuclear
material that isn't being used and can be put away in safe, airtight,
durable containers. But the 1994 recommendation didn't deal with
short-term storage of plutonium and uranium, which need to be readily
accessed for use at the lab for weapons research.

A call for comment from the DOE's National Nuclear Security
Administration was not returned Thursday afternoon.

There are some specific requirements for certain types of uranium, but,
otherwise, "there is no explicit DOE-wide requirement to ensure the safe
storage of nuclear materials," according to the board's report.

The bulk of the plutonium in the DOE complex that is actively used is
kept at Livermore and Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, although some
plutonium and uranium also is used at the Savannah River site in South
Carolina, Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, the Pantex plant in
Amarillo, Texas, and the Hanford site in Washington state.

In 2003, several workers were exposed to plutonium at Los Alamos because
of a degraded storage container. Although no exposures have been
reported at Livermore because of bad packaging, in 2004 a package
containing a form of plutonium was accidentally dropped.

The safety board is an independent oversight committee within the
executive branch that was established by Congress in the late 1980s to
give recommendations to the Secretary of Energy on health and safety
issues. The board has no regulatory power, but the DOE generally accepts
its recommendations and is required to act on them.

The new recommendation comes on the heels of another board report issued
in January that found problems with the ventilation system and glove
boxes used to handle plutonium without exposure at Livermore Lab's
"superblock" plutonium facility. That prompted a voluntary standdown of
plutonium work at the facility, later that month, which is still in
effect.

"I really want to applaud the DNFSB for this action they are taking,"
said Kelley. "We want DNFSB to recommend that the plutonium facility
remain closed until these problems are actually addressed."

2 Fernald silos to be razed
Waste in holding tanks, but destination unclear

By Dan Klepal
Enquirer staff writer

The earthen berm, which shored up the Fernald silo walls, has been 
removed as cleanup continues.
The Enquirer/Michael E. Keating
Zoom

CROSBY TWP. - Two of the most visible symbols of the environmental and
human health threats posed by the Cold War-era Fernald uranium plant
will soon be reduced to rubble.

But that doesn't mean the threat is gone.

The government contractors in charge of the $4.4 billion environmental
cleanup at the 1,000-acre site have emptied two concrete silos that have
held the most dangerous nuclear waste at the plant since the early
1950s. They've moved that waste - a sandy, radioactive byproduct left
behind after raw ore was stripped of most of its uranium in a variety of
acid baths - into four metal holding tanks so crews can begin digging
out the silos and cutting them down with shears in the next few weeks.

Already most of the dirt that enveloped the sides of the silos,
protecting against tornados since the mid-1960s, has been carved away.
Those two silos should be razed in about five weeks. A third silo, which
holds a less-radioactive powdery material, won't be torn down until the
fall.

Even though the sandy waste is still at Fernald, citizens say razing the
silos is a huge step - both in terms of physically being one step closer
to finishing the cleanup, and psychologically making the community feel
safer.

"The tearing down of the silos is monumental," said Jim Bierer, chairman
of the Fernald Citizen's Advisory Committee.

The committee has monitored the cleanup from the beginning. "It proves
to the community that the Department of Energy is cleaning up the site,
and that there's a clear path ahead.

"We're feeling so much more comfortable about the whole thing, the
technology has been working, the material is out of silos, and the silos
are now being torn down. It just takes a weight off your shoulders."

That weight won't be completely lifted, however, until the Department of
Energy finds a final resting place for the material, now held in four
750,000-gallon temporary holding tanks. The tanks are housed in a
reinforced concrete building near the silos.

DOE officials are negotiating with a company in Andrews, Texas, to store
the waste there for about two years while it seeks a permit to
permanently bury the material there.

That company, Waste Control Specialists, predicts the Texas Board of
Health will decide by October on permanently storing the waste.

Dennis Carr, project manager for the silos, said despite harsh criticism
over safety procedures at the silos - from the Nuclear Defense
Facilities Safety Board and local citizens - there have been no
accidents, no exposures to radiation and no injuries on the $400 million
project.

Carr also said many of the people working on the silos project have
worked at Fernald since the 1980s, when the plant was still producing
uranium.

"We've been on this site an average of more than 20 years," he said. "To
all of us, this is the representation that the project is near over.
There's a real sense of accomplishment because we knew this would be the
hardest job since Day 1."

There's still a lot of work to do.

The waste still has to be mixed with cement and fly ash, placed in huge
concrete shipping crates and trucked away. That last part is most
important to Lisa Crawford, a member of the citizens' committee and a
long-time observer and critic of the cleanup.

"The bottom line is once it leaves here it can't come back" under rules
that govern the cleanup, Crawford said. "It's good that the silos are
coming down and the waste is out of (two) of them, because their
integrity has been questioned for years. But my fear is that this stuff
is now going to stay in the temporary tanks for 50 years, like they
stayed in the silos for 50 years."

If officials in Texas reject the waste, it will leave the federal
government with only one option - the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas.
That option is less than appealing because state officials there have
threatened a lawsuit to stop the shipments and keep the Fernald waste
out of the desert.

While Department of Justice lawyers say disposal of the material in
Nevada is legal, a battle over the issue would make it impossible for
the contractor to finish its work by the June 2006 deadline.

Citizens and crews working on the silos have become accustomed to
setbacks.

Two previous attempts to clean up the silos were abandoned - after
spending more than $69 million in taxpayer money - because they were
deemed not technically feasible or because the contractor gave up before
finishing the work. Those failures led to the current plan of encasing
the waste in concrete.

A previous plan envisioned turning the waste into glass.

"The community has always seen the silos waste as the worst thing on the
site," Crawford said. "This stuff has to go."

Editorial: Radioactive waste dump needs study
Publish Date: March 31, 2005  |  Permanent Link
   
    State Rep. Pete Gallego has stepped up to the plate again, trying to
    get the House and Senate to form a joint interim committee to study
    the risks of importing radioactive waste into Andrews County.

    Gallego believes a joint committee is a needed step to throw more
    light on the nuclear waste issue and to ensure Texas doesn't become
    the nation's dumping ground for radioactive waste.

    His resolution has been referred to committee, and Ð with some luck
    Ð a joint committee could be established to conduct hearings
    sometime this summer.

    Two years ago when the Legislature passed HB 1567, lawmakers were
    told the primary purpose was to guarantee a location where low-level
    radioactive waste from Texas sources could be deposited. Since then,
    the Central Compact States (which include Nebraska, Louisiana,
    Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas) have expressed interest in bringing
    low-level radioactive waste into West Texas.

    Gallego wants the interim joint committee to take public testimony
    and to offer recommendations to the governor and Legislature before
    the next regular session.

    "I want a cost/benefit analysis," Gallego said. "I want to know what
    all the costs are before other lawmakers decide to turn West Texas
    into the nation's first and last resort for radioactive waste
    disposal."

    Gallego's call should be heeded by our lawmakers.

    A public airing of the issue is needed before we go even farther
    down a dangerous road fraught with economic and environmental
    consequences.

 Andrews nuclear waste dump wins praise, draws questions at Thursday hearing

ANDREWS -- In about 18 months if a nuclear waste repository 30 miles
west of here clears all governmental hurdles, it'll be fully licensed by
the state of Texas and start taking low-level radioactive waste from
around the nation, 200 people were told at a public hearing Thursday
night.

"This is not something that just happened on the spur of the moment,"
said Mayor Robert Zap, explaining he and other officials have asked hard
questions to repository owner Waste Control Specialists of Dallas.

State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, told the crowd at Andrews High
School that he became familiar with radioactive facilities during his
eight years as mayor of Amarillo, where the Pantex nuclear warhead
assembly plant operates.

Seliger said he will support the respository as long as the people of
Andrews want it and said they should keep reiterating that support to
him.

Saying he's lived in Andrews County since 1934, John Post asked WCS Vice
President for Licensing Dean Kunihiro what the company will do with the
700 boxcars, or 1.5 million cubic yards, of Ohio waste it has already
started burying at the site if the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality denies its license application.

Kunihiro said the materials would be transported to the Atomic Energy
Commission's Nevada Test Site, but Post said the attorney general of
Nevada has filed a lawsuit to prevent the storing of any more waste
there. Kunihiro said the materials could be put there in spite of that
state's objection.

He said the Ohio waste is only cleared for storage here until October
2007, and it will have to be removed if WCS doesn't have a TCEQ license
by then.

Kunihiro said the state of Texas will assume ownership of the repository
site when it is completely filled and covered with reinforced concrete,
adding that standing atop 800 feet of thick clay will keep it from
polluting the Trujillo Formation below. He said the site is not above
the huge Ogallala Aquifer, which supplies underground water from the
Texas High Plains north of Amarillo to the Permian Basin.

TCEQ health physicist Susan Jablonski told Post the Ohio waste is being
accepted here on the basis of a license granted by the Texas Department
of State Health Services.

Rose Gardner of Eunice, N.M., five miles west of the WCS site,
challenged Kunihiro's assertion that it "is remote" because it's right
down Highway 176 from where she lives. The WCS executive said that from
the perspective of someone who lives in a big city, it is indeed remote.

Austin attorney Kent Hance, a former Lubbock congressman who has worked
as a lobbyist for billionaire WCS owner Harold Simmons for 15 years,
said scientific analysis has proved the site safe. "If the science says
we can do it, we should do it," said Hance.

Jablonski said the TCEQ just completed its administrative review of the
project and will do a "merit review" between now and May, after which a
15-month technical review will consider the soundness of the design and
other safety factors.

Does US military 'recognize' its own regulations on DU?

Does US military 'recognize' its own regulations on DU?
Will it now comply with environmental and health care mandates for both US and Iraq?


Retired Major Doug Rokke, Ph.D. (USAR, retired), who was an Army health
physicist during the Gulf war and was then responsible for trying to
'clean up' radiologically contaminated US equipment (RCE's) there, has
been calling on the military to follow its own regulations <
http://www.traprockpeace.org/rokke_du_3_ques.html >.

He and Damacio Lopez continue to make this call <
http://www.traprockpeace.org/doug_rokke_damacio_lopez.html >.

These Army regulations and the "Handling Procedures for Equipment
Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities" <
http://traprockpeace.org/du_pam_700-48.pdf > specify stringent
requirements for handling RCE's, as well as providing medical
surveillance, training, and environmental protection among other
requirements.

[You may also download the Procedures at the military's site:
http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/p700_48.pdf ]. For instance, the
regulations require protecting the environment in the war zone - Iraq in
this case - (Army Regulation 700-48, 2-4) and medical care for any
"individual" who "may have been exposed" to DU contamination. (Army
Regulation 700-48, 2-5). (The US has used DU in many US states and other
countries; we focus on Iraq here, given the current crisis and the huge
amounts of DU used. The regulations apply wherever DU has been used.)

Reading these regulations and procedures, one must wonder how the US can
justify - morally or legally - using such a weapon. (See the Karen
Parker, J.D., article on the illegality of DU Weaponry under
international humanitarian law:
http://traprockpeace.org/karen_parker_du_illegality.pdf )

Very recently, two US military publications have taken noticee of the
regulations. But again, what of the Iraqis - a people who will be left
to live with what the US has left behind? And, will the military follow
these reminders of their regulations, even concerning US soldiers?

The Nov-Dec, 2004 issue of the US military's Hazardous Technical
Information Services Bulletin, VOL. 14 NO. 6; pages 7-8, references
requirements for the "Management and Handling of Equipment Contaminated
With Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities." You may download the
entire Bulletin here < http://www.traprockpeace.org/c0501.pdf >

download option because sometimes government documents disappear, and
because some people do not like to pick up cookies at military
websites.)

Dr. Abdul H. Khalid, Chemical Engineer, HTIS, writes:

The U.S. Department of Army (DA) Regulation (AR 700-48) outlines formal
policy and procedures for the management of equipment contaminated with
depleted uranium (DU) or radioactive commodities. This publication is
available online at: http://traprockpeace.org/du_pam_700-48.pdf

The DA Pamphlet (PAM 700-48) recommends handling procedures for
equipment contaminated with depleted uranium (DU) and/or other low-level
wastes (LLRW). PAM 700-48 applies to DA commands, installations, and
activities. The current revision updated symbols, removed obsolete
publications, and added technical references. This publication is
available at http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/p700_48.pdf

These documents are of great help to generators of excess radioactive
materials who wish to collect and consolidate these materials in
preparation for removals off-post.

He goes on to give contact information for Radioactive Waste Disposal
Offices in order to receive "guidance on radioactive waste materials,
their proper disposal procedures, and technical information on LLRW."
See the Bulletin, pages 7-8, for the complete article:
http://www.traprockpeace.org/nov-dec04.pdf

We note, though, that a regulation more than just "outlines formal
policy and procedures..." Federal regulations are federal law. The
regulation states "By order of the Secretary of the Army...[t]regulatin
prescribes policy and procedures for the management of equipment
contaminated with Depleted Uranium or radioactive commodities."
(emphasis added)

In January, 2005, the Central Region Review - U.S. Army Environmental
Center, Central Regional Office, Kansas City, MO January, 2005 - Regions
6 & 7 picks up this thread. See the section Federal Actions - Other
Regulatory Activity and General Information, page 27. (The regulation is
not exactly highlighted as it was put on page 27, but it's there
nonetheless). Download it here < http://www.traprockpeace.org/c0501.pdf
> or at the government site - http://aec.army.mil/usaec/reo/c0501.pdf

The January note validates Mr. Khalid's article, as well as what Doug
Rokke has been saying for years, to a point. I say "to a point" because
it also understates the force of the regulations, turning law into mere
policy. The January note reads:

Handling Procedures for Equipment Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or
Radioactive Commodities (DA PAM 70048) and Management of Equipment
Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities (AR
700-48). Department of the Army pamphlet PAM 700-48 provides recommended
handling procedures for equipment contaminated with depleted uranium and
other low-level radioactive materials or wastes. Army Regulation, AR
700-48, outlines formal procedures and policies for the management of
handling contaminated equipment. These documents can be accessed at
http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/p700_48.pdf

(757) 887-4692.

[Please note: I did not add a link to the Traprock website in either of
the above two military documents. They did indeed cite Traprock for a
copy of the military's own regulations. We're flattered but surprised to
be an offical source of federal law.]

Finally, someone in the military has taken note of the military's own
regulations. Thank you Dr. Khalid. Still, the force of the mandate has
been understated. Even if the military were encouraged to act concerning
US soldiers posts, and what about the mess that the US (and the UK, to a
lesser degree) have left in Iraq? The land and air are contamined by
radioactive dust and debris from hundreds of tons of uranium muntions
that have been used in Iraq since the first Gulf War.

We don't know how much DU was used in the current war. Estimates range
from the military's figures of 100 plus tons, to about 2000 tons if DU
was used in bunker busters. The US is not helping much to get to the
bottom of this, as it has refused (unlike the UK) to divulge where it
has used DU in Gulf War II. Even accepting US figures, about 450-500
tons would be a convervative estimate of the amount used since the first
Gulf War. (I suspect it is much higher:
http://traprockpeace.org/bunker_busters_kilpatrick.html .) Additionally,
hundreds of Iraqi vehicles have been left behind, in violation of Army
regulations.

Army Regulation 700-48, Section 2-4 (my emphasis added)

c. Handling. (1) The unit/team/individual responsible for the equipment,
whether friendly or foreign, at the time of damage or contamination is
responsible for taking all action consistent with this regulation and DA
PAM 700-48. ... (6) All equipment, to include captured or combat RCE,
will be surveyed, packaged, retrograded, decontaminated and released IAW
Technical Bulletin 9-1300-278, DA PAM 700-48 and other relevant
guidance.

Further, the dumping (abandonment) of much of this equipment in open air
'grave yards' violates 700-48, 2-4:

e. Disposal. (1) In general, environmental impact must be considered
prior to equipment retrograde. Retrograde operations must minimize the
spread of contamination preventing further harm to personnel and damage
to equipment. (2) Radioactive material and waste will not be locally
disposed of through burial, submersion, incineration, destruction in
place, or abandonment without approval from overall MACOM commander. If
local disposal is approved, the responsible MACOM commander must
document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact
location of the disposal. As soon as possible the MACOM commander must
forward all corresponding documentation to the Chief, Health Physicist,
AMCSF-P, HQAMC. (emphasis added)

US HAS ADMITTED HEALTH RISKS

We, in the anti-Du activist community, hear from US military apologists
all the time that there is no evidence of adverse health effects.
They're spinning rubbish. Without citing all of the scientific evidence
here (that's a whole book - see the proceedings of the World Uranium
Weapons Conference:
http://traprockpeace.org/depleted_uranium_hamburg03.html
http://traprockpeace.org/depleted_uranium_hamburg03.html), the
military's own documents condemn their argument. For example,

*Occasionally, a US government memo becomes public - such as the Los
Alamos memo (where proponency - lying - is the order of the day), or the
Defense Nuclear Agency memo that admits to DU's threat to health -
http://traprockpeace.org/twomemos.html

*Or, a military figure says some truth about DU in a non-public setting,
such as a presentation to manufacturers
http://traprockpeace.org/wakayama2.pdf

*Or a Pentagon scientist, such as Dr. Alexandra Miller, reports some
uncomfortable research (about chromosomal damage and bystander effects)
as she did at MIT. Her presentation on the DU health panel at MIT, with
Dr. Thomas Fasy, is available at
http://traprockpeace.org/mit_health.html

*And sometimes GI's talk about the horror of fiendish DU fire - as
happened after A-10's attacked Marines at An Nasiriyah with 30 mm DU
rounds - http://traprockpeace.org/du_friendly_fire.html

Here's a quote from a Marine field historian who heard these
testimonies:

"It's bad enough to be shot, but to be shot with a depleted uranium
round that basically turns you into a hand full of mush." - Col. Reed
Bonadonna, field historian, talking to NPR's Jackie Northam

*And, sometimes, a freedom of information act request turns up an
astonishing admission of 14 years of knowledge of DU's hazard to health:
http://traprockpeace.org/depleted_uranium_milner.html




The Department of Defense is a huge organization. It can't control all
information, and occasionally some truth gets out. It's up to us to act
on that truth.

ACT

Call your elected officials and tell them (they work for you) to take
action to abolish uranium weapons. And please call your favorite meda
and ask that they cover the issue. Some media have given excellent
coverage (RNNTV in metro NYC; WAMC in Albany; the Christian Science
Monitor; Vanity Fair; King TV5 in Washington State; and the Seattle
Intelligencier to name a few. But where are NPR, the New York Times and
the Washington Post? Has your local media covered DU?

If media, a Congressional aide, or your organization is looking for an
expert on DU, please call us - we'd be happy to offer suggestions.

Exxon Mobil to appeal ruling

Associated Press

IRVING, Texas - Exxon Mobil Corp. said Friday it plans to appeal a
ruling from a Louisiana court which it says did not go far enough in
reducing a $1 billion judgment against the oil company in an
environmental-damages case.

The appeals court reduced punitive damages from $1 billion to $112
million and left unchanged the jury's award of $56 million in
compensatory damages.

Exxon Mobil's general counsel, Charles Matthews, said the company acted
responsibly in the case and shouldn't pay any punitive damages. He also
said the jury called for a cleanup that goes beyond the requirements of
Louisiana regulations.

The case would be appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court.

In 2001, a jury in Orleans Parish, La., awarded the verdict to the
family of retired Jefferson Parish Judge Joseph Grefer. The family
claimed that Exxon's offshore pipe-cleaning operation contaminated its
property with radioactive waste.

A lawyer for the family said Exxon knew about radiation on drilling
pipes as early as 1981 but didn't tell local residents and workers.

In reducing the jury award, a three-judge panel of the state's 4th
Circuit Court of Appeal hinted that jurors may have been influenced by
Exxon's wealth - it earned a record $25.33 billion last year.

The court said the $1 billion punitive award was unreasonable and out of
proportion to the harm suffered by the Grefer family. However, the
judges criticized Exxon Mobil, saying the oil company knew that its
oil-drilling pipes posed a threat to the people who cleaned them.

The Grefers filed the lawsuit in 1997 against Exxon and Intracostal
Tubular Services, the company that leased the family land and cleaned
oil-field pipes for Exxon.

Exxon said the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality had found
that the radiation on the site was caused by naturally occurring
material and didn't threaten human health or the environment. The
company said less than 1 percent of the land was contaminated above
regulatory limits.

The company said it had offered to clean the property before the case
went to trial.

The chief lobbyist for Waste Control Specialists' radioactive waste
repository and a Sierra Club spokesman clashed Thursday on how "hot" the
materials are that the company wants to bury west of Andrews.

Kent Hance of Austin said the 6 million cubic yards of Texas-generated
waste for which WCS is asking a permit is all "Class A" low level
material like dirt, gloves, wrenches and medical equipment used in
nuclear power plants and hospitals.

He said the 600,000 cubic yards of mostly higher level "B" and "C" waste
the plant also seeks a license for is still classified as low level like
1.3 million cubic yards of material WCS wants to accept on 800 boxcars
from a repository being closed at Fernald, Ohio. "We can't take any high
level waste like fuel rods from U.S. Department of Energy nuclear
reactors," Hance said.

"We don't and can't take that. If we have a liquid hazardous waste, we
solidify it as ash or make it into a concrete block. If we take the
waste from Fernald, we will dig new pits. We'll have liners and cover
them with clay topsoil and plant grass."

A staff attorney in Hance's office, native Odessan Mike Woodward, said
the WCS plant would store low level waste from DOE facilities at Los
Alamos, N.M.; Rocky Flat, Colo. (near Denver); Idaho and other places
with materials from hospitals and other facilities under the
Texas-Vermont "Compact" agreement.

"The Ohio material may have some hot spots in it, but on the whole after
it's processed, the level will be no greater than Class A uranium mill
tailings," said Woodward. "All high level waste is taken to the DOE's
Yucca Mountain facility 80 miles north of Las Vegas, Nev."

Sierra Club spokesman Ken Kramer of Austin said Thursday what Hance and
Woodward said "is probably true in the sense the DOE classifies
everything low level except spent fuel rods.

"It's a common misconception when you try to differentiate, but that
doesn't mean it really is low level," said Kramer. "Cesium-137 is
classified low level, but it can give a lethal dose of radiation to a
person 3 feet away in 18 minutes. Much of the low level waste, as the
term is used, is actually very dangerous."

Kramer said the environmentally oriented Sierra Club is alarmed that WCS
proposes to bury more waste from more sources than it indicated when the
Texas Legislature passed enabling legislation two years ago.

"The original idea was just to take care of waste in Texas, partnering
with one or two small states," he said. "Now they're pursuing so many
avenues, they're basically trying to get everything but the kitchen sink
out there.

"They're trying to take large volumes of waste from the DOE, so
potentially we could be a state dumping ground for radioactive waste
from a good part of the nation."

ANDREWS -- The presence of two saltwater aquifers under a Waste Control
Specialists nuclear repository is no cause for alarm because they're
overlain by 600 to 800 feet of virtually impermeable red clay, WCS
spokesmen said Wednesday.

They said the Trujillo Formation is 600 feet below the site 30 miles
west of Andrews and the Santa Rosa Formation is 1,100 feet down. Both
run along the Texas-New Mexico border from North Ector County to the
Panhandle and Palo Duro Canyon, where the strata are visible in the
canyon walls.

Named for Trujillo Creek near Vega in Oldham County, the aquifer was
tapped by the WCS plant for dust suppression and industrial uses.
Drinking water is piped in from Eunice, N.M.

"We're relying almost solely on the retention capacities of that clay,"
said WCS Licensing Vice President Dean Kunihiro of Dallas, who spoke at
a public hearing last week at Andrews High School. The hearing was held
by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which is considering
WCS's license application.

The company wants to store 6 million cubic yards of low-level
radioactive materials and 600,000 cubic yards of high-level "hot" waste.

"The radioactive levels may be high, but conditions remain the same,"
Kunihiro said. "The stuff isn't going anywhere. The notion of leaking is
almost hokey."

Kunihiro is a former California state liaison for the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission at San Francisco.

"People get irrational, quite frankly," he said. "Credit goes to the
people in Andrews who have researched it themselves and don't get caught
up all the hysteria."

John Post, one of five Andrews citizens who spoke against the project
last week, said having aquifers under the site is worrisome.

"I think an earthquake might cause fissures in that redbed and it could
create a path for that radiation to reach the water," Post said
Wednesday. "There have been several earthquakes in the vicinity in the
not-too-distant past. I think they've selected a very poor site with the
underlying formations of water and the possibility of polluting them.
It's very shortsighted for a little short-term prosperity to blind us to
the fact we could be poisoning the water for future generations."

With their remarks taken down by a court reporter, 35 people spoke at
the hearing in favor of the plan.

Post referred to a 1999 report written by hydrogeologist Alan Dutton of
the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology in Austin.

"He disagrees with the WCS geologists about the suitability of that site
for the disposal of radioactive waste," Post said.

Questioning the age and formative process of the "redbed ridge," Dutton
said it might not be as effective a buffer between nuclear waste and
underground water as WCS claims. Texas Tech geologists in Lubbock
dispute Dutton's conclusions.

The site's construction supervisor is Cook-Joyce Engineering and its
geological consultant is the Intera Corp., both of Austin. Intera
geologist Gerald Grisak Wednesday said the Trujillo and Santa Rosa
formations underlie this part of the Permian Basin and Lea County, N.M.,
reaching Oklahoma through the western and central Panhandle.

"The water is generally brackish with high dissolved contents that make
it unpotable," Grisak said, meaning people can't drink it.

TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson of Austin said WCS's application will be
ruled on in about 15 months.

"A lot of the rules were dictated by the state Legislature, and there
are some pretty specific rules to follow," Clawson said. "There has been
interest, but we have really good people involved in this program. We're
just pushing ahead."

New alloy may help in rad waste disposal

BETHLEHEM, Pa., April 6 (UPI) -- A new alloy, able to absorb
radioactivity better than any other, may help dispose of spent nuclear
fuel, U.S. researchers said.

The United States currently has some 50,000 tons of spent nuclear-energy
fuel stored at 125 sites in 39 states. Many of the containers are made
with boron-laced stainless steel, which absorbs radiation. Even borated
stainless steel cannot be used, however, to hold some of the nation's
most highly radioactive spent fuel.

The new nickel-based alloy is laced with an element called gadolinium,
which is able to absorb extraordinary amounts of harmful radioactive
neutrons -- 60 times more than boron. The new alloy also can be shaped
into containers using conventional ingot metallurgy and fusion-welding
techniques.

The alloy was developed jointly by researchers at Lehigh University in
Bethlehem, Pa., Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., and
Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho.

A&M research reactors to use lower-grade uranium
Associated Press

COLLEGE STATION  The Department of Energy has begun to convert research
reactors at Texas A&M University and the University of Florida to use of
low-enriched uranium rather than high-enriched, weapons-grade uranium.
ADVERTISEMENT

Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman said in a statement today that DOE "is
committed to reducing the threat posed by the availability of
weapons-grade nuclear material here at home and around the world" and
use of low-enriched uranium at research reactors used for peaceful
purposes will help.

The conversion is part of a global threat reduction initiative announced
in May and led by DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration and the
Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology.

The initiative aims to identify, secure, remove and/or push for the
disposition of high-risk nuclear and other radiological material and
equipment that could pose a threat.

Of 25 research reactors in the United States targeted for conversion, 11
now use low-enriched uranium. DOE aims to convert A&M and the University
of Florida by late 2006, and complete all remaining conversions by 2014.

Group files to contest company's radioactive waste amendment

Associated Press

AUSTIN - An environmental group wants to fight a decision that would
allow a Dallas-based company to bring tons of radioactive waste to West
Texas.

The Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club filed paperwork Monday
requesting a hearing with state health officials on a license amendment
granted in February that allowed Waste Control Specialists to be
eligible to accept uranium byproduct waste from Fernald, Ohio, the site
of an old nuclear weapons processing plant run by the Department of
Energy.

State health officials approved expanding the WCS site's capacity from
250,000 cubic feet to 1.5 million cubic feet, enough waste to fill more
than 700 railroad cars.

WCS has also applied for a license to permanently dispose of the waste
at the site in far western Andrews County.

"The attempt by Waste Control Specialists to get approval to bring
another huge volume of radioactive waste to Texas is part of the
company's attempt to make our state a dumping ground for such wastes
from around the country - solely for the sake of the company's profits,"
Ken Kramer, director of the Texas chapter, said in a news release.

George Dials, president and chief executive officer for Waste Control,
declined to comment because he hasn't read the group's filing.

The company is the only one that has applied to handle the uranium
byproduct waste.

The energy department was expected to decide within a few weeks where
the uranium byproduct waste will be sent for storage.

If the State Office of Administrative Hearings decides the Sierra Club's
request has merit, it will make a recommendation to Eduardo Sanchez, the
state's commissioner of health, said Doug McBride, spokesman for the
Texas State Department of Health Services.

Regardless of what happens with Yucca, PFS wants Utah storage

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SALT LAKE CITY -- Regardless of what happens with plans to store nuclear
waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, Private Fuel Storage plans to press
ahead with is proposal to temporary store such waste in western Utah.

"We know there will be (a permanent repository) someplace. It's just a
question of where and when," said John Parkyn, chief executive officer
of the coalition of utility companies that has a deal with the Goshutes
to store depleted nuclear fuel rods on the Skull Valley Band's
reservation 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.

"PFS is just temporary. We aren't applying for a permanent storage
license and we don't want one," Parkyn said in an interview with The
Salt Lake Tribune's Washington office.

The $58 billion Yucca Mountain project is under fire following
revelations that scientists may have falsified research data concerning
the suitability of the Nevada site.

Meanwhile, PFS's proposal is coming up for final action by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. PFS is seeking a license for temporary storage of
44,000 tons of waste on the Skull Valley reservation.

"How can a facility be temporary when the place you're going to send it
-- Yucca Mountain -- isn't built?" said Dianne Nielson, director of the
Utah Department of Environmental Quality. "If Yucca Mountain isn't going
to be built, then the waste needs to stay where it is, at the reactor
sites in the control of the companies that generate it where it's quite
safe until a permanent solution can be found."

The state argued that point before the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, but the board rejected it. It likely will be part of the state's
case, either before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or before a
federal appeals court, Nielson said.

Last week, Nevada's governor, attorney general and congressional
delegation demanded a halt to the Yucca Mountain project pending federal
investigation.

"The evidence is becoming overwhelming that the Yucca Mountain program
is broken beyond repair," Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn said.

However, Theodore Garrish, deputy director of the Energy Department,
said his staff plans to double-check the data and, if the department
believes Yucca can be done safely, it will submit a license application
to the NRC by the end of the year.

"I can assure you we will not go forward unless we have the feeling
ourselves first that this repository will be safe," Garrish said.

Utah Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett supported Yucca
Mountain in the past. In 2002, they agreed to vote for the Yucca
Mountain project in exchange for a pledge from then Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card that federal
funds would not be used to help ship nuclear waste to the Goshute
facility, should it be approved.

However, Hatch said last week that while he will not stop supporting the
government's plan to store the waste in Nevada, he would be elated if
the administration decided to keep nuclear waste at the reactors that
produced it. And Bennett said earlier that he might favor leaving the
waste at the reactors.

Utah's three House members and Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. want the waste kept
where it is.

If plans for Yucca continue to crumble, Parkyn expects the Energy
Department to look again at sites it studied in the mid-1980s.

The Energy Department initially studied nine sites, including Davis and
Lavender Canyons in southeastern Utah. President Reagan narrowed the
list to Hanford, Wash., Deaf Smith County, Texas and Yucca Mountain.

 Andrews works to reverse population decrease

Andrews faces the same problem as many West Texas cities -- decreasing population.

According to city officials, Andrews' population in 2000 was 9,652 -- a
drop of 2,000 since the 1980s.

"The fact is Andrews is still 4A district," said Mayor Robert Zap,
referring to its high school's University Interscholastic League
classification. "We haven't suffered as have many of the towns that are
now 3A."

That notion makes Andrews different, but it is not the only one. While
the economic downtown of the mid-to-late 1990s had an effect which
carried over into the new millennium (like of loss of 500 students in
the last five to seven years), Andrews was better off fiscally than
other communities.

First, the city boasted no debt, a product of a pay-as-you-go attitude
embodied by Andrews leaders for years.

Second, the city stashed away millions of dollars of oil-generated
royalties. Its cash reserves by 2001 exceeded $20 million.

Advertisement Enertia Software

That foundation had been created by leaders, like former City Manager
Len Wilson, whose departure in 2001 left a vacancy ultimately filled by
former city of Midland Assistant City Manager Glen Hackler. It also
allowed city leaders to play a part in the design of a plan to upgrade
facilities, create an economic development program and decrease city
property taxes while challenging the city's fiscal conservatism.

The Andrews Strategic Action Plan, a community action plan, was
developed with specific goals in mind.

The ASAP set out goals that resulted in the creation of a hospital
district and passing of a bond election to make $30 million in
improvements to Andrews schools.

A main city responsibility has been economic development, specifically
creating an ED department and hiring its director of business
development, DeeDee Wallace. So far, both have been accomplished. The
real test for city officials will come in May when a referendum goes
before the public, which would raise the city's sales tax by three
quarters of a cent to 8 cents.

A half cent would go toward funding economic development, raising an
estimated $400,000 a year.

A quarter-cent would go toward lowering the city's property tax rate,
which would decrease to below 20 cents per hundred dollar valuation and
put Andrews among the lowest five rates in the state, according to
Hackler.

"This town has done a number of things to hold on to the population we
have," said Kitty Bristow, Andrews' finance director and city secretary.
"It is a battle for a small West Texas town."

The city's investment includes more than $1 million toward the building
of the business and technology center, a cooperative effort with Andrews
County, Odessa College and the University of Texas of the Permian Basin.

Other community investments include $5 million by the hospital district
in a nursing home and just less than $1 million in a senior activity
center -- mainly city and county funds. A 50-acre business park also has
been created. In city investments, there is nearly $300,000.

"(The Andrews community has) spent just less than $50 million in public
investment in the community," Hackler said. "In a community of 10,000,
that is huge. Our total accessed valuation inside city limits is $200
million.  Communities sometimes take 20-30 years to do the same thing.

"I think we are in a pivotal period of time," Hackler added. "We will
know the impact in five years. The 2010 Census will be telling for us."

Hackler, city officials said, has been influential in implementing those
changes set by community leaders prior to his arrival. Wallace said
Hackler has been a visionary, building collaboration between entities
and "making this happen without ego at all."

Hackler said Andrews' potential success has everything to do with the
ASAP's creation and the realization years ago their current leaders
could implement changes for the next 30-50 years.

"They put us in a good financial situation," Hackler said. "That is
being fiscally responsible."

Zap said the city has participated in the community development with
most of the city's $20 million in reserves still in tact.

"We haven't depleted too much," Zap said.

That is not the fiscal responsibility the Andrews community has come to
expect. Because while Andrews has no intention of wasting away like many
West Texas cities and towns, there is a price that is too high.

Waste request causes sparks
Activist groups follow license amendment

By Ruth Campbell
Odessa American

ANDREWS COUNTY The Sierra Club is not the only group concerned about
Waste Control Specialists getting permission from the state to take more
waste.

The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club on Monday filed for a contested
case hearing on the issue. Public Citizen and the League of Women Voters
among other organizations are also tracking the matter, according to
Richard Simpson, an adviser to Public Citizen in Austin.

The State Department of Health Services granted a license amendment to
Waste Control Feb. 23 allowing the company to store 1.5 million cubic
feet of waste at its western Andrews County site. Previously, it could
store 250,000 cubic feet.

The amendment would allow Waste Control to receive and "temporarily"
house more than 1 million cubic feet of uranium radioactive waste from
Fernald, Ohio, the site of an old nuclear weapons processing plant run
by the United States Department of Energy.

The DOE has not yet announced where it will send the Fernald waste.

Richard Ratliff, radiation program officer for the state health
department, said a hearing officer will determine if Sierra Club has
standing for a contested case hearing Ñ which is like a court hearing.
Historically, he said you have to be an affected person to have
standing.

Simpson said group members have to achieve standing on their own.

An affected person is someone who has or will suffer actual injury or
economic damage from action by Waste Control, in this case, Ratliff
said. The affected person also has to live in the county hosting the
site or in an adjacent county.

If the State Office of Administrative Hearings decides the Sierra Club's
hearing request has merit, it will make a recommendation to State Health
Commissioner Dr. Eduardo Sanchez. Sanchez will make the decision on
whether to let WCS take the waste or stop them, Ratliff said.

The license amendment means Waste Control can take waste from almost
anywhere Ñ something that alarms Sierra Club and Public Citizen.

Simpson said Public Citizen's concern centers on the amount of waste to
be transported to the site Ñ 3,500 truckloads, the highly concentrated
nature of the Fernald waste and the fact that terrorists may want to get
their hands on it.

"It's a very unusual kind of uranium byproduct," Simpson said. "It's
much more concentrated and the (radioactive) activity level is much
higher."

WCS spokesman Chuck McDonald said the company has worked closely with
the state health department and will continue to do so.

"We feel like it's already been clearly demonstrated that the Andrews
site is ideal for storing this waste because the geology's perfect, we
now have a record of excellence and, as was demonstrated the other night
(at a public hearing March 31 in Andrews), there is unparalleled
community support for the work that WCS is doing there," he said.

"I think it's obvious that neither the Sierra Club nor Public Citizen
are speaking on behalf of the citizens of Andrews with their request,"
McDonald said.

WCS has also applied for a license from the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality to permanently dispose of low-level radioactive
waste.

Sierra Club seeks hearing on radioactive waste
Publish Date: April 14, 2005  |  Permanent Link


By Dallas Baxter
Staff writer

    The Sierra Club has filed a request for a contested case hearing on
    the decision of the Texas Department of State Health Services (State
    Health Department) to allow Waste Control Specialists (WCS) to
    increase the volume of radioactive waste that may be stored at its
    waste site in Andrews County.

    WCS applied to the State Health Department to amend its license so
    it could receive and "temporarily" house more than 1 million cubic
    feet of uranium radioactive waste from the site of an old nuclear
    weapons processing plant in Ohio.

    An estimated 3,500 tanker truckloads are anticipated to transport
    the wastes from Ohio to Andrews County. The Sierra Club fears that
    the temporary storage could become permanent since, once in Texas,
    it will have no other place to go. Neither Nevada nor Utah will
    accept this waste.

    The governor of Arizona requested that the waste not be transported
    through Arizona. The waste contains a much higher level of
    radioactivity and volatility than other uranium waste.

    Ken Kramer, Texas state director for the Sierra Club, said the WCS
    facility in Andrews County was not engineered to be a permanent
    disposal site for this type of waste and that the safeguards are not
    in place to protect the public.

First Shipment of MOX Fuel for U.S. Reactor Arrives
CHARLESTON, South Carolina, April 13, 2005 (ENS) - A ship containing the
first U.S. cargo of mixed oxide (MOX) nuclear fuel arrived in the United
States from France on Tuesday. Composed of the mixed oxides of uranium
and plutonium, this batch of MOX fuel was made in France from U.S.
weapons-grade plutonium by the French state company Areva.

It will be tested in a U.S. reactor operated by Duke Energy, a member of
a consortium that aims to build the first U.S. MOX fuel factory at the
Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

The plutonium is from weapons-grade nuclear material that the federal
government is attempting to convert to peaceful use as MOX fuel for
nuclear reactors. The DOE's program covers the disposal of surplus
weapons grade plutonium in both the U.S. and Russia.

But the environmental group Greenpeace says the MOX fuel shipment flies
in the face of global efforts to curb the nuclear threat.

"While the U.S. warns the world about the risks of proliferation of
weapons material, here it is engaged in the very act it condemns. It is
pure hypocrisy," said Tom Clements of Greenpeace International. "All
transport and use of plutonium must end if we are to halt the spread of
nuclear weapons."

Activists working with Greenpeace monitored the arrival of the
UK-flagged Pacific Pintail, which was escorted into Charleston by U.S.
Coast Guard and local police vessels. Six casks containing nuclear fuel
will be off-loaded at the Charleston Naval Weapons Station.

Part of the of the nuclear load will be transported 1,500 miles to the
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico for storage.

The remainder will become part of a three year nuclear fuel experiment
at Duke Energy's Catawba nuclear reactor near Rock Hill, South Carolina.
Activists concerned about the possible escape of radiation into the
environment should there be a truck accident or other incident will
monitor the MOX transport along the 211 mile route to the Catawba
reactor.

On March 3, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a
license to authorize Duke's use of four MOX fuel assemblies at the
Catawba power station. Before MOX fuel can be used in significant
quantities, the assemblies must be irradiated in a reactor to confirm
they will perform predictably. Irradiation of assemblies is a step
towards permanent licensing for use of MOX fuel in the United States.

On March 30, the NRC authorized the consortium of Duke, Cogema, Stone &
Webster to construct a facility at the Savannah River Site to
manufacture MOX fuel for eventual use in commercial nuclear power
plants.

The NRC says its staff "performed environmental and safety reviews to
ensure that the facility's design will have minimal environmental
impacts and will protect the public health and safety."

The facility, which will be owned by the DOE's National Nuclear Security
Administration, is part of a bilateral effort between the United States
and Russia to make supplies of surplus weapons-grade plutonium into more
proliferation-resistant forms. Converting the plutonium into MOX fuel
will enable it to be used in commercial reactors to generate
electricity.

Energy Secretary Sanual Bodman said April 1, "We look forward to
proceeding with this nonproliferation program that will ultimately
eliminate enough plutonium for thousands of nuclear weapons in both
countries."

The United States and Russia are scheduled to begin site preparation
activities for MOX fuel factories both countries this spring, with full
construction of both facilities planned to begin in fiscal year 2006.

More than 30 nuclear reactors currently use MOX fuel in France, Germany,
Belgium and Switzerland, but no U.S. reactors have ever used the fuel.

Greenpeace recommends that all plutonium to be treated as nuclear waste
not as potential reactor fuel. "This approach would be cheaper, faster,
safer, and more secure," says the group, which also urges a ban on the
production of all weapons-usable fissile materials. Groups working with
Greenpeace include Georgians Against Nuclear Energy, Charleston Peace,
and the Carolina Peace Resource Centre.

STP, county work on new contract

Erika Koenig
Bay City Tribune

Published April 17, 2005

Negotiations between the county and STP to increase the amount of money
STP pays for emergency services are continuing  both parties plan to
have a final agreement in the next several months.

Under the present contract created in 2000, STP pays the county about
$3.4 million a year to provide offsite emergency response services for
the plant.

Matagorda General Hospital receives $1 million annually under a similar
agreement.

The hospitals contract will remain unchanged for now.

STP  like all nuclear power plants  is required by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to practice its emergency plan with local
officials at least once every two years to ensure proficiency.

To fulfill this rule, the county and hospital take turns participating
in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) graded exercises where
multiple entities of the county provide off-site response to a simulated
plant emergency.

This is a performance-based service contract, said County Judge Greg
Westmoreland.

If we dont do a good job, we dont get paid. We do always get high
marks in the drills, said Westmoreland.

Based on this record, the county is asking to raise the services fee by
nearly $1 million to $4.2 million.

The county is asking for more money to offset the $1 million less in
property taxes STP owners pay the county following AEPs sale of its
25.2 percent share of the company  12 percent to the City of San
Antonio and 13.2 percent to Texas Genco.

The portion of the company now owned by San Antonio  40 percent  is
tax exempt, because cities are not taxed on their holdings.

AEPs shares also sold for less than their appraised value, which
brought their taxable value down.

Losing $1 million from its $15 million budget would have a dramatic
effect on the county, said Westmoreland.

That is why we are working so hard to take up that shortfall. The
negotiations are going well, said Westmoreland. I feel confident it
will all work out.

The talks are going well, agreed STPNOC President and CEO Joe
Sheppard.

We expect to reach a resolution that is mutually beneficial to all
sides in plenty of time for the countys budget planning cycle for 2006,
that is, sometime this summer, said Sheppard.

Besides trying to recover lost tax dollars, Westmoreland believes the
fee should be increased because more service requirements are necessary
post-9/11.

The county is working on a buffer-zone protection plan to provide
security for the area surrounding the plant, said Matagorda County
Emergency Management Coordinator Bob Watts.

There also are additional counter-terrorism measures being put in place,
said Watts.

Westmoreland and Sheppard see the benefit of working together for the
community.

The owners and senior management of STP have been very cognizant of the
needs of the county and its taxpayers, said Westmoreland.

They are very good corporate partners.

The county and STP both have responsibilities to ensure that public
health and safety are protected, said Sheppard.

Many of these responsibilities are mandated by the federal government.

Our agreement is a good mechanism for formalizing those mutual
responsibilities and assuring clarity in our expectations of each
other, he added.

It is a good communications tool that minimizes any misunderstanding
and helps to maximize the effectiveness of our joint efforts.

Regardless of what happens with Yucca, PFS wants Utah storage

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SALT LAKE CITY -- Regardless of what happens with plans to store nuclear
waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, Private Fuel Storage plans to press
ahead with is proposal to temporary store such waste in western Utah.

"We know there will be (a permanent repository) someplace. It's just a
question of where and when," said John Parkyn, chief executive officer
of the coalition of utility companies that has a deal with the Goshutes
to store depleted nuclear fuel rods on the Skull Valley Band's
reservation 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.

"PFS is just temporary. We aren't applying for a permanent storage
license and we don't want one," Parkyn said in an interview with The
Salt Lake Tribune's Washington office.

The $58 billion Yucca Mountain project is under fire following
revelations that scientists may have falsified research data concerning
the suitability of the Nevada site.

Meanwhile, PFS's proposal is coming up for final action by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. PFS is seeking a license for temporary storage of
44,000 tons of waste on the Skull Valley reservation.

"How can a facility be temporary when the place you're going to send it
-- Yucca Mountain -- isn't built?" said Dianne Nielson, director of the
Utah Department of Environmental Quality. "If Yucca Mountain isn't going
to be built, then the waste needs to stay where it is, at the reactor
sites in the control of the companies that generate it where it's quite
safe until a permanent solution can be found."

The state argued that point before the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, but the board rejected it. It likely will be part of the state's
case, either before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or before a
federal appeals court, Nielson said.

Last week, Nevada's governor, attorney general and congressional
delegation demanded a halt to the Yucca Mountain project pending federal
investigation.

"The evidence is becoming overwhelming that the Yucca Mountain program
is broken beyond repair," Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn said.

However, Theodore Garrish, deputy director of the Energy Department,
said his staff plans to double-check the data and, if the department
believes Yucca can be done safely, it will submit a license application
to the NRC by the end of the year.

"I can assure you we will not go forward unless we have the feeling
ourselves first that this repository will be safe," Garrish said.

Utah Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett supported Yucca
Mountain in the past. In 2002, they agreed to vote for the Yucca
Mountain project in exchange for a pledge from then Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card that federal
funds would not be used to help ship nuclear waste to the Goshute
facility, should it be approved.

However, Hatch said last week that while he will not stop supporting the
government's plan to store the waste in Nevada, he would be elated if
the administration decided to keep nuclear waste at the reactors that
produced it. And Bennett said earlier that he might favor leaving the
waste at the reactors.

Utah's three House members and Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. want the waste kept
where it is.

If plans for Yucca continue to crumble, Parkyn expects the Energy
Department to look again at sites it studied in the mid-1980s.

The Energy Department initially studied nine sites, including Davis and
Lavender Canyons in southeastern Utah. President Reagan narrowed the
list to Hanford, Wash., Deaf Smith County, Texas and Yucca Mountain.

BBC: Climate change 'disaster by 2026'
Polar bears (University College London)
Polar bears are at risk of dying out if the Arctic summer sea ice melts
Dangerous levels of climate change could be reached in just over 20
years if nothing is done to stop global warming, a WWF-UK study claims.

At current rates, the Earth will be 2C above pre-industrial levels some
time between 2026 and 2060, says a paper by Dr Mark New of Oxford
University.

Temperatures in the Arctic could rise by three times this amount, he
says.

It would lead to a loss of summer sea ice and tundra vegetation, with
polar bears and other animals dying out.


Polar bears will be consigned to history, something that our
grandchildren can only read about in books Dr Catarina Cardoso

It would also mean a fundamental change in the ways Inuit and other
Arctic residents live.

Dr New said: "A very robust result from global climate models is that
warming due to greenhouse gases will reduce the amount of snow and ice
cover in the Arctic, which will in turn produce an additional warming as
more solar radiation is absorbed by the ground and the ocean."

Ice and snow reflect more solar radiation back to space than unfrozen
surfaces.

According to the WWF, the perennial ice, or summer sea ice, is currently
melting at a rate of 9.6% per decade and will disappear completely by
the end of the century if present trends continue.

Birds affected

Boreal forests would spread north and overwhelm up to 60% of dwarf shrub
tundra, a critical habitat and vital breeding ground for many birds.

"If we don't act immediately, the Arctic will soon become
unrecognisable," said Dr Catarina Cardoso, head of climate change at
WWF-UK.

"Polar bears will be consigned to history, something that our
grandchildren can only read about in books."

Dr New's paper - Arctic Climate Change with a 2C Global Warming - is one
of four papers contributing to a report by WWF.

The papers will be presented at the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change
conference in Exeter between 1 and 3 February. The conference has been
organised by the UK's Met Office.

 Andrews economic development, tax decrease at stake in May 7 election
Bob Campbell
Midland Reporter Telegram
04/20/2005

ANDREWS -- Phase 3 of the 5-year-old ASAP (Andrews Strategic Action
Plan) to secure health care, public school education and economic
diversification is at stake in the May 7 municipal election.

With the county hospital district approved four years ago and $31
million school bond issue in 2002, the vote will decide a half-cent
economic development tax and quarter-cent sales tax to cut property
taxes by at least 10 cents per $100 in valuation.

Early voting opens today at Andrews City Hall at 111 Logsdon Ave. and
goes through May 3, running 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
"Because the citizens have strongly supported Waste Control Specialists
for 10 years, they understand the need for diversification," Andrews
Industrial Foundation Chairman Lloyd Eisenrich said Tuesday.

"We're trying to make sure we have a viable economic development program
in place if oil drops below $50 a barrel again. Under state law, the
only way you can fund a program is with the tax. We've got to have it if
we're going to compete."

Eisenrich said 160 people took part in ASAP meetings to develop the
three-pronged plan. WCS operates a nuclear waste repository west of
town.

The only other May 7 issues are the uncontested city council bids of
incumbents Charles Vogt, Flora Braly and Ron McCormick, so the ED and
sales taxes should get the appropriate attention, said City Manager Glen
Hackler. School elections also will be held that Saturday.

Hackler said the ED tax will produce $400,000 a year to finance bids and
business incentives and the sales tax would lower property taxes from
29.85 cents per $100 in valuation to under 20 cents. That would put
Andrews among the five least-taxed cities in Texas, Hackler said,
explaining the state comptroller would set the new rate this fall.

"Andrews, Kermit and Alpine are the only cities over 5,000 population in
West Texas without an ED tax," he said. "I hear positive comments but
not a lot of conversation, which hopefully means it's not controversial.
There hasn't been any organized opposition.

"We feel like we have laid the foundation by acquiring land and
developing the Business Park, passing tax abatement incentives and
starting construction on the Business and Technology Center on Northwest
Avenue D. Odessa College and UTPB will provide workforce development
training, vocational education and lower level and some higher level
college courses."

Hackler said the B&T Center will be completed in January 2006, adding,
"It's a wonderful thing."

He said the city hired a talented business development director in Dee
Dee Wallace and now should move forward with its ED initiatives.

State studies plan for radioactive waste

Group fears dump in Adams Co. would be a 'stepping stone'

By Todd Hartman, Rocky Mountain News
April 21, 2005

Adams County soon may be home to an unusual waste dump, one permitted to
take a largely benign type of radioactive material that few places in
the country accept.

State health officials are preparing to decide whether Deer Trail
landfill in southeastern Adams County can accept the material, which
poses a low risk for people but has still sparked scattered opposition
in a region where cattle, buffalo and rattlesnakes far outnumber
residents.


Chief among opponents is a competing company with waste sites in Idaho,
Washington and Texas. That firm, American Ecology, has hired a local
lobbyist to scrutinize the plan.

The Deer Trail landfill has accepted various hazardous wastes since
1991.

Now its corporate owner is asking the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment for permission to accept a kind of radioactive
material that is common here, but sometimes has to be shipped out of
state for legal disposal at higher costs.

Opponents fear that Deer Trail's owner, Massachusetts-based Clean
Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. simply wants to use the radioactive
material as a "stepping stone" for more dangerous, and lucrative,
radioactive wastes.

"They want to get their foot in the door so they can go after bigger and
better things," said Pam Whelden, a nearby resident and chairwoman of
Concerned Citizens of Eastern Colorado, an activist group that organized
to oppose the landfill in the 1980s.

Phillip Retallick, a senior vice president for Clean Harbors, said that
isn't the case.

To prove it, he said, Clean Harbors officials have pledged to enter into
a legally binding agreement - called an environmental covenant - with
state health regulators that would restrict the type of radioactive
waste allowed at the site. The agreement would run with the site and
encumber any future operators as well.

"Clean Harbors has committed not to apply for higher limits," Retallick
said.

"The environmental covenant gives participating local governments
control over future changes in the licensing of this site."

Fewer options for disposal

At issue is a type of radioactive waste classified as "naturally
occurring" and "technologically enhanced naturally occurring"
radioactive material.

Sources of such material include leftover sludge from drinking water
treatment, road excavations, and residue from oil and gas drilling.

Abbreviated as NORM and TENORM, the material is distinctive from
man-made radioactive waste, such as at Rocky Flats or other Department
of Energy facilities. Nor does it include radioactive wastes associated
with nuclear power, medical uses or mill tailings from uranium
processing.

"All materials proposed for disposal at the facility . . . are literally
a trillion times less 'radioactive' than other wastes routinely shipped
from Colorado to other states," according to a statement issued by Clean
Harbors.

Historically, health department officials have allowed some disposal of
NORM and TENORM in certain municipal landfills. But regulators say that
federal rule changes to drinking water treatment have created more
situations where disposal of the wastes in typical landfills could be
more difficult.

That makes the Deer Trail site, and all of its already built-in
environmental protections, an important consideration, said Doug
Benevento, executive director of the state health department.

He said that many cities and utilities that end up with NORM and TENORM
waste after treating drinking water need more options for disposal.

"This is going to give a central location for all municipalities, and
it's going to be pretty inexpensive, relative to what they're paying
now," Benevento said.

Benevento also cited an ongoing Superfund cleanup in Denver requiring
disposal of radium-tainted materials that were laid down as fill for
decades under several Denver streets. That material now goes to a waste
site in Idaho, one owned by American Ecology.

But it could be disposed of at Deer Trail, if the state determines that
the site is suitable.

The lower transportation costs would save the state money, Benevento
said.

But that argument hasn't convinced some opponents, including Adams
County commissioners, who say that state approval of the plan would
break a promise made in 1983, when the county OK'd the project on the
condition that the facility wouldn't accept radioactive wastes.

But Retallick said that the company wouldn't have sought state
permission to accept the new wastes unless they had been in conformance
with earlier agreements with Adams County.

He said the company has sought a meeting with commissioners and will
renew that request in coming days, in hopes of resolving any
differences.

Comments sought

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment will host a
community meeting about the proposal to accept certain radioactive
wastes at the Deer Trail landfill.

---  When: 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. today

Lawmaker wants further study of radioactive waste
Rep. Gallego proposes risk analysis
Odessa American

Rep. Pete Gallego has proposed a resolution to study the risks of
importing radioactive waste into Texas.

A public hearing on House Concurrent Resolution 85 is set for 8 a.m.
today in Austin before the House Energy Resources Committee, a news
release said.

Gallego wants the joint committee to take public testimony and then
offer recommendations to the governor and Texas Legislature for action
before the next regular session.

"There is no reason West Texas should be the national dumping ground for
nuclear waste. It saddens me to think that the natural beauty of West
Texas could be destroyed. We need to preserve West Texas for future
generations," Gallego said in a news release.

"We need some answers to important questions before this potentially
dangerous and destructive process moves forward," he said. "We need to
investigate and identify all the liabilities that exist, examine whether
or not our state highway system is equipped to handle thousands of tons
of radioactive waste, and determine if we have the proper regulatory
framework in place to ensure the safety of Texans."

Under current law, sources across the United States Ñ including nuclear
power plants, nuclear arms production facilities, surface and uranium
mines could apply to send radioactive waste mixed with other toxic
chemicals for permanent storage in Texas.

Waste Control Specialists already stores low-level radioactive waste at
its site in Andrews County near the New Mexico border. The amendment,
granted by the state Department of Health Services Feb. 23, allows WCS
to temporarily house more than 1 million cubic feet of uranium
radioactive waste.

The company put in a bid to take waste from an old nuclear weapons
processing plant in Fernald, Ohio. Waste Control also applied


for a license through the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to
dispose of low-level radioactive waste.

Sierra Club has requested a contested case hearing on the health
department's decision to grant the license amendment.

"The WCS facility in Andrews County was not engineered to be a permanent
disposal site for this type of waste," Ken Kramer, director of the Lone
Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said. "The safeguards are not in place
to protect the public from the many risks associated with the type and
magnitude of radioactive waste. Moreover, Texans have no guarantee that
WCS will remain in business long after getting its profit from the site,
leaving our state with an abandoned radioactive waste site."

Town embraces radioactive waste storage, disposal industry

BETSY BLANEY

Associated Press

ANDREWS, Texas - This small West Texas town grew
its economy on oil but may hang its hopes on what
some folks believe is their next boom: storage and
disposal of radioactive waste.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists owns 14,400
acres about 30 miles outside town near the New
Mexico border. About 1,340 acres are set aside for
hazardous waste storage and disposal, and the
company will manage tons of federal uranium
byproduct waste by year's end.

Some residents believe the site will bring dozens
of jobs from spin-off industries, and city leaders
anticipate it will pump millions of dollars into
the economy. It's a reverse NIMBY - not in my back
yard - with Andrews welcoming the radioactive
waste rather than fighting to keep it out.

"If we thought we could get an NFL franchise or a
Riverwalk, we wouldn't have looked at this
industry," said Russell Shannon, vice president of
the Andrews Industrial Foundation, a privately
funded group formed decades ago to help attract
companies to the city. "We just believe it will
bring us some jobs, bring people to our community
to get involved in an industry, like they did with
oil."

The town was incorporated in 1937, about eight
years after oil was struck in Andrews County. By
1956, the county led the nation in oil production,
pumping more than 60 million barrels annually.

The oil boom lasted through the 1960s, fell off
and then picked up again in the early 1980s. But
gradually the oil business dwindled, along with
the town's population. In the late 1990s, Andrews
hit another national high, this time with double
digit unemployment, as oil prices sunk to $8 a
barrel.

Residents hope the waste site will turn around
Andrews' fortunes. On Thursday, they learned the
site will become the storage destination for tons
of Department of Energy uranium byproduct waste
now at the abandoned Fernald federal plant, just
northwest of Cincinnati.

Shipments from Fernald could begin as early as
late May and probably will be completed by year's
end.

The Fernald plant processed and purified uranium
metal for use in reactors to produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons from the 1950s until it ended
production in 1989.

Waste Control Specialists has an application
pending with the Texas Department of State Health
Services to dispose of the uranium byproduct
waste. A decision could come early next year.

If approved, some lawmakers want the state to
profit. Sen. Robert Duncan, a Lubbock Republican,
has proposed a bill that would give the state 10
percent of gross receipts for waste storage,
processing and disposal, plus a surcharge based on
the level of radioactivity. That money would come
from Waste Control, the only company to apply for
Texas permits to handle the radioactive material.

However, Rep. Mike Villarreal, a San Antonio
Democrat, has introduced a bill to limit
radioactive waste storage and disposal in Texas. A
bill passed by legislators in 2003 allowed for
low-level waste from Texas and Vermont to come to
the state. Villarreal's measure would prohibit
other states from approaching Texas about taking
their radioactive waste.

Waste Control has stored, treated and disposed of
hazardous waste at the Andrews site since 1997. In
February, the state approved the company's request
to expand the storage capacity to 1.5 million
cubic feet - nearly five times its current size -
making it eligible to accept the Ohio waste. The
expansion space is the equivalent of about 800
railroad cars.

George Dials, president and chief executive
officer for Waste Control, said the expansion was
necessary for the company's long-term plans to
assist federal plants with site clean up and
disposal of low-level waste.

Andrews appeared to have little competition for
the Fernald waste. Nevada officials threatened a
lawsuit if the DOE sent the waste to a
government-run site north of Las Vegas. Residents
near a private waste site in Clive, Utah - west of
Salt Lake City - also rejected it.

While the legislative and administrative wrangling
in Texas continues, environmentalists worry about
how the waste will effect the air, soil and water.

An 800-foot-deep layer of red clay rises to near
the surface at the site, which Andrews city
leaders and company officials say makes the site
geologically sound.

But Melanie Barnes, a geology researcher at Texas
Tech University and chairwoman of the League of
Women Voters of Texas' hazardous waste program,
said surface fractures exist and she's unsure how
deep they go. A major concern is that if the waste
seeps through the soil, it could affect the Santa
Rosa and Ogallala aquifers.

The Ogallala is a primary source of drinking water
in West Texas, and at least one ranch near the
waste site uses the Santa Rosa to provide water
for livestock.

"I believe that the long-term storage and/or
disposal of radioactive material at this site is
extremely dangerous for the health and well being
of future generations," rancher John Post wrote to
State Rep. Buddy West, R- Odessa. Post, whose
18,000-acre ranch is 11 miles from the waste site,
fears his land will be useless if the Santa Rosa
becomes polluted.

Other townspeople oppose the site, but they're in
the minority. Peggy Pryor, 54, has lived in
Andrews most of her life. She believes no good can
come from any type of radioactive waste.

"It's all about money and how much money they can
make, and it's not about the environment at all,"
said Pryor, a retired cardiac technician. "It just
tears me up."

Dials said the clay is impermeable to water. "By
and large there are no fractures that lead
anywhere and we're confident in the design," he
said. "We feel it will be safely contained and
isolated from the biosphere for tens of thousands
of years."

Cyrus Reed, a registered lobbyist for the Sierra
Club, said waste sites with clay beds in Maxey
Flats, Ky., and West Valley, N.Y. were touted as
impermeable, too. Contaminated groundwater was
found at each years after they opened.

"The point is there were previous sites where
people had made predictions that they were good
sites, and there would be no problems and there
were problems," he said.

The national environmental group has requested a
hearing before the Texas Department of State
Health Services to contest the state's decision to
allow Waste Control to expand its Andrews site. No
hearing date has been set.

Nuclear regulators place Texas on 'heightened oversight'

BETSY BLANEY

Associated Press

Federal officials threatened probation this week
for a Texas state agency that regulates nuclear
issues, citing concerns over late radiation
inspections and reporting due to staff shortages
and jobs left vacant for months.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission placed the Texas
Department of State Health Services on "heightened
oversight" and gave it 30 days to submit an
improvement plan, according to a letter to the
department dated Wednesday.

The "heightened oversight" status is one grade
above probation, NRC spokesman David McIntyre
said.

Since August 2001 when it got the best possible
rating, the department failed to notify the
commission of 37 of 160 reportable incidents
involving radioactive materials until long after
required deadlines, and 22 others needed
additional follow-up information, NRC documents
indicate.

Lack of staffing was cited by state health
officials for the late reporting and incomplete
data, documents show.

The NRC believes the department's program can
still "provide adequate protection" to the public
from radiation hazards, McIntyre said Friday.
Texas has had a strong history in its radiation
protection program, he said.

"However, we have identified several areas of
concern that if left uncorrected could seriously
degrade the program's ability to protect the
public's health and safety,"Ratliff said.

Richard Ratliff, the department's radiation
program officer, said steps related to NRC's
concerns were being taken before the letter
arrived. The problems stem from staffing shortages
in health physicist positions because salaries
have not been in line with the industry, he said.

But state auditors have recommended adding a new
pay classification for health physicists that
would put those positions within 5 percent of the
industry standard, Ratliff said. Legislators now
must approve the classification, he said. The
amount needed is about $350,000, he said.

"That in itself ... will be the greatest remedy to
the issues that the NRC has," Ratliff said.

The department is short seven positions, he said.

"The major part of it is we can't attract new
qualified people and retain the staff that we
train that we have here already," Ratliff said.

Eight health physicists have actually taken jobs
at the NRC's Arlington office, Ratliff said.

"The department has expressed a commitment to
resolving the problems as soon as possible,"
McIntyre said.

The letter came a day before Dallas-based Waste
Control Specialists won a $7.5 million, two-year
contract to store tons of radioactive waste from
an abandoned uranium processing plant in Ohio in
far west Andrews County, near the New Mexico
border. The department will regulate the waste's
storage.

In February, the department granted the company a
license amendment to expand capacity, which made
it eligible to take the Ohio waste.

Texas is one of 33 states that has an agreement
with the commission to monitor radiation issues
pertaining to industrial and medical uses.

Some of the institutions and industries over which
the department has oversight include Texas A&M
University, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the
University of Texas System, Texas Tech University
and Halliburton. In all, there are 1,600 radiation
materials licensees at 2,200 sites across the
state. Additionally, there are 16,000 X-ray sites
in Texas that the department inspects.

Ohio nuclear waste headed to Texas site

Dallas, TX, Apr. 29 (UPI) -- Low-level radioactive waste from a closed nuclear bomb materials plant in Ohio will be shipped to a special waste storage site in West Texas.

Waste Control Specialists will treat and store the material under a $7.5 million contract announced Thursday, The Dallas Morning News reported Friday.

The Dallas company will be able to dispose of the waste at the West Texas site when it receives a license from the Texas Department of Health, which should come in October.

The location in remote Andrews County near the New Mexico state line could become the destination for more waste. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to soon approve the transfer of waste from a closed nuclear power plant in Massachusetts.

The NRC recently threatened to put the Texas state radiation control program on probation. A review found inspections were overdue, staff experts had quit, and vacancies had gone unfilled for months.

State officials say the problems cited by the NRC resulted from budget cuts, noncompetitive salaries, and a 2003 reoganization. They assured that inspections of facilities like the one in Andrews County have not been delayed.

DOE awards contract to Waste Control
700 railcar loads of waste concerns Andrews rancher
By Ruth Campbell
Odessa American
ANDREWS COUNTY 

Waste Control Specialists was awarded a two-year $7.5
million contract Thursday to temporarily store tons of waste from a
defunct nuclear weapons processing plant in Fernald, Ohio.

Waste to be stored at the WCS site in western Andrews County would come
from Silos 1 and 2 at Fernald, according to Jeff Wagner, public affairs
officer for Fluor Fernald, the company charged with cleaning up the
Fernald site. Byproduct from Silo 3 went to Envirocare of Utah.

Shipments will start at the end of May and last until December, Wagner
said.

Waste Control President and Chief Operating Officer George Dials said he
was pleased with DOE's selection. The company employs 108 people in
Andrews County and 10 at its Dallas headquarters.

He said he appreciates the support from Andrews County residents.

"The site is a good site to store this material. It creates economic
opportunity for us and derives economic benefit for Andrews, Texas,"
Dials said, adding that a "few more" people would probably be hired as a
result of the contract.

Not everyone is happy about the contract though.

"I understand they're going to ship 700 railcar loads of radioactive
waste in. I think the fact that the site is over at least three aquifers
Ñ one of them a potable aquifer Ñ is a very short-sighted thing to do
because an earthquake could cause fissures in the red bed creating a
pathway for radioactivity to enter the water zone," longtime Andrews
County rancher John Post said.

Post, who has lived since 1934 in an area 11 miles south of what is now
Waste Control's site, said that he had heard some experts say the
radioactive waste being shipped in is higher level than is being stated.

"I don't like it," he said.

After treatment and packaging, the waste must meet all applicable
Department of Transportation requirements. Driving teams will call in at
pre-established intervals and each trailer will be tracked with GPS
technology, the release said.

Cyrus Reed, a lobbyist for the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club in
Austin, said the contract award doesn't surprise him, especially
considering no other state would take the waste.

"Waste Control Specialists was the only game in town for DOE and
Fernald. It's disappointing they would make this decision before the
process is complete," Reed said.

Reed is referring to a contested case hearing Sierra Club has requested
before the State Department of Health Services protesting the agency
granting a license amendment to WCS so it could take more low-level
radioactive waste.

The uranium byproduct will be mixed with fly ash and concrete and housed
in half-inch thick carbon steel containers. The containers will be
shipped on specially designed flatbed trucks, Wagner said.

"In all, we expect we'll need about 5,000 canisters to complete the
shipping campaign," he said.

Silos 1 and 2 contain about 8,900 cubic yards of silty clay-like
material from processing ore from the Belgian Congo in the early 1950s.
Silo 3 contains 5,100 cubic yards of powder-like residues from the
processing of Canadian and U.S. ores from the 1950s. The material has
been burned to reduce volume.

The Department of Energy will still own the waste.

Waste Control Specialists stores low-level radioactive waste at its site
in Andrews County near the New Mexico border.

The amendment, granted by the state Department of Health Services Feb.
23, allows WCS to temporarily house more than 1 million cubic feet of
uranium radioactive waste.

The company has also applied for a license to dispose of low-level
radioactive waste through the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
If the company gets the disposal license, it could dispose of the
Fernald waste.

Nuclear waste is headed to W. Texas

Shipments are start of big expansion; U.S. says state oversight lax

09:54 AM CDT on Friday, April 29, 2005

By RANDY LEE LOFTIS / The Dallas Morning News

West Texas on Thursday became the destination for
some of the nation's most troublesome Cold War-era
nuclear waste.

But the announcement that 3,500 truckloads of
uranium waste will head to Texas from a closed
nuclear bomb materials plant in Ohio is just the
start of a dramatic expansion of Texas'
importation of radioactive leftovers.  
The nuclear waste will be
stored in Andrews County.

The decision to send the waste to Dallas-based
Waste Control Specialists' facility in Andrews
County came just one day after federal officials
threatened to put the state's radiation control
program on probation.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, is
expected within two weeks to approve a
Northeastern utility's request to send Waste
Control Specialists 84 million pounds of
radioactive demolition debris from a closed
nuclear power plant in Massachusetts.

Texas environmental officials strongly objected
this week, challenging the NRC's authority to
allow the shipments. But even more shipments of
nuclear plant debris are possible.

The owner of another closed nuclear power plant in
Connecticut has asked the NRC to let it ship 100
million pounds of similar material to the West
Texas facility. And as more of the nation's
first-generation nuclear plants from the 1950s and
1960s close, they also could be dismantled and
shipped to the facility if the NRC prevails.

Other types of radioactive shipments to Waste
Control Specialists are likely as nuclear
operations open and existing waste facilities stop
accepting shipments. Nebraska, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas have asked about
shipping some of their radioactive waste to Texas.

Any of those shipments could travel through Dallas
and Fort Worth on Interstate 20, a designated
hazardous materials route.

'Heightened oversight'

As the state's role in taking nuclear materials
grows, however, a recent federal review found that
Texas radiation regulators couldn't handle many of
the tasks they have now.

Many inspections were overdue, staff experts had
quit and vacancies went unfilled for months, NRC
officials found after a check of Texas Department
of State Health Services files in March. In
addition, they said many incidents involving
radioactive materials weren't reported until long
after notification deadlines.

As a result, the NRC notified Texas on Wednesday
that the state is "in jeopardy of not being able
to fulfill its responsibility to protect public
health and safety."

In a letter to the state obtained by The Dallas
Morning News, the NRC placed the state program on
"heightened oversight," a step the commission said
could lead to probation or suspension of the
state's authority to regulate radiation.

Still, Waste Control Specialists president George
E. Dials promised that the company's facility,
Texas' only radioactive waste site, would protect
the public from risk.

"WCS has an excellent safety record and experience
in handling and storing similar types of materials
at its Andrews County facility," Mr. Dials said.

But state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, said the
state needs to consider its nuclear future more
carefully. He has filed a resolution to create a
legislative study committee to weigh the risks of
an expanded radioactive waste industry in Texas.

"In light of all these changes, it's pretty
irresponsible to move forward at this point," Mr.
Gallego said Thursday.

Legislative debate

The House Energy Resources Committee heard
testimony on the resolution Wednesday but took no
action. Environmental group lobbyists backed the
measure, but Waste Control Specialists lawyer
Michael Woodward testified that another study
would only postpone action needed to manage waste
safely.

"It is a reality in our country, and we can't just
bury our heads in the sand and expect this
material to take care of itself," Mr. Woodward
said.

However, Tom "Smitty" Smith, Texas director of
Public Citizen, said the state is headed down a
dangerous path paved by politics.

"The Pandora's box has been opened, just as we all
feared," he said.

The Fernald, Ohio, waste is expected to start
heading to Texas in late May. The material, which
Nevada and Utah rejected, was left after the plant
processed high-grade uranium ore into fuel for
reactors that made plutonium for bombs.

A contractor, Fluor Fernald, is dismantling and
decontaminating the plant for the U.S. Energy
Department.

The $7.5 million contract announced Thursday lets
Waste Control Specialists treat the waste and
store it until the company gets a state health
department license to dispose of it at the Andrews
County site. Health department regulators say that
license could come in October.

If that happens, Waste Control Specialists would
earn more money for disposing of the waste.
Without a disposal license, the facility could
keep the waste for only two years.

The company is also seeking a license to dispose
of low-level radioactive waste Ð mostly
contaminated tools, equipment, clothing and other
items from nuclear power plants, oil companies,
hospitals and other sources.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is
processing that application, with a decision
expected in 2007.

Needed change?

The split of radiation oversight duties between
the health department and the environmental agency
reflects one of the numerous shifts the
Legislature has made. Now a bill filed by Sen.
Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, would move all oversight
to the environmental agency.

Mr. Duncan maintains that the recent NRC review of
the health department's performance, which
occurred since he filed his bill, reinforces the
need to change. That bill, which also would put
new taxes on radioactive waste, is due for debate
in the full Senate today.

Alice Rogers, inspections unit manager with the
state health department, said the problems that
the NRC found resulted from budget shortfalls,
noncompetitive salaries and a 2003 legislative
reorganization of the department. She said the
department hopes the 2005 Legislature will fix
those problems.

High-priority inspections of facilities such as
Waste Control Specialists site haven't been
delayed, she added.

None of those factors directly affects the efforts
of the two Northeastern power companies to ship
their dismantled and demolished nuclear power
plants to Texas.

That's because the NRC is exempting such debris
from regulation as radioactive waste, meaning it
could be disposed of in Waste Control Specialists'
already approved hazardous waste disposal
landfill.

The NRC expects to approve the request for the
Yankee Rowe plant in Massachusetts within two
weeks, commission spokesman David McIntyre said.
The other request, for the Connecticut Yankee
plant in Connecticut, is pending, but the
commission has approved an alternative plan to let
Connecticut Yankee ship its debris to a facility
in Idaho.

Both plants still have extremely hazardous spent
nuclear fuel on their sites, but no spent fuel
would be sent to the Waste Control Specialists
site. Also, the most highly contaminated debris
would go to other facilities.

Texas objects

In a three-page letter dated Tuesday, the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality told the NRC
that nothing in Texas law or in Waste Control
Specialists' permits would allow the disposal of
nuclear plant demolition debris without state
approval.

Among the state agency's questions: If the
material is just routine hazardous waste, why ship
it 2,000 miles to West Texas, passing hundreds of
other facilities approved to take it?

The NRC has not yet responded.

Neither plant owner has made a final decision to
send its debris to Texas, said Kelley Smith, a
spokeswoman for both plants. A separate company
owns each plant, but the companies have several
investor-owners in common.

"Both companies are looking at all possible
options," Ms. Smith said.

Tons of uranium byproduct waste from an abandoned
plant in Ohio will be stored near Andrews, the
contractor cleaning up the Ohio site announced
Thursday.

An estimated 1.3 million cubic yards of waste,
enough to fill 800 railroad cars, will be trucked
to the site 30 miles west of Andrews. The site is
operated by Waste Control Specialists of Dallas.

Announced in Cincinnati by the Fluor Fernald Co.,
the agreement is worth $7.5 million and covers two
years of interim storage at the site.

The U.S. Energy Department still owns the waste,
which will be at the site for two years as the
department looks for a long-term storage or
disposal arrangement. Waste Control also wants to
dispose of the waste and has an application
pending with the Texas Department of State Health
Services.

Andrews County Judge Richard Dolgener Thursday
expressed confidence the materials will be handled
safely. "We've been dealing with WCS for 10 years
and believe them to be a good company to work with
and a good community partner," he said.

"They use all safeguards and follow the rules set
down by governing agencies," Dolgener said, adding
Andrews leaders aren't worried WCS will go out of
business and leave the site in a dangerous state.
"That county is sitting on a single source river
by Fernald, Ohio, leading into Cincinnati.

"If we can help them out, I think counties should
help other counties."

In February, state officials OK'd a license
amendment expanding the plant's capacity from
250,000 cubic feet to 1.5 million cubic feet. The
change made WCS eligible to receive the waste from
the abandoned Fernald plant northwest of
Cincinnati.

The Sierra Club, a national environmental group,
has requested a hearing to contest the amendment.
No date has been set.

Club spokesman Ken Kramer of Austin is skeptical
"because there was no discussion at all about this
type of waste two years ago, when the radioactive
waste law was changed to allow a private company
to get a license," he said.

"Our big concern is that WCS keeps having new
waste streams magically appear that they want to
obtain for disposal at their site," Kramer said.
"Texas seems to be incrementally becoming the
place of last resort or first option for any kind
of radioactive waste people want to get rid of.

"WCS wants to maximize their profit, so the more
waste they can bring in, the greater their profit
and the bigger the headache for us if they go
belly-up."

Fernald purified uranium for use in reactors to
make plutonium for nuclear weapons from the 1950s
until ending production in 1989.

Waste Control seeks a state license to dispose of
low-level radioactive waste, including
contaminated clothing or tools, most from
commercial nuclear plants. Now it can treat and
store the waste but must send it elsewhere for
disposal.

WCS President George Dials of Dallas said the
trucks will bring in "fewer than 5,000" barrels
made of half inch-thick carbon steel to go on an
asphalt pad a quarter-mile northeast of the plant
where waste from Texas hospitals and nuclear
facilities is already being stored.

Six feet, 6 inches tall and 6 feet in diameter,
each barrel will hold 196 cubic feet of waste
mixed with concrete, Dials said. They'll start
arriving in late May.

When asked if the Sierra Club's dubiety is
well-founded, Dials said, "I think it's misplaced.
We have an excellent facility and a workforce with
a strong safety record. We'll celebrate four years
without a lost work time injury in May.

"This material is not extraordinarily hotter than
the stuff we've dealt with before. We have been
processing and storing some pretty interesting
waste streams."

Dials said concerns about unsafe transportation
are invalid because it's regulated by the U.S.
Department of Transportation and Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. "There are thousands of
shipments across the U.S. every year, and there
have never been any public health injuries from
radiation exposure due to the shipment of
radioactive materials," he said.

Dials said two-man crews will handle the trucks.
"Driving teams will call in at pre-established
intervals and each trailer will be tracked with
Global satellite Positioning (System) technology,"
he said.

WCS is a subsidiary of Valhi Inc., which deals in
chemicals, component products, waste management
and titanium in more than 100 North American,
European and Asian countries.

Fernald waste on its way out
Nuclear leftovers to go to dump site in Texas

By Dan Klepal
Enquirer staff writer
FERNALD HISTORY

1951: Fernald opens.

Early 1950s: Silos constructed.

1952-1957: Silos filled with residue left over from uranium extraction.

1989: Uranium production halted.

1993: U.S. Department of Energy decides to encase the waste in glass, a
process known as vitrification.

1997: A General Accounting Office investigation finds lax oversight by
the DOE led to $65 million in cost overruns at the failed vitrification
plant. Another $30 million, spent on research and study, was lost when
the project was scrapped.

2003: Utah citizens protest a plan to send silo waste to Envirocare near
Salt Lake City. Officials there eventually bow to public pressure and
refuse the waste.

April 2004: Just weeks before waste is to be removed from one silo, the
Nevada Attorney General threatens a federal lawsuit to stop the planned
shipments of silo waste to the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles outside Las
Vegas, leaving Fernald project officials with nowhere to ship the waste
and an approaching 2006 deadline to complete the job.

April 28, 2005: DOE officials award a $7.5 million contract to Waste
Control Specialists of Andrews, Texas, to store the silo waste. Waste
Control Specialists is pursuing a license that would allow it to
permanently dispose of the material at its site in West Texas.

May 2005: Shipments are scheduled to begin.

CROSBY TWP. - The most dangerous nuclear waste at the $4.4 billion
Fernald uranium foundry should be gone by the end of the year - more
than 16 years after cleanup of the Cold War relic began and after tens
of millions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on the project that has been
fraught with delays and safety concerns from the beginning.

Removal of the waste will represent the biggest step forward in the
cleanup so far - and one of the last hurdles that the government has had
to clear - because it is the one project at the 1,050-acre site that has
faced the most uncertain future. That's because three previous plans for
dealing with the waste have fallen through, most recently last April.

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded a $7.5 million contract Thursday
to Waste Control Specialists, of Andrews, Texas, for the temporary
storage of more than 10,000 tons of the radioactive waste with a
consistency of peanut brittle. The material has been stored in concrete
silos at the long-closed Fernald uranium foundry since the early 1950s
and has been the major source of safety concerns for nearby residents
since the cleanup began in 1989.

Waste Control Specialists has applied for a license that would allow it
to permanently dispose of the material at its site in west Texas.

However, a decision on that won't be made for about a year. Regardless,
federal rules governing the cleanup say the waste cannot come back to
Ohio after it's moved.

"That's the important thing: Once it's gone, it ain't comin' back," said
Lisa Crawford, who lives near the plant and sits on two citizen advisory
boards that oversee the cleanup.

"I don't want to play Chinese checkers with this stuff, but it's got to
go somewhere," she said.

The material already has been removed from the silos and placed in four,
750,000-gallon metal storage tanks, which are housed in a concrete
building at the site. The process of removing the waste from those
tanks, mixing it with ash and concrete and pouring the mixture into
concrete moving crates should begin May 9, project manager Dennis Carr
said.

"The first shipment should go out the last week of May," Carr said.
"This gives us the last piece of the puzzle, and allows us to have a
clear path for completion of the project."

The 5,000 storage containers will be shipped on flatbed trucks to Texas,
two at a time.

In its day, Fernald was a top-secret operation that produced about 500
million pounds of high-quality uranium for the country's nuclear weapons
program. The uranium was extracted from raw ore by placing it in a
series of acid baths, shedding 10 pounds of metallic waste for every
pound of uranium it produced. Much of that waste ended up in the silos.

And that waste has been a vexing issue for the government since the
cleanup began. The original plan was to encase the waste in glass - a
process known as vitrification. That plan was abandoned as not
technically feasible after more than $69 million of taxpayer cash was
spent. The plan then switched to removing the waste and encasing it in
concrete - and the problems switched from technical to geographical.

A facility in Utah was to receive the silos' waste, until that plan was
abandoned because of citizen protest. The government then wanted to ship
the material by rail to the Nevada desert, until the governor there
threatened a federal lawsuit last April. That has left the silos waste
with no place to go for the past year - until Thursday.

In Texas, the Sierra Club has objected to the material being stored in
Andrews, but a series of public hearings have been held on the subject
with no other opposition. Also, the facility is licensed to store the
material, which would make a legal challenge difficult.

"Issuing the contract, in and of itself, is not the holy grail," said
Tom Schneider, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency representative
at Fernald. "But getting the silos waste off site is considered that.
We'll all be relieved when we get that stuff out, and this is an
essential step to achieve that."

Highlights Wednesday from the Texas Legislature

Associated Press

AUSTIN - A company that recently won a $7.5 million contract to store
tons of uranium byproduct in Texas would have to pay a fee to dispose of
the radioactive waste under legislation the Senate approved Wednesday.

The move follows an announcement last week that the waste will come to a
site operated by Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists in Andrews
County, near the Texas-New Mexico border.

Waste Control Specialists has a license to store the waste but the
company also has a state application pending to dispose of the waste.

If the application is granted, the bill by Sen. Robert Duncan,
R-Lubbock, says the company would pay the state 8 percent of its gross
receipts from its operations under the disposal license. Andrews County
will receive 2 percent of the gross receipts.

Know Before We Glow: Nuclear waste site invites questions
Dallas Morning News (subscription), TX - May 2, 2005
12:10 AM CDT on Tuesday, May 3, 2005

Forgive us if we get a bit technical here:

Whoa!

That seems to be the only rational response to the news that a site in
West Texas was designated as the repository for 3,500 truckloads of
radioactive bomb waste and Ð simultaneously Ð federal regulators
declared the state virtually incompetent to monitor such facilities. To
quote the exact words of Nuclear Regulatory Commission overseers, Texas
is "in jeopardy of not being able to fulfill its responsibility to
protect public health and safety."

Yikes!

The waste, from a decommissioned bomb factory in Ohio, is the property
of the federal Department of Energy. And who ultimately controls where
it can be disposed? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Double yikes!

Maybe in the super-arcane world of government regulation, there's some
way this all fits together. But we live out here in the real world, and
before we see those truckloads of uranium goo wheeling through Dallas on
Interstate 20, we'd like for someone to sit us down and explain to us in
very plain English why we shouldn't be worried.

Andrews County, where the stuff is headed, sees the waste facility,
owned by Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists, as a badly needed boost
to the local economy. The state Ð in the person of state Sen. Robert
Duncan of Lubbock Ð is looking to get in on the economic action by
imposing a tax on disposal of nuclear materials. Mr. Duncan's bill would
also consolidate the state's oversight role in the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. (It's now split between TCEQ and the Texas
Department of State Health Services, the agency the NRC found unequal to
the task.)

Mr. Duncan may have charted the correct course, but at this point we're
more interested in a resolution by Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine that
would create a joint legislative committee to study the risks associated
with such facilities Ð including, presumably, the resources needed to
provide adequate oversight.

The Legislature approved creation of the Andrews County dump two years
ago, with assurances that Texans would not be endangered. Unless
legislators act responsibly now, those promises will ring awfully
hollow.

Ship Fernald waste safely away
Editorials

Federal officials finally have found a place willing to take Fernald's
most dangerous radioactive waste - all 10,000 tons that have been stored
for decades at the former top-secret nuclear weapons processing plant
northwest of Cincinnati.

Although Fernald's $4.4 billion Superfund cleanup is one of the biggest
in the Midwest, three previous deals to ship the toxic waste out West
have collapsed. Thursday, the Department of Energy unstuck the project
by awarding a contract to a disposal operator in President Bush's home
state of Texas. Suddenly there's a way forward. All parties should take
every precaution to make sure nothing goes wrong this time in shipping
the radioactive material out of our region for keeps.

Waste Control Specialists of Dallas not only contracted to store the
waste outside the small West Texas town of Andrews, but the company also
applied to permanently dispose of Fernald waste at that site. That
license won't be decided for about a year, but regardless, once the
waste is trucked out of Ohio, federal rules would keep it from ever
returning. Shipping the waste in 5,000 concrete storage containers, two
at a time on flatbed trucks, could start this month and be finished by
December.

During the Cold War, Fernald produced about 500 million pounds of
weapons-grade uranium for U.S. nuclear bombs. Radioactive byproducts
were stored in on-site silos. In 1993, the Energy Department decided to
encase the waste in glass in a process known as vitrification, but one
test plant and $69 million later, the project was scrapped. Utah balked
at accepting the waste at a site there, and in April 2004, Nevada's
attorney general threatened a federal lawsuit if cleanup contractor
Fluor Fernald tried to ship the silo waste to the Nevada Test Site about
65 miles outside Las Vegas. Now, in a reversal of the familiar NIMBY
outcry - not in my back yard - jobs-poor Andrews residents and city
officials have generally welcomed the waste in the hopes of it bringing
spinoff industries. Environmentalists and some ranchers have objected.

Part of the Fernald cleanup involved decontaminating the aquifer beneath
the site. Opponents around Andrews object that Ohio's waste, in the
event of an earthquake, could threaten their aquifers.

By contrast, Kentucky residents and officials near the Blue Grass Army
Depot outside Richmond didn't want tons of stored chemical weapons
shipped off-site. Late last month, the Pentagon reversed itself and
agreed to release about $300 million to build a plant at Blue Grass to
destroy the toxic chemicals such as VX and sarin nerve gas.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's vision for Fernald's 1,050
acres is to turn it into wetlands, prairies and forest much like it must
have been before Europeans settled the land. An educational center will
explain the plant's role in building the nation's nuclear arsenal and
inflicting grievous damage on the environment. Fernald's neighbors
deserve to see that Cold War waste at last safely trucked away.

Debris from razed nuke plants could come to West Texas

BETSY BLANEY

Associated Press

Federal regulators will soon decide whether tons of rubble from two
closed nuclear power plants in the northeast will come to West Texas for
disposal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was expected within a month to approve
requests from two privately owned utility companies to send Waste
Control Specialists tens of millions of pounds of low-level radioactive
debris from demolished plants in Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Dallas-based Waste Control last week won a two-year $7.5 million
contract to store higher-level nuclear material - uranium byproduct
waste - from an abandoned nuclear weapons processing plant in Ohio at
the company's Andrews County site in West Texas.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman David McIntrye said the material
from the northeast shouldn't be confused with the Ohio waste.

"It is definitely low-level stuff," McIntrye said. "This is more
construction rubble."

Waste Control has a license to permanently dispose of safer hazardous
waste but doesn't have the same state clearance with low- and high-level
radioactive material. The company can only temporarily store radioactive
waste and has applications for permanent disposal pending with the
state.

According to an NRC draft of an environmental assessment at the
Massachusetts site, the radioactive material in the debris is safe
enough that it can go to a hazardous waste site, said Susan Jablonski,
spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on Environment Quality.

A favorable ruling will clear the way for Waste Control to dispose of
the material, company president George Dials said. But Texas officials
aren't so sure.

"Our question is under what authority are you granting an exemption from
Texas rules," Jablonski said.

In a letter dated April 26, officials with the Texas commission told the
NRC that nothing in state law or in the company's current radioactive
waste permits allows for disposal of the debris without state approval.

Federal approval of one plant's request to send 84 million pounds of
plant rubble from Massachusetts to Waste Control is expected within two
weeks, McIntyre said. The request from the Connecticut plant involves
100 million tons of debris and is about 30 days from approval, he said.

Though the commission already has approved an alternative plan to send
the Connecticut debris to an Idaho facility, Waste Control still could
get it, McIntyre said.

Transportation of the uranium byproduct waste from the Ohio plant could
begin by the end of the month and finish by year's end.

Washington Times

Making money off waste

ANDREWS, Texas (AP) -- This small West Texas town developed its economy
on oil but may hang its hopes on what some folks say is their next boom:
storage and disposal of radioactive waste.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists owns 14,400 acres about 30 miles
outside town near the New Mexico border. About 1,340 acres have been set
aside for hazardous waste storage and disposal, and the company will
manage tons of federal uranium byproduct waste by year's end.

Rather than a "not in my backyard" stance, some residents say the waste
site will generate dozens of jobs from spinoff industries, and city
leaders anticipate it will pump millions into the economy.

"If we thought we could get an NFL franchise or a river walk, we
wouldn't have looked at this industry," said Russell Shannon, vice
president of the Andrews Industrial Foundation. "We just believe it will
bring us some jobs, bring people to our community to get involved in an
industry, like they did with oil."

Andrews was incorporated in 1937, about eight years after oil was
struck. By 1956, the county led the nation in oil production, pumping
more than 60 million barrels annually.

The oil boom lasted through the 1960s, fell off and then picked up
again. Gradually, the oil business dwindled, along with the town's
population. In the late 1990s, Andrews hit another national high, this
time with double-digit unemployment, as oil prices sunk to $8 per
barrel.

Many hope the radioactive waste site can turn around Andrews' fortunes.
Residents recently learned that it was tapped to store tons of uranium
byproduct waste now at the abandoned Fernald federal plant, just
northwest of Cincinnati. Shipments could begin later this month.

The Ohio plant processed and purified uranium metal for use in reactors
to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons from the 1950s until 1989.

Waste Control Specialists has an application pending with the Texas
Department of State Health Services to dispose of the waste. A decision
could come early next year.

If approved, some lawmakers want the state to profit from the transfer.
However, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, a Democrat, has introduced a bill
to limit radioactive waste storage and disposal in Texas.

Waste Control Specialists has stored, treated and disposed of hazardous
waste at the Andrews site since 1997. Earlier this year, the state
approved the company's request to expand the storage capacity to 1.5
million cubic feet -- nearly five times its current size -- making it
eligible to accept the Ohio waste. The space is the equivalent of about
800 railroad cars.

More radioactive material comes to Texas
5/4/2005 9:17 AM
By: Associated Press

Regulators will soon decide whether tons of rubble from two closed
nuclear power plants in the northeast will head to West Texas for
disposal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected, within one month, to
approve requests from two privately owned utilities.

The companies want to send Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists tens
of millions of pounds of low-level radioactive debris.

The rubble would come from demolished plants in Massachusetts and
Connecticut.

Waste Control last week won a two-year contract to store higher-level
nuclear material from an old weapons processing plant in Ohio -- at the
company's Andrews County site.

NRC spokesman David McIntrye said the material from the northeast
shouldn't be confused with the Ohio waste.

The Connecticut and Massachusetts debris is definitely low-level stuff,
what he called construction rubble,

Senate OKs nuclear-waste fee
Some question enhancing state's reputation as a dumping ground
By JEFFREY GILBERT
Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau

RESOURCES
AUSTIN - The Senate passed a measure Wednesday that could bring several
million dollars in revenue to the state by charging a fee for the
disposal of certain low-level nuclear waste, including a load that is
set to come to West Texas in the next few weeks.

About 3,500 truckloads of the radioactive material, made mostly of
uranium mill tailings, will be moved from a nuclear bomb materials plant
in Ohio to Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists' facility in Andrews
County, it was announced last week. The uranium waste is not necessarily
any more radioactive than the low-level waste the company stores now.

Under current law, the state wouldn't receive any compensation for the
disposal of the uranium waste, but the bill, sponsored by Sen. Robert
Duncan, R-Lubbock, calls for the state to receive 8 percent and the host
county to receive 2 percent of any gross receipts.

Lt. Gov David Dewhurst said the goal of Senate Bill 1667 is "to balance
the needs for disposal of certain waste around the state from medical
(facilities) for a safe environment and at the same time to protect the
people of Texas."

Though it has a license to store the uranium waste, Waste Control
doesn't have a permit to dispose of it. That application is pending.

The bill also transfers jurisdiction of the disposal of all radioactive
waste, excluding some oil and gas materials, to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.

Duncan said that agency can regulate this waste better than the Texas
Department of State Health Services.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said last week that the state health
department is under scrutiny because deadlines have been missed and
inspections were overdue.

Environmentalists and some lawmakers are worried that Texas will become
the one and only dumping ground for this type of radioactive waste
because it is the only state that accepts it.

Several other states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas, have
already asked about shipping some of their radioactive waste to Texas,
said Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso.

"Do we want to be the state that is the repository for all these other
states?" he asked.

At this point, Duncan conceded that Texas is headed in that direction,
but said he didn't want to "fight the battle and lose the war." It is
time to focus the state's efforts on making sure this is regulated the
right way, he said.

"We will be the state of first and last resort because we're the only
one doing this," Duncan said.

Radioactive waste

A company that recently won a $7.5 million contract to store tons of
uranium byproduct in West Texas would have to pay a fee to dispose of
the radioactive waste under legislation the Senate approved and sent to
the House on Wednesday.

The move follows an announcement last week that the waste will be sent
to a site operated by Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists in Andrews
County, near the New Mexico border. The waste would fill the equivalent
of up to 800 railroad cars. It's now at a government plant in Ohio.

The Energy Department still owns the waste, which will remain at the
Andrews County site for two years while the department looks for a
long-term storage or disposal arrangement. Waste Control Specialists has
a license to store the waste, and the company has a state application
pending to dispose of it.

If the application is granted, the bill by Sen. Robert Duncan,
R-Lubbock, says that Waste Control Specialists would pay the state 8
percent of its gross receipts from its operations under the disposal
license. Andrews County will receive 2 percent of the gross receipts.

Duncan's bill would give the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
jurisdiction over the disposal of most radioactive waste. The Texas
Department of State Health Services has jurisdiction now, but Duncan
said the environmental commission has more expertise on the issue.

Texas Senate OKs tax on incoming shipments of radioactive waste
 
May 5 -- The Texas Senate passed a bill May 4 that would allow the state
to tax certain types of radioactive waste shipped into Texas for
disposal.

The legislation was in response to a bill passed by the U.S. Congress
that reclassified tons of waste located at a former Energy Department
uranium processing facility at Fernald, Ohio, near Cincinnati. Congress«
action makes the waste eligible for storage at low-level radioactive
waste disposal sites across the nation, including one in Andrews County,
Texas.

The material, 11-E2 waste, is a byproduct of the mining and refining of
uranium for use in nuclear weapons.

Texas Senate Bill 1667 would allow the state to charge 10 percent of the
contract fee paid to a company to dispose of 11-E2 waste in Texas.
Eighty percent of the tax collected would go to the state«s general
revenue fund and the remaining 20 percent would go to Andrews County.

Waste Control Specialists, located in Andrews County, announced last
month that it had been awarded a contract to store at least some of the
radioactive waste from Ohio. The company also has applied for an
application that would allow for permanent disposal of the waste at its
facility.

The bill approved by the Senate also would transfer responsibility for
overseeing transport and storage of radioactive waste in the state from
the Department of State Health Services to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.

The bill would need House approval and the signature of the governor before 
becoming law.

 Senate approves disposal fee for radioactive waste
Associated Press
05/05/2005

AUSTIN -- A company that recently won a $7.5 million contract to store
tons of uranium byproduct in Texas would have to pay a fee to dispose of
the radioactive waste under legislation the Senate approved Wednesday.

The move follows an announcement last week that the waste will come to a
site operated by Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists in Andrews
County, near the Texas-New Mexico border.

The waste would fill the equivalent of up to 800 railroad cars. It's now
at a government plant in Ohio.

The Department of Energy still owns the waste, which will remain at the
Andrews County site for two years as the DOE looks for a long-term
storage or disposal arrangement.

Waste Control Specialists has a license to store the waste, and the
company has a state application pending to dispose of the waste.

If the application is granted, the bill by Sen. Robert Duncan,
R-Lubbock, says that Waste Control Specialists would pay the state 8
percent of its gross receipts from its operations under the disposal
license. Andrews County will receive 2 percent of the gross receipts.

Waste Control also is seeking a separate state license from the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality to dispose of low-level radioactive
waste. That would include contaminated clothing or tools, most from
commercial nuclear plants.

Currently, the company can treat and store the waste but must send it
elsewhere for disposal.

Duncan's bill would give the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
jurisdiction over most radioactive waste. The Texas Department of State
Health Services has jurisdiction over some of the waste now, but Duncan
said the TCEQ has more expertise on the issue.

"The number one reason for the bill is to get the regulatory
jurisdiction to the right agency so if this is going to happen, that
it's regulated by the proper agency," Duncan said.

Federal officials that regulate nuclear issues last week placed the
health services department on "heightened oversight" and gave it 30 days
to submit an improvement plan. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited
concerns of late radiation inspections and reporting due to staff
shortages and jobs left vacant for months.

NUCLEAR WASTE
More regulation, money sought

A bill that would give state environmental regulators jurisdiction over
the disposal of almost all radioactive waste in Texas was approved
Wednesday by the Senate. The bill was hailed as a significant step in
overcoming Texas' growing reputation as a nuclear dumping ground.

The measure also would allow the state to levy a new fee on companies
that deal in radioactive waste, potentially generating millions of
dollars.

The move follows an announcement last week that nuclear waste from an
Ohio plant is bound for Andrews County.

"Whether you're for this or against it, we're already getting it," said
Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, the author of Senate Bill 1667. "The
number one priority we had with this legislation was to improve how we
regulate this process."

Under the bill, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality gets
jurisdiction over the disposal of all levels of radioactive waste,
except oil and gas waste. The commission currently regulates low-level
waste, and the Department of State Health Services regulates other
forms.

Last week, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission admonished the
health services agency for its regulatory supervision and put it on
"heightened oversight."

Former oil town hopes to become vast wasteland
Andrews sees radioactive trash as a source of economic rebirth, but some worry
By BETSY BLANEY
Associated Press

Odessa American File

Tom Jones III, general manager of Waste Control Specialists, surveys the
800,000-cubic-yard hazardous waste landfill near Andrews in January.
Tons of uranium waste are headed to the site from Cincinnati.

ANDREWS - This small West Texas town grew its economy on oil but may
hang its hopes on what some folks think is their next boom: storage and
disposal of radioactive waste.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists owns 14,400 acres about 30 miles
outside town near the New Mexico border. About 1,340 acres are set aside
for hazardous waste storage and disposal, and the company will manage
tons of federal uranium byproduct waste by year's end.

Some residents think the site will bring dozens of jobs from spin-off
industries, and city leaders anticipate it will pump millions of dollars
into the economy. It's a reverse NIMBY  not in my back yard  with
Andrews welcoming the radioactive waste rather than fighting to keep it
out.

"If we thought we could get an NFL franchise or a Riverwalk, we wouldn't
have looked at this industry," said Russell Shannon, vice president of
the Andrews Industrial Foundation, a privately funded group formed
decades ago to help attract companies to the town. "We just believe it
will bring us some jobs, bring people to our community to get involved
in an industry, like they did with oil."

Oil business dried up
The town was incorporated in 1937, about eight years after oil was
struck in Andrews County. By 1956, the county led the nation in oil
production, pumping 60 million barrels annually.

The oil boom lasted through the 1960s, fell off and then picked up again
in the early 1980s. But gradually the oil business dwindled, along with
the town's population. In the late 1990s, Andrews hit another national
high, this time with double-digit unemployment, as oil prices sank to $8
a barrel.

Residents hope the waste site will turn around Andrews' fortunes.
Thursday, they learned the site will become the storage destination for
tons of Department of Energy uranium byproduct waste from the abandoned
Fernald federal plant, just northwest of Cincinnati.

Shipments from Fernald could begin as early as late May and probably
will be completed by year's end.

The Fernald plant processed and purified uranium metal for use in
reactors to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons from the 1950s until
it ended production in 1989.

Waste Control Specialists has an application pending with the Texas
Department of State Health Services to dispose of the uranium byproduct
waste. A decision could come early next year.

State poised to profit
If approved, some lawmakers want the state to profit.

Last week, the Senate approved a bill by Sen. Robert Duncan, a Lubbock
Republican, that would give the state 8 percent of gross receipts for
waste storage, processing and disposal, plus a surcharge based on the
level of radioactivity.

The bill now goes to the House.

The money would come from Waste Control, the only company to apply for
Texas permits to handle the radioactive waste.

However, Rep. Mike Villarreal, a San Antonio Democrat, has introduced a
bill to limit radioactive waste storage and disposal in Texas.

A bill passed by legislators in 2003 allowed for low-level waste from
Vermont to come to the state. Villarreal's measure would prohibit other
states from approaching Texas about taking their radioactive waste.

Waste Control has stored, treated and disposed of hazardous waste at the
Andrews site since 1997.

In February, the state approved the company's request to expand the
storage capacity to 1.5 million cubic feet  nearly five times its
current size  making it eligible to accept the Ohio waste. The
expansion space is the equivalent of about 800 railroad cars.

George Dials, president and chief executive officer for Waste Control,
said the expansion was necessary for the company's long-term plans to
assist federal plants with site cleanup and disposal of low-level waste.

Andrews appeared to have little competition for the Fernald waste.
Nevada officials threatened a lawsuit if the DOE sent the waste to a
government-run site north of Las Vegas. Residents near a private waste
site in Clive, Utah  west of Salt Lake City  also rejected it.

While the legislative and administrative wrangling in Texas continues,
environmentalists worry about how the waste will affect the air, soil
and water.

An 800-foot-deep layer of red clay rises to near the surface at the
site, which Andrews leaders and company officials say makes the site
geologically sound.

But Melanie Barnes, a geology researcher at Texas Tech University and
chairwoman of the League of Women Voters of Texas' hazardous waste
program, said surface fractures exist and she's unsure how deep they go.
A major concern is that if the waste seeps through the soil, it could
affect the Santa Rosa and Ogallala aquifers.

The Ogallala is a primary source of drinking water in West Texas, and at
least one ranch near the waste site uses the Santa Rosa to provide water
for livestock.

"I believe that the long-term storage and/or disposal of radioactive
material at this site is extremely dangerous for the health and well
being of future generations," rancher John Post wrote to state Rep.
Buddy West, R-Odessa. Post, whose 18,000-acre ranch is 11 miles from the
waste site, fears his land will be useless if the Santa Rosa becomes
polluted.

Other townspeople oppose the site, but they're in the minority. Peggy
Pryor, 54, has lived in Andrews most of her life. She says she thinks no
good can come from any type of radioactive waste.

"It's all about money and how much money they can make, and it's not
about the environment at all," Pryor said.

Dials said the clay is impermeable to water. "By and large there are no
fractures that lead anywhere, and we're confident in the design," he
said. "We feel it will be safely contained and isolated from the
biosphere for tens of thousands of years."

Cyrus Reed, a registered lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said waste sites
with clay beds in Maxey Flats, Ky., and West Valley, N.Y. were touted as
impermeable, too.

Contaminated groundwater was found at each years after they opened.

"The point is there were previous sites where people had made
predictions that they were good sites and there would be no problems,
and there were problems," he said.

The national environmental group has requested a hearing before the
Texas Department of State Health Services to contest the state's
decision to allow Waste Control to expand its Andrews site. No hearing
date has been set.

Cold War waste bound for Texas

Web Posted: 05/20/2005 12:00 AM CDT

Betsy Blaney
Associated Press

LUBBOCK Ñ Trucks toting tons of Cold War-era
uranium byproduct waste from a shuttered
government plant in Ohio will begin their
1,300-mile journey to Texas this month.

The Ohio plant processed and purified uranium
metal for use in reactors to produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons from the 1950s until 1989. The
waste will be transported to a site near the
Texas-New Mexico border in about 5,000 large,
sealed containers filled with a concrete mixture.

The material doesn't pose a great risk to humans,
said Jeff Wagner, a spokesman for Fluor Fernald,
the U.S. Energy Department contractor cleaning up
the shuttered plant just outside Cincinnati.

Should an accident occur, first responders would
deal with it like a hazardous materials spill, he
said.

"From a radiation standpoint, it's not going to
kill people," Wagner said, adding that there are
"far greater risks" from chemicals, gasoline and
acids being carried on the nation's roadways.

Visionary Solutions LLC, an Oak Ridge, Tenn.-based
company, will transport the radioactive waste, but
Fernald is responsible for preparing the material
before it's loaded onto flatbed trucks.

In 1998, Energy Department inspectors reported
that Fernald failed to provide strong, tight
containers and proper supervision for the waste
transport program when moving radioactive waste to
the Nevada Test Site just outside Las Vegas. The
report came after leaks developed in the
containers in 1997. No contamination occurred, but
shipments stopped for 18 months.

Since then, the shipping containers have been
redesigned, quality control is more rigorous and
there is more focus on transport issues, Wagner
said.

But in March 2002, 70 mph winds just outside
Laramie, Wyo., blew over a Fernald truck that
carried two one-liter padded containers of a
liquid solution of plutonium and neptunium. The
material, which is used for calibrating
instruments and analyzing samples that might
contain radioactive materials, was going to the
Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
Laboratory near Idaho Falls. No radioactivity was
released.

Environmentalists say such incidents show the
risks involved.

"The evidence out there is that just like any
shipments, there's potential for accidents,"
Sierra Club spokesman Cyrus Reed said. "This
material is so long-lasting, and the results
aren't necessarily imminent but they're more
chronic in nature."

At least two Texas-bound trucks will leave Ohio
the week of May 30, Wagner said. The trip will
take two to four days. Each truck is designed to
carry two containers weighing an average of 20,000
pounds, and they'll be tracked by global
positioning satellites. Trucks will make trips to
Texas through the end of the year.

The route was chosen for travel time, distance and
population along the way to minimize the risk,
Wagner said. The trucks primarily will use
interstates and avoid big cities by using highway
bypasses.

The trucks will enter Texas on Interstate 40 and
travel through Amarillo and Lubbock to get to the
site in Andrews, just north of Odessa.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists won a $7.5
million contract from Fernald in late April to
store the waste Ñ two months after state officials
granted the company a license amendment that
expanded the site's storage capacity to nearly
five times its current size.

Alleged anti-Castro terrorist Posada arrested
Wanted in Venezuela for 1976 downing of Cuban airliner

From Susan Candiotti
CNN
Wednesday, May 18, 2005 Posted: 0136 GMT (0936 HKT)

MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Federal agents arrested
notorious Cuban exile leader Luis Posada Carriles
near Miami Tuesday afternoon. He is reported to
have been planning to leave the country.

Posada was legendary among south Florida's Cuban
exile community for his plots to kill Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.

He is wanted in Venezuela to face charges that he
blew up a Cuban airliner in 1976, killing 73
people.

Castro has called Posada a terrorist and a monster
and even staged a rally early Tuesday outside the
U.S. Mission in Havana to demand his arrest. (Full
story)

Posada, a onetime CIA operative, had been in
hiding since he was smuggled into the United
States via Mexico.

He had been seeking asylum in the United States,
but told CNN earlier Tuesday he might withdraw
that request because of the furor surrounding his
presence in Miami.

Posada was seized near Miami by agents from the
Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and
Customs Enforcement agency.

Santiago Alvarez, who had helped pay Posada's
legal bills during his bid to remain in the United
States, said agents picked up Posada as he was
planning to leave the country.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez -- a Castro ally
-- has demanded the United States extradite Posada
to face charges in the airliner bombing.

Posada adamantly denies any role in the attack. He
was jailed for nine years in Venezuela, but he was
never convicted and escaped in 1985.

The Associated Press reported he also served as a
senior officer of the Venezuelan intelligence
service and holds citizenship there.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Venezuelan authorities had asked the
federal government to arrest Posada and the
request was referred to the Justice Department.

Posada said he was smuggled over the Mexican
border into Texas and came by bus to South
Florida.

He said he had been hiding but that in recent
weeks people in Miami had begun to recognize him.

Posada's presence in the United States has
presented a problem for U.S. officials, who want
to support anti-Castro Cubans but are sensitive to
terrorist charges against Posada.

Posada said he has not renounced violence, but
declared, "I am not a terrorist."

When asked about Havana hotel bombings in 1997
that killed one Italian tourist, however, he
refused to take any questions or make any comment.

Now in his late 70s, Posada was convicted in
Panama of plotting with three Cuban exiles to kill
Castro during a visit to Panama in 2000.

He later received a presidential pardon and has
surfaced in Guatemala and Mexico before heading to
the United States.

Asked if he would still like to kill Castro,
Posada said, "He's rotting away."

The Homeland Security Department issued a
statement after Posada's arrest that said the
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has 48
hours to rule on his immigration status.

"As a matter of immigration law and policy, ICE
does not generally remove people to Cuba, nor does
ICE generally remove people to countries believed
to be acting on Cuba's behalf," the statement
said.

Posada received CIA training in explosives and
sabotage at Fort Benning, Georgia, after helping
to organize the failed Bay of Pigs operation to
oust Castro in 1961.

He said he stopped working for the CIA in 1968 but
in the 1980s helped the U.S.-backed secret Contra
supply network in Central America.

A senior official familiar with Posada's career
said the CIA considers him "radioactive" and said
he is no longer linked to the agency.

CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.

Radioactive waste from Ohio begins its journey to Texas

LUBBOCK, Texas - Trucks toting tons of Cold
War-era uranium byproduct waste from a shuttered
government plant in Ohio will begin their
1,300-mile journey to Texas this month.

The Ohio plant processed and purified uranium
metal for use in reactors to produce plutonium for

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists won a $7.5
million contract from Fernald in late April to
store the waste - two months after state officials
granted the company a license amendment that
expanded the site's storage capacity to 1.5
million cubic feet - nearly five times its current
size - making it eligible to accept the Ohio
waste.

The Sierra Club has requested a hearing to contest
the license change. A hearing before an
administrative judge in Austin is set for July 11.

Waste Control also seeks a license to dispose of
the Ohio waste. Without the license, the waste can
remain at the Texas site for only two years.

Compact still looking for nuclear waste disposal site
Monday May 30, 2005
BY ALGIS J. LAUKAITIS / Lincoln Journal Star

Texas is still in the cards, but the chairperson
of the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Commission says the group is also looking
elsewhere for a place to store the compact's
nuclear waste.

"We're focusing on a couple of other options.
We're looking at private companies, as well as
Texas," said Laura Gilson, who heads the
commission and represents the state of Arkansas.

Gilson declined to name the companies but said
they are outside of the compact region, made up of
Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.

"We're negotiating with private companies to get
the best possible price and secure a site for our
compact," Gilson said in a phone interview.

A presentation on the compact's efforts to find a
site will be made at its annual meeting on June 29
at the Sheraton Hotel, 1615 Howard St. in Omaha.

The state of Nebraska, whose membership in the
compact ended almost a year ago, has been helping
the commission in its negotiations with Texas and
private companies.

Nebraska's cooperation was part of an agreement to
end years of lawsuits and disputes between the
commission and the state of Nebraska over the
failed siting of a proposed low-level radioactive
waste storehouse in Boyd County.

In 2002, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Kopf
ruled former Gov. Ben Nelson acted in "bad faith"
and blocked efforts to build the nuclear waste
site.

After months of negotiations, state officials
agreed to pay the commission millions of dollars
to settle the case. The Legislature recently
approved a two-year budget that includes paying
the $145.8 million in one lump sum.

Nebraska also agreed to assist the commission for
nine months in finding long-term storage for the
low-level radioactive waste generated within the
compact region, as well as Nebraska. Those nine
months ended May 1.

"We're still continuing to work with the compact
commission exploring our various options," said
David Cookson, special counsel for the Attorney
General's Office.

Cookson declined to discuss details of the ongoing
negotiations with Texas or private companies.

When asked if Nebraska will continue to be
involved in negotiations even though the
nine-month period has expired, Cookson replied:
"It's my understanding we will continue to work
together as long as we feel it's in our
interests."

The commission is negotiating with the Texas
compact to accept low-level radioactive waste. The
state of Texas is in a compact with Vermont,
however no commissioners have been appointed yet.

A Dallas company, Waste Control Specialists, has
applied for a license to build a storage site for
low-level waste in Andrews County in west Texas.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is
conducting a technical review of the application,
which will take about 15 months, said Susan
Jablonski, a radioactive waste specialist for the
agency.

She said a decision on the application will be
made in 2007.

Jablonski said she had no information about
ongoing negotiations between the state of Texas
and Central compact or Nebraska officials.

Gilson said Nebraska has been actively involved in
the negotiations. But she was uncertain whether
Nebraska would have access to a site if one is
found outside of the compact region.

"We are negotiating with Nebraska according to our
settlement agreement," Gilson said. "Beyond that,
Nebraska is a non-compact state. They would have
to find their own place."

Most of Nebraska's low-level radioactive waste is
generated by its two nuclear power plants, Cooper
Nuclear Station near Brownville and Fort Calhoun
Station north of Omaha. The waste is made up of
mostly tools, clothing and resins used in daily
operations. Much of it is stored on-site until it
can be shipped out of state.

The Nebraska Public Power District, which owns and
operates Cooper, shipped 2,437 cubic feet of
low-level radioactive waste to storage sites in
Barnwell, S.C., and Clive, Utah, in 2004. Those
sites are owned by private companies.

NPPD spokeswoman Jeanne Schieffer said the utility
is aware of the negotiations but "we have not
heard of any solutions at this point."

Mike Jones, a spokesman for the the Omaha Public
Power District, which owns Fort Calhoun, said the
utility has not been directly involved in
negotiations but has been kept up-to-date.

Last year, OPPD shipped about 1,500 cubic feet of
low-level radioactive waste, mostly to Barnwell,
S.C.

Depleted Uranium: A Scientific Perspective
 	
An Interview With LEUREN MORET, Geoscientist

Interview Conducted By W. Leon Smith and Nathan Diebenow

Leuren Moret is a geoscientist who works almost
around the clock educating citizens, the media,
members of parliaments and Congress and other
officials on radiation issues. She became a
whistleblower in 1991 at the Livermore Nuclear
Weapons Lab after witnessing fraud on the Yucca
Mountain Project. She is currently working as an
independent citizen scientist and radiation
specialist in communities around the world, and
contributed to the U.N. subcommission
investigating depleted uranium. According to
Wikipedia online encyclopedia, Moret testified at
the International Criminal Tribunal for
Afghanistan in Japan in 2003, presented at the
World Depleted Uranium Weapons Conference in
Hamburg, Germany, and spoke at the World Court of
Women at the World Social Forum in Bombay, India,
in January 2004.

THE INTERVIEW

ICONOCLAST: What are the latest developments with
reducing depleted uranium exposures on U.S.
troops?

MORET: A young veteran named Melissa Sterry of
Connecticut has introduced a bill into the
Connecticut Legislature requiring independent
testing of returning Afghan and Gulf War veterans
going back to 2001. She said that she did it
because she's sick, and her friends are dead, and
that's from serving in the 2003 conflict. I have
been following the bill and talking to her.
Yesterday, she testified twice at the United
Nations. I said, "Why don't we get this bill all
over the U.S. in state legislatures because it
informs the public and get the local media to
cover it." The U.S. has blocked any accountability
at international and national levels. There's a
total cover-up just like with Agent Orange, the
atomic veterans, MKULTRA, the mind control
experiments the CIA did. This is more of the same,
but the issue is much, much worse because the
genetic future of all those contaminated is
effected. Now vast regions around our world, as
well as our atmosphere, are contaminated with the
depleted uranium. They've used so much. It's the
equivalent number of atoms, as the Japanese
professor calculated it, to over 400,000 Nagasaki
bombs that has been released into the atmosphere.
That's really an underestimate.

I went to Louisiana in April. I was invited to
speak at the University of New Orleans for three
days. One of the veterans asked me to be in their
April 19 protest and rally through the City of New
Orleans. He took the Connecticut bill straight to
the Legislature, and he got two legislators to
sponsor it, and he said, "Just whiteout the name
'Connecticut' and write in 'Louisiana' on the
bill." You're not going to believe it. It passed
101 to 0 yesterday in the Louisiana House.

I want you to write about it because we want it
(the DU testing bill) in Texas. Nevada is going to
introduce it. Congressman Jim McDermott is going
to put it into the Washington legislature. We want
to get the governor of Montana to do it because
he's the first governor to demand his National
Guard be returned. I think half of them are back.
He said, "I need them in the state." The DU issue
is just really, really, really, really so awful. I
don't think there's any greater tragedy in the
history of the world in what they've done.

ICONOCLAST: Is there a danger of depleted uranium,
being used in weaponry over there, spreading by
air over here?

MORET: The atmosphere globally is contaminated
with it. It's completely mixed in one year. I'm an
expert on atmospheric dust. I'm a geoscientist, a
geologist, and that's what I studied and did my
research on. It's really a fascinating subject. We
have huge dust storms that are a million square
miles and transport millions of tons of dust and
sand every year around the world. The main centers
of these dust storms are the Gobi Desert in China,
which is where the Chinese did atmospheric
testing, so that's all contaminated with
radiation, and it gets transported right over
Japan, and it comes straight across the Pacific
and dumps all its sand and dust on the U.S., North
America. It's loaded with radioactive isotopes,
soot, pesticides, chemicals, pollution --
everything is in it -- fungi, bacteria, viruses.

The Sahara Desert is another huge dust center, and
it goes up all over Europe and straight across the
Atlantic, to the Caribbean, and up the East Coast.
Of course, you get it in Texas with those
hurricanes. They all originate in the Sahara
Desert.

The third region is the Western United States,
which is where the Nevada test site is located. We
did 1,200 nuclear weapons tests there, so all this
radiation that is already there, which is bad
enough, has caused a global cancer epidemic since
1945. All of that radiation was the equivalent of
40,000 Nagasaki bombs. We're talking about 10
times more.

In April of 2003, the World Health Organization
said they expect global cancer rates to increase
50 percent by the year 2020.

Infant mortality is going up again all over the
world. This is an indicator of the level of
radioactive pollution.

When the U.S. and Russia signed the partial test
ban treaty in 1963, the infant mortality rate
started dropping again, which is normal. Now they
are going up again. It's the global pollution with
this radiation.

ICONOCLAST: I had one of our correspondents send
me a series of photographs of the Al-Asad dust
storm in Iraq on April 28.

MORET: That dust is what I'm talking about.

ICONOCLAST: In the picture you can see a gigantic
wall of sand.

MORET: I have 16 pictures of that storm. They're
posted with photos from Iraqi doctors of the
children of people with cancer and leukemia. So
what did you think of that dust storm?

ICONOCLAST: I thought it was really dramatic.

MORET: It remobilizes all the radiation, but those
are the larger chunks. The DU burns at such high
temperatures. It's a pyroforic metal which means
it burns. The bullets and big caliber shells are
actually on fire when they come out of the gun
barrel because they are ignited by the friction in
the gun barrel. Seventy percent of the DU metal
becomes a metal vapor. It's actually a radioactive
gas weapon and a terrain contaminant.

I'll email you the URL of the 1943 memo to General
Leslie Grove under the Manhattan Project. It's the
blueprint for depleted uranium. They dropped the
atomic bombs, but they did not use the DU weapons
because they thought they were too horrific.

I've toured and gone all over Japan with a
pediatrician in Basra and an oncologist, a cancer
specialist. These poor doctors -- their whole
families are dying of cancer. He has 10 members of
his family with cancer now that he's treating, and
this is just from Gulf War I. They've used much,
much, much more in 2003. All over the whole
country.

ICONOCLAST: What can soldiers expect when they
come home?

MORET: If they were in Bradley Fighting Vehicles,
they're coming home with rectal cancer from
sitting on ammunition boxes. The young women are
reporting terrible problems with endometriosis.
That's the lining of the uterus malfunctioning,
and they just bleed and bleed and bleed. Some of
them have uterine cancer -- 18 and 19 and 20 year
olds. The Army will not even diagnose it. They
send them back to the battlefields. They won't
treat them or diagnose them. A group of 20
soldiers pushed from Kuwait to Baghdad in 2003 in
all the fighting. Eight of those 20 soldiers have
malignancies.

ICONOCLAST: Does exposure to depleted uranium
effect their psychological background when they
come home?

MORET: Depleted uranium are these particles that
form at very high temperatures. They are uranium
oxides that are insoluble. They are at least 100
times smaller than a white blood cell, so when the
soldiers breathe, they inhale them. The particles
go through the nose, go through the olfactory and
into the brain, and it messes up their cognitive
abilities, thought processes. It damages their
mood-control mechanism in the brain. Four soldiers
at Fort Bragg came back from Afghanistan, and
within two months, those four had murdered their
wives. This is part of the damage to the brain
from the radiation and the particles.

The soldiers from Gulf War I in a group of 67
soldiers who came back, they had DU in their
equipment, in their clothes, in their bodies, in
their semen, and they had normal babies before
they went over there to war. They came back, and
the VA did a study. Of 251 Gulf War I veterans in
Mississippi, in 67 percent of them, thier babies
born after the war were deemed to have severe
birth defects. They had brains missing, arms and
legs missing, organs missing. They were born
without eyes. They had horrible blood diseases.
It's horrific. If you want to look at something,
Life magazine did a photo essay which is still on
the Internet. It's called "The Tiny Victims of
Desert Storm." You should look at that -- oh, my
God, the post-Gulf War babies playing with their
brothers and sisters who are normal. Basically,
it's like smoking crack, only you're smoking
radioactive crack. It goes straight into the blood
stream. It's carried all throughout the body into
the bones, the bone marrow, the brain. It goes
into the fetus. It's a systemic poison and a
radiological poison.

ICONOCLAST: What about the people in the United
States that are here? You say that DU is being
mixed and spread globally?

MORET: Yes, it's being mixed globally. We're
getting secondary smoke. It's the secondary smoke
effect. You know the people who inhabit a room
with smokers? They are getting that secondary
smoke, and so are we.

ICONOCLAST: Is that secondary smoke getting
thicker as we speak?

MORET: Yeah, the concentration of the depleted
uranium particles in the atmosphere all around the
globe is increasing. There are indications that
the U.S. will go in June and bomb the heck out of
Iran. We're monitoring the U.S. Army ammunition
factories. They have very large orders for those
huge bunker buster bombs that have 5,000 lbs. of
DU in the warhead.

ICONOCLAST: So the prognosis for America isn't
really good?

MORET: No, it's really bad.

ICONOCLAST: And if this continues then?

MORET: It's going to kill off the world's
population. It already is, and it doesn't just
effect people. It effects all living systems. The
plants, the animals, the bacteria. It effects
everything.

ICONOCLAST: So the things that we eat for
instance, if they have DU in them, then we'll just
get it in our systems, and so we're polluting the
oceans, so that could effect all marine life?

MORET: Yes, it's in the air, water, and soil. The
half- life of DU, Uranium 238, is 4.5 billion
years the age of the Earth.

ICONOCLAST: With the damage that's been done to
this point, can we turn back? We can't clean it
up?

MORET: There's no way to clean it up. What happens
is these tiny particles float around the Earth.
There are still plutonium and uranium floating
around the Earth from bomb testing. These
particles are so tiny that molecules bumping into
them keep them lofted in the air, and so the only
way for them to get out of the atmosphere is rain,
snow, fog, pollution, which will clear them out of
the air and deposit them in the environment. What
happens is the surface of these particles gets
wetted by the moisture in the air. They come down
and land on stuff and stick to it like a glue. You
can't ever get the particles off whatever they're
sticking to because have you ever put a drop of
water on a microscope slide and then put another
one on top of it? Can you pull those apart?

ICONOCLAST: No.

MORET: Okay, that's the same effect that happens
to radioactive particles. Once they are removed
from the atmosphere, they stick to any surfaces
they land on. In a way they are removed from
circulation from the atmosphere. You can't wash
them off. If it keeps raining or they're in a
creek, you know, if they're on rocks or stones or
something in a creek, they won't even wash off.
You didn't know it was this bad, did you?

ICONOCLAST: No, I knew it was bad, but I thought
it was fairly isolated.

MORET: No. What is over there (in Iraq) is over
here in about four days. I don't know if you
followed Chernobyl. That big bubble of radiation
went around and around the world, but this is
dust. It becomes a part of atmospheric dust. Like
the dust storm you saw in that photo, it goes
everywhere.

ICONOCLAST: Is it in the upper levels of the
atmosphere or the lower levels?

MORET: It's in lower orbital space. They brought
the Mir spacecraft back down to Earth when they
got done using it, and there was something called
a space midge which covered the electronics on the
outside of the spacecraft and protected it from
radiation that comes from the sun because
electronics are real vulnerable to radiation. They
analyzed the surface of that space net and found
uranium and uranium decayed products which they
said came from atmospheric testing or burned up
spacecraft with nuclear materials or nuclear
reactors on board. Uranium can also come from
supernovas, but they thought that the most likely
sources were atmospheric testing and the nuclear
materials we put in space.

ICONOCLAST: Essentially then, you're saying that
we're conducting a nuclear war.

MORET: Yes, and that's exactly what it is. We've
conducted four nuclear wars since 1991. Yeah,
these are nuclear wars. DU is a nuclear weapon.

ICONOCLAST: From the point of view of a scientist,
what needs to happen to correct this?

MORET: Well, we need to stop the use of it. We've
built an international movement to stop the use,
the manufacture, the storage, the sales, and the
deployment of depleted uranium weapons.

ICONOCLAST: Are the munitions we sell to other
countries contained with depleted uranium?

MORET: We have. In 1968 the first depleted uranium
weapons systems that we found a patent for
suddenly appeared in the U.S. patent office. It
was for the Navy. It was sort of a Gatling gun
style weapon system that you mounted on ships. It
rapidly fires like 2,500 bullets a minute. It's
over 3,000 now. They've improved the design. Then
in 1973, we gave depleted uranium weapons systems
to the Israelis and supervised their use. They
used them in the Arab-Israeli war and completely
wiped out the Arabs in five days. Then the show
was on the road. That was the first actual
battlefield demonstration of this new weapon
system. Hughes Aircraft developed the full-length
system which is for the Navy. That's the Gatling
gun system. They still use it. That was produced
in 1974 and tested. Within six months the U.S.
government had sold the DU weapons system to 12
entities which included many branches of the U.S.
military and other counties. We've sold DU weapons
systems to about -- we don't know exactly for sure
-- it's been about 12 or 17 countries. The good
news is that normally such a weapons system that
effective would have been sold to 80, 100, or 120
countries by now. But because of the radiological,
biological, and environmental hazard, countries
were not only afraid to buy it, the ones who did
buy it are afraid to use it. The only countries we
know that have used DU are Britain, the U.S., and
Israel. The United Nations in 1996 passed a
resolution that depleted uranium weapons are
weapons of mass destruction, and they are illegal
under all international laws and treaties.

In 2001, the European Parliament passed a
resolution on DU. What happened is that the NATO
forces went into Yugoslavia in 1998 and '99 and
flew 39,000 bombing runs and completely bombed
Yugoslavia into radioactive rubble. Germany and
the U.S. made the most money on the destruction of
Yugoslavia, and they made sure that countries that
didn't know about the DU, that the peacekeepers
from those countries like from Italy and Portugal,
were sent to the most contaminated regions in
Yugoslavia. Germans and Americans didn't send
their own troops into those areas. They were in
the least contaminated areas. These poor soldiers
from other countries came back and died within
weeks or in a couple of days or months. The
parents in Portugal and Italy are furious and went
to the Parliament and media, and there was just a
huge media storm of articles about DU.

The cat was out of the bag because of the 1998
NATO invasion of Yugoslavia. The cat was out of
the bag, but Japanese troops have been sent into
Somawa. They're self-defense forces. It was the
most contaminated area where the heaviest fighting
happened in Iraq. We can expect those soldiers to
be really, really sick.

ICONOCLAST: What about Iraq itself? What's been
done thus far?

MORET: It's uninhabitable. The whole country.
Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Afghanistan are completely
uninhabitable.

ICONOCLAST: But people live there, so they're
going to live there suffering?

MORET: Well, you can see from the birth defects
and the illnesses that it is pretty severe. Each
year the number of birth defects and illnesses
will rise because of the total contamination
levels in all living things will increase because
they are breathing that air and drinking water and
eating the food from contaminated soils. It's just
a slow death sentence. The same with Yugoslavia
and Afghanistan.

Depleted uranium is a very, very, very effective
biological weapon. This is the primary purpose for
using it. Marion Falk (a retired chemical
physicist who built nuclear bombs for more than 20
years at Lawrence Livermore lab), who is the
Manhattan Project scientist I work with, taught me
pretty much everything about radiation and
particles and DU. He said the purpose of weapons
used by the military is not only to injure and
kill the enemy soldiers, but the purpose is to
kill, maim, and disease the civilian population
because it reduces the productivity of a country
and pretty soon a lot of their resources are going
to be used for taking care of sick people. They
will have fewer and fewer healthy workers.

Of course, once you cause mutation in the DNA,
that damage is passed on to future generations of
that affected person or animal or plant. DNA does
not repair itself.

ICONOCLAST: So the mutations would be probably
destructive moreso than constructive.

MORET: Oh, the mutations are causing those birth
defects.

ICONOCLAST: They're not evolutionary diseases?

MORET: No, they are evolutionary. They are
inherited by all future generations and passed on.
It's like if you have red hair and all of your
future generations will have that gene.

ICONOCLAST: So if I had a precondition to heart
disease because of the radiation, then the
generation that would come after me would have the
same problem?

MORET: Well, if you damage the cell or parts of
the cell or functioning of cells, that doesn't
necessarily damage the DNA. There are two kinds of
damage: one damages the cells of the living
organism, and that may not be passed on, but if
you damage the DNA in the egg or the sperm, that
is passed on to all future generations.

ICONOCLAST: So the guys coming back from the war,
their sperm is probably going to be --

MORET: Damaged. Yes. They also have depleted
uranium in their semen. When they're intimate with
their partners, they internally contaminate them
with depleted uranium. The women become sick
themselves. They have depleted uranium in their
bodies, and there is something called burning
syndrome. Just absolutely horrible. You can read
about it in an article by David Rose in the
December Vanity Fair. It's on the Internet. A
friend of mine is the widow of a Canadian Gulf War
veteran. David Rose interviewed her, and she
griped about the burning semen. She said, "I had
20 condoms full of frozen peas in my freezer at
all times, and after we were intimate, I would
insert one into my vagina, and that is the only
way I could bear the pain from the burning semen."
And it goes through condoms, too.

ICONOCLAST: Gosh, durn!

MORET: Yeah, you should see the high school
classes when I talk about the burning semen and
the internal contamination. The girls' mouths go
into little round Os, and the boys start panicking
because they're like, "I'll never get sick!"
(laughs) The name of this article is "Weapons of
Self-Destruction."

ICONOCLAST: How much DU will it take to kill off
all known life on this planet?

MORET: The amount of radiation released is
certainly going to have a very, very profound
global impact, and we're already seeing infant
mortality increasing globally. The fetus is the
most susceptible to radiation damage because all
the cells are rapidly dividing, the limbs and the
bodies developing, so when you start introducing
toxic chemicals and radiation, it really damages
the natural process of fetal development.

The reason they were able to convince the Senate
to sign the partial test ban treaty in 1963 was
because of the increase in infant mortality. It
had been dropping and declining two or three
percent for quite a long time each year because of
better prenatal care and educating mothers. Infant
mortality started going up after the bombs were
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, especially in
the '50s when the big bomb testing started. By
1963, it was really obvious that the bomb testing
globally was having a real impact on the unborn.
They signed the partial test ban treaty. Russia
and the U.S. stopped atmospheric testing, and the
infant mortality rate started going down right
away. They're going up again now. This is global
radioactive pollution, and how long it would take
to eliminate all life is something nobody knows,
but the depleted uranium is a very, very effective
biological weapon.

There are two purposes for the military use of
weapons. One is to destroy the enemy soldiers, and
the other, which is just as important, is to
destroy the enemy civilian population. By causing
illnesses and disease, long lingering illnesses
really impact the productivity and the economy of
a country. It was Chernobyl and other nuclear
disasters that actually destroyed the Soviet Union
because the former Soviet Union is very, very sick
from all the radiation that was released. They
were much more sloppier than we were. I have a
World Health Organization world health survey
which they published in the Journal of American
Medical Association last June. The impact of
atmospheric testing is very, very apparent by the
percentage of population in each country they
investigated for some form of mental illness. For
instance, Japan is 8.8 percent. Nigeria is very
low -- 4.7 percent. They have almost no radiation
in Nigeria. In the Ukraine where they had the
Chernobyl accident, it is 20.4 percent. Spain is
at 9.2 percent. Italy is 8.2 percent. It's pretty
low because they don't have nuke plants. France is
75 percent reliant on nuclear power, so you have
mental illness in 18.4 percent of the population.
Mexico is at 12.2 percent, and the United States
is at 26.3 percent -- the highest rate of mental
illness in the world.

And George Bush and his siblings were all exposed
in utero to bomb testing fallout in the United
States. He had a toddler sister who died of
leukemia when she was about three. I worked with a
group called the Radiation And Public Health
Project. Their website is . We are all radiation
specialists, well-known scientists, and
independent scientists. We've collected 6,000 baby
teeth around nuclear power plants and measured the
radiation in them, and one of our members is the
neighbor of the women who worked with all of the
Bush children, including President Bush himself,
because they had severe learning disabilities.

ICONOCLAST: How do we know that the Bush children
were exposed?

MORET: By the year of their birth. The year they
were carried by their mother. You have to look at
how much bomb testing material was released into
the atmosphere, and there's a direct correlation
to the decline in SAT scores for all teenagers in
the U.S. to the amount of radiation that was
released into the atmosphere the year their mother
was carrying them. These are delayed effects of
radiation exposure in utero.

ICONOCLAST: So they were living in Connecticut,
but they were still feeling the effects of the
radiation in Nevada?

MORET: Two years ago the U.S. government admitted
that every single person living in the United
States between 1957 and 1963 was internally
exposed to radiation. So for any pregnant woman
during those years, her fetus was exposed.

ICONOCLAST: What type of radiation levels are we
talking about?

MORET: It's low levels, and the main pathways are
drinking water and dairy products. It even killed
the baby fish in the Atlantic. Strontium-90 is a
man-made isotope that comes out of nuclear bombs
and nuclear reactors. They measured the levels of
strontium-90 in milk in Norway from the 1950s up
until the 1970s, and they measured the decline in
the fishing catch in that same period, and as the
strontium-90 increased in the milk in Norway,
fishing catches declined. By 1963, when the U.S.
tested a nuclear bomb almost every day (they did
250 tests in one year because the treaty was going
to be signed), the fishing catch declined by 50
percent. In the Pacific, it declined 60 percent
because there was Russian, Chinese, French, and
U.S. testing in the Pacific.

ICONOCLAST: So we're still eating those
contaminated fish today. Has the genetic code been
changed?

MORET: The oceans are getting whatever is getting
rained down, snowed down, or fogged down from the
atmosphere. It's getting into the oceans. This big
frog die-off, which is global, is certainly
related to the radiation in the rainwater. It's a
global nuclear holocaust. It effects all living
things. That's why they call it "omnicide," which
means it kills all living things -- the plants,
the animals, the bacteria. Everything.

ICONOCLAST: You think we ought to have the Weather
Channel report on the current sand storm
conditions in Iraq so we can prepare four days in
advance for the radiation?

MORET: I'll tell you what I did when 9/11
happened. I called all the doctors with Radiation
And Public Health Project, and I said, "Get out of
town, and don't come back until it has rained
three times." One lived 12 miles downwind from the
Pentagon. She went out on her balcony with her
geiger counter. I said, "Get that geiger counter
out of your purse." We had just done a press
conference in San Francisco, and I knew she had it
in her purse. Well, the radiation levels were 8-10
times higher than background. We called the EPA,
HAZMAT, FBI, and said, "Get all those emergency
response workers suited up. They need to be
protected." Two days after 9/11, the EPA radiation
expert for that region called back and said, "Yup,
the Pentagon crash rubble was radioactive, and we
believe it's depleted uranium, but we're not
worried about that. It's only harmful if it's
inhaled." He said, "We're worried about the lead
solder in the plane." Well, you know what's in
Tomahawk missiles? They have depleted uranium
warheads. The radioactive crash rubble
contaminated with DU is evidence of a DU warhead.

ICONOCLAST: I did not think about that, but going
back to my original question: Should the Weather
Channel report for us on the toxic dust storms in
Iraq?

MORET: But how could people get away from them?
These dust storms are a million square miles.
They're huge, and they come right across the
Atlantic, the Caribbean, and Texas coast line, and
right up the East Coast. There are people who are
going to leave the state every time there's a
hurricane It's in the food, drinking water, dairy
products, and then the problem with Uranium 238,
which is 99.39 percent DU, is that it decays in
over 20 steps into other radioactive isotopes.
That's why I call it the "Trojan Horse." It's the
weapon that keeps giving. It keeps killing. This
is like smoking radioactive crack. It goes right
in your nose. It crosses the olfactory bulb into
your brain. It's a systemic poison. It goes
everywhere. These particles that form at very high
temperatures -- 5,000-10,000 degrees C -- are
nanoparticles. They are a 10th of a micron or
smaller. A 10th of a micron is 100 times smaller
than a white blood cell. They get picked up in the
lipids and probably the cholesterol and go right
through the cell membranes of the cell. They screw
up the cell processes. They screw up the signaling
between the cells because the cells all talk to
each other and coordinate what they're doing. It
messes up brain function.

ICONOCLAST: Do you know what Iraq was like before
the first Gulf War?

MORET: Iraq prior to the 1991 Gulf War was the
most advanced in the entire Middle East. They had
scrupulous databases of the health problems and
disease rates, which is why the U.S. bombed all of
the offices in the Ministry of Health. We
destroyed all those records so that a pre-Gulf War
health base could not be established to show how
much these diseases have increased. This would
concern the U.S. in terms of compensation for war
crimes. In these horrible U.N. sanctions, they
(the Iraqis) could never get all of the protocol
medicine for the treatment of leukemia. They (the
U.N.) would say, "These steps of the leukemia
treatment were components in weapons, so you can't
have that." They never gave the people the full
proper protocols in the areas of treatment they
needed to get rid of the leukemia. It hid the
effects of the depleted uranium because the
children were starving. They had malnutrition.
They had the healthiest population in the Middle
East (prior to Gulf War I).

ICONOCLAST: Let's talk about the children of Iraq.

MORET: After the Gulf War, they had maybe one baby
a week born with birth defects in the hospitals in
Basra. Now they are having 10-12 a day. The levels
of uranium are increasing in the population every
year. Every day, people are eating and drinking
while the whole environment is contaminated. Just
what you'd expect. There are more babies born with
birth defects, and the birth defects are getting
more and more severe. An Iraqi doctor told me that
babies are being born now that are lumps of flesh.
She said that they don't have heads or legs or
arms. It's just a lump of flesh. This also
happened to populations that were not removed from
islands in the Pacific when the bomb tests
occurred. Basically, governments were using them
as guinea pigs.

ICONOCLAST: So all the countries that were
equipped with nuclear weapons are guilty of those
atrocities.

MORET: They were all doing it. France, Russia.
China, and the U.S. And I'm not sure if Britain
did bomb testing. They were real low key about it.

ICONOCLAST: Where are the radiation hot spots in
the United States?

MORET: In the United States, it would be within a
100 miles of nuclear power plants. We have 110
nuclear power plants in the U.S. We have the most
of any country in the world, but only a 103 are
operating. Almost all of the entire East Coast.
What we did was we took government data from the
Centers of Disease Control on breast cancer deaths
between 1985 and 1989. Anywhere from within a 100
miles of a nuclear power plant is where two-thirds
of all breast cancer deaths occurred in the U.S.
between 1985 and 1989.

It's also around the nuclear weapons laboratories.
That would be Los Alamos in New Mexico, the Idaho
Nuclear Engineering Lab in Idaho, and Hanford in
Washington State, which is where they got the
plutonium for all the bombs. They contaminated the
entire Columbia River watershed and almost the
whole state of Washington. It gets into the water
and into the plants and into the vegetation. If
you eat clams or mussels or crabs or things like
that, even certain kinds of fish that eat off of
the mud at the bottom of the river, you have much
higher levels of radiation in your tissues. It
depends on each person and on how healthy they
are, but this man from Washington State died
suddenly. He was in his late 40s. They did an
autopsy, and he was full of radioactive zinc. They
went, "Where in the world did he get this? It only
comes from nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors."
They studied his diet and discovered he loved to
eat oysters. They found out where he bought his
oysters and found the oyster beds. They were 200
miles off shore, from Washington State. The
radiation was being carried off out to sea from
the coastline. It was passing over this oyster
bed. The oysters were just gobbling them up.

ICONOCLAST: What are the symptoms of DU poisoning?

MORET: Soldiers on the battlefield have reported a
metallic taste in their mouth. That's the actual
taste of the uranium metal. Then within 24-48
hours, soldiers on the battlefield have reported
that they felt sick. They start getting muscle
aches, and they lose energy. Some of them came
back incontinent. In other words, in adult
diapers.

One woman reported that the first night home, she
wanted to be intimate with her husband, but she
had absolutely no feeling. She couldn't feel
anything from the waist down. This particulate
matter damages the neuromuscular system, the
nerves; it just goes everywhere. And there's no
treatment for it. These particles are very, very
insoluble, so they can't even dissolve in body
fluids, so they can be excreted from the body.
Then they keep releasing. Even when uranium
decays, it turns into another radioactive isotope.
So it's a particle that just sits there shooting
bullets until you die.

Another problem is that soldiers have crumbling
teeth. Teeth just start falling apart. The uranium
replaces calcium in the calcium-phosphate
structure of the teeth. Some have complained about
grand mal seizures, cerebral palsy. Some diseases
reported at very high rates in Air Force and Army
soldiers are Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's
disease, and Hodgkin's disease. This is damage to
the mitochondria in the cells and the nerves. The
mitochondria make all the energy for the body, so
when you damage mitochondria, another symptom is
chronic fatigue syndrome. There's just not enough
energy produced by the body to function normally.
I found a study in the SanDia Nuclear Weapons
Laboratory employee newsletter in September 2003.
They are doing major studies in mitochondrial
disfunction related to Lou Gehrig's, Hodgkin's,
and Parkinson's diseases for veterans. Since it's
at a nuclear weapon's lab, they are fully aware of
the health damage.

ICONOCLAST: Tell me about the tests that detect
for DU in the body.

MORET: The chromosome test in the best indicator.
It's $5,000. The urine test is a $1,000. If you
test positive with the urine test, you know you're
contaminated. If you test negative, it does not
mean that you're not contaminated. It just means
that you may or may not be contaminated but enough
hasn't dissolved in your blood stream to go
through your kidneys to be excreted in your urine.
Anyone who goes now cannot avoid being
contaminated. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Everyone who
goes to the Middle East and Afghanistan will be
contaminated. The DU issue affects every single
living thing on this planet. What else has that
impact? They have altered the genome for the
entire planet forever with this DU. The Pentagon
people say, "You're exaggerating or you use the
uranium word to scare people." I don't care if
people believe me or not. All I can say is that
over time what I am saying will actually be an
underestimation of the long term effects.

Water poisons town's atmosphere

Web Posted: 05/29/2005 12:00 AM CDT

Anton Caputo
Express-News Staff Writer

RICARDO Ñ Last October, 30 or so residents of this
small town just south of Kingsville received a
letter from the federal Environmental Protection
Agency warning them not to drink the water.

Uranium and radiation levels as high as eight
times the federal safety standards had been
detected in the water wells of the Garcia Hills
neighborhood, a collection of about 10 homes in
rural Kleberg County.

Residents, the letter warned, "need to be aware of
this health risk and consult their family doctor."
Drinking high levels of uranium could lead to
kidney damage, it stated.

Suddenly, a case of kidney cancer and two more of
fatal bone cancer in the neighborhood over the
past decade seemed a lot less like chance.

"When I saw that it scared me," said Humberto
Garcia, 61. "I stopped drinking the water."

The letter didn't suggest a culprit, but
suspicions immediately turned to a nearby uranium
mining operation that is extracting the
radioactive substance from the ground under the
community.

The company, Dallas-based Uranium Resources Inc.,
denies having any role, arguing that the
contamination seeped naturally into the wells and
likely had been there for years.

"The only person they could assign blame to is
Mother Nature," said Mark Pelizza, URI vice
president in charge of health, safety and
environmental affairs.

For the mine, the problem couldn't have come at a
worse time. The financially troubled company wants
to expand its operations into land it leases from
the Garcia Hills residents.

At the same time, the industry is pressing for
legislation that would smooth the way for future
expansions.

Critics oppose the legislation, which they say
would change state regulations by cutting
communities out of the decision-making process and
severely limiting public notice.

The changes are included in amendments proposed by
Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, to an unrelated
bill that has been referred to a conference
committee of House and Senate leaders for
compromise.

The House and Senate have until midnight today to
pass any legislation, although the deadline can be
extended.

Furious residents and community activists are
working to quash the new regulations. They're also
challenging the proposed Ricardo expansion in an
administrative hearing process that begins Aug 1.

After the hearings, an administrative law judge
will recommend a solution to the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality.

"It's a bunch of crap," said Annie Saenz, 56, who
was born and raised in Garcia Hills. "They don't
care. They don't live here and they always get
their way because it's all politics."

To further complicate matters, the company has
been on the verge of bankruptcy for a decade,
making regulators wary about too harshly
penalizing URI.

This became clear in 2000, when the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, now TCEQ,
allowed the company to use a portion of its $6
million security bond to begin cleaning up two
mines in South Texas, including the one in
Ricardo.

The move was unusual because the state requires
uranium companies to post bonds to ensure
environmental cleanup in the event that a company
goes bankrupt, and generally does not allow
companies to draw on that money.

At the time, state environmental officials said
they allowed URI to use the money to keep the
company from going bankrupt and potentially
leaving a costly environmental problem behind.

"I believe that is not perfectly legal and shows
the manner in which the state treats URI," said
Austin attorney Melanie Oberlin, who represents
the local activist group South Texas Opposes
Pollution (STOP).

Many of these issues should come to a head in
August when the sides are set to argue the merits
of URI's proposed expansion in front of an
administrative law judge.

Until then, both sides are scrambling for the
evidence to support their case.

"One of the troubles with the whole issue is that
no one is putting forth data to show historical
water quality in the area, and that's exactly what
we need," Oberlin said.

URI contends there's plenty of data, and that it
shows the company has nothing to do with the
contamination.

The company actually mined the site, which is
about a quarter mile from the Garcia Hills wells,
for about a year in 1998 and 1999 before
plummeting uranium prices forced the firm to stop
operations.

A year later, a district court judge ruled state
regulators had incorrectly denied concerned
citizens a contested hearing when URI had proposed
the expansion. Therefore, URI has to go through
the hearing process this time.

Company officials said they want to reopen the
site to capitalize on uranium prices that have
soared from about $8 a pound to $29 a pound in the
past three years.

Pelizza said the company drilled several test
wells in 1997 before expanding, and that all
showed high levels of radium, indicating the
contamination was natural, he said.

He ruled out the possibility that the high levels
could have been tied to the company's other mines
about 2 miles away.

"That's conceptually impossible," Pelizza said.
"Groundwater migrates about 30 feet a year."

The company extracts the uranium by using a method
called in-situ leaching.

Oxygen and a bicarbonate solution are pumped into
the groundwater to free radioactive elements, and
then the solution is pumped back to the surface
where the uranium is removed.

The treated wastewater, which URI officials say is
cleaner than the original, then is returned into
the ground.

Garcia Hills originally was settled by patriarch
Jorge Garcia more than seven decades ago. The
family members agreed to lease property on the
240-acre ranch to URI in the 1993, a decision they
uniformly regret.

Humberto Garcia said his share of the lease fees
is about $1,100 a year, which he's been mailing
back to the company for the past four or five
years.

"They made it look so good on paper," he said. "We
don't want any part of it."

Historically, the Garcias obtained their water
from two wells drilled into the Goliad Aquifer.
That all changed less then two months ago, when,
in response to the EPA letter, the neighborhood
hooked into water from the South Texas Water
Authority.

For residents like Hermila Garcia and her
91-year-old sister, Santos, the change represented
a hardship. The woman traded in a $10-a-month
payment for their share of the electricity to run
the community's well for an $80-a-month water
bill.

"God is good," Hermila said. "Maybe he will help
us."

Local residents and activists view the battle as a
David vs. Goliath situation that has them
overmatched every step of the way.

The Kleberg County Commission had seemed to offer
help in the fight, but the county pulled itself
out of the battle earlier this year when it struck
a groundwater monitoring agreement with URI.

Residents also thought that forming a groundwater
district might give them more control. But that
attempt, sponsored by Rep. Juan Escobar,
D-Kingsville, died in committee early this month
after URI lobbied hard against it.

Now the group is gearing up for August's hearing,
holding fundraising events and raffles to hire the
needed groundwater experts.

"We have been fighting this for 20 years. We're
not going to stop," former local school principal
Edna Figueroa said. "It's just, please God, keep
the pennies coming so we can get to Aug. 1."

Emergency Sirens Have No Backup at 28 U.S. Reactor Sites
WASHINGTON, DC, May 27, 2005 (ENS) - 

In the event
of a simultaneous accident where a nuclear power
station melts down at the same time the main power
lines fail, the emergency siren system for the
entire emergency planning zone would lose power
and not be operable to alert people to an
approaching radioactive cloud at 28 reactor sites
across the country.

In response to a petition filed by Nuclear
Information and Resource Service (NIRS) and 16
other organizations and local governments, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has revealed
that 28 reactor emergency plan zone siren systems
are entirely reliant upon electricity from their
regional grid.

Another 18 sites have only partial emergency power
backup available to siren systems.

Only 17 reactor sites have siren systems that are
fully backed up with emergency power systems so
that they would remain operable independent of the
failure of main power lines.

The Department of Homeland Security and the
Federal Emergency Management Agency have been
engaged in revising public notification systems
since the August 14, 2003 northeast electricity
blackout, but no date for completion is available.

This information was contained in a NRC denial,
issued May 20, 2005, of an emergency enforcement
petition submitted on February 23, 2005 requesting
that emergency back up power supplies consisting
of rechargeable batteries, preferably on
photovoltaic solar panels be back fitted to all
public alert systems around the nation's nuclear
power stations.

The NRC released a list Wednesday specifying
reactors sites without power back up, partial back
up and full back up.

"These siren systems would not have worked from
day one if the grid failed the same time these
reactors melted down," said Paul Gunter, director
of the Reactor Watchdog Project for the Nuclear
Information and Resource Service (NIRS).

"NRC is saying that public safety can wait on
bureaucratic foot dragging that can leave
communities not only in the dark but without
emergency notification if there is a nuclear melt
down," he said. "The 17 sites that have emergency
power for all their sirens is enough to
demonstrate that it can and should be done for all
of the reactor sites, today," Gunter said.

The petition documents that grid failures as the
result of lightning, hurricanes, ice storms,
earthquakes as well as mechanical failures in the
electricity distribution system routinely cause a
loss of power to community alerting systems around
nuclear power stations. The loss of offsite power
significantly increases the risk of a core melt
accident because of reduced safety systems.

Typically, NRC mock terrorist attack tests at
reactor sites begin with the assumption that the
main power lines are down.

In its denial NRC argued that it is inappropriate
for affected communities to take up the request
for back up power for sirens under the agency's
emergency enforcement petition process.

Instead, NRC determined that a request for back
fitting the nuclear industry with emergency power
for its siren systems should go through NRC's
petition for rule making, a bureaucratic process
typically involving two years of deliberations.

NRC claims it does not want to duplicate efforts
of the DHS/FEMA to revise guidance on outdoor
warning and mass notification systems as directed
by the House Committee on Appropriations following
the August 14, 2003 blackout.

NRC does not dispute the fact that many siren
systems around nuclear power stations will fail in
the event of a radiological release coinciding
with a power blackout. The NRC and nuclear
industry's current fall back position is to rely
upon "local route notifications" where first
responders such as police and fire departments,
get into emergency vehicles and communicate
instructions through bull horns while traveling
through neighborhoods within the 10 mile emergency
planning zone.

"It's absurd to suggest that with an approaching
radioactive cloud an already overburdened police
or fire department driving around neighborhoods
with bull horns or along roads, some possibly
impassible, can adequately compensate for
deliberately leaving these sirens inoperable,"
said Gunter.

"NRC has sole jurisdiction to require reactor
operators to back fit the emergency notification
system for the emergency planning zone," said
Gunter. "It is the responsibility of reactor
operator to demonstrate and maintain its emergency
notification system to work," Gunter said.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports:

* 1.Sites with backup power to all sirens

Millstone, Pilgrim, Seabrook, Crystal River,
Farley, St. Lucie, Turkey Point, Vogtle, Fermi,
Monticello, Palisades, Perry, Prairie Island,
Callaway, River Bend, Columbia, Waterford

* 2.Sites with backup power to some sirens

Three Mile Island, Shearon, Harris, North Anna,
Surry, Braidwood, Byron, Cook, Dresden, Duane,
Arnold, LaSalle, Quad Cities, Comanche Peak,
Arkansas Nuclear One, Diablo Canyon, Cooper, Palo
Verde, San Onofre, South Texas

* 3.Sites without backup power to any sirens

Beaver Valley, Calvert Cliffs, Fitzpatrick/Nine
Mile Point, Ginna, Indian Point, Limerick, Oyster
Creek, Peach Bottom, Salem/Hope Creek,
Susquehanna, Vermont Yankee, Browns Ferry,
Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee, Robinson,
Sequoyah, Summer, Watts Bar, Clinton, Davis-Besse,
Kewaunee Point, Beach, Fort Calhoun, Grand Gulf,
Wolf Creek

Hatch nuclear power station in Georgia does not
utilize a siren system within its emergency
planning zone but a distributed tone alert system.

Space junk rings Mother Earth

But heavenly housecleaning is out of reach

BY FRANK D. ROYLANCE

Baltimore Sun

On Jan. 17, the engine from a Thor rocket launched
31 years ago was soaring southward, 550 miles over
the African continent. At the same time, a
fragment of a Chinese rocket that blew up five
years ago was high over the Pacific Ocean, also
headed south.

Incredibly, the two chunks of metal flew into the
same spot over Antarctica at the same instant.

The high-speed collision, reported last month by
NASA's Orbital Debris Quarterly News, created even
more orbiting space junk. It also drew renewed
attention to the litter that surrounds our planet
Ñ and efforts to keep the neighborhood from
becoming even more cluttered and dangerous.

"It's sort of a classic environmental problem, not
unlike air pollution or water pollution," said
Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program
manager for NASA's orbital debris program. "If you
wait until you start seeing negative consequences,
then the environment is pretty far gone already,
and cleaning it up can be very, very difficult."

When the shuttle Discovery is finally launched,
most likely in July, it will join more than 13,000
pieces of orbiting hardware that the U.S. military
tracks 24 hours a day.

Among them are hundreds of working satellites Ñ
and thousands of dead ones Ñ along with spent
rockets and other odd scraps set loose by decades
of breakups, explosions and collisions.

The junk pile includes about a ton of radioactive
fuel from defunct reactors launched into orbit
before the practice ended in 1988, according to a
recent report to the Fourth European Conference on
Space Debris.

Much of the material is concentrated in "low-Earth
orbit," which extends to about 1,200 miles and is
home to the International Space Station and
hundreds of communications, environmental,
scientific and spy satellites.

A thousand more satellites Ñ about half of them
working Ñ cluster in a slender ring, like a
bicycle tire, about 22,000 miles above the
equator. They orbit once a day, hanging above the
same spot on the ground as the Earth spins. These
"geosynchronous" orbits are ideal for
communications satellites, which must stay in view
of fixed dish antennas on the ground.

Everything larger than a softball is tracked 24
hours a day by the 1st Space Control Squadron.
It's a part of the U.S. Air Force Space Command,
tucked deep into Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado
Springs, Colo., along with the nation's aerospace
and ballistic missile warning centers.

Satellite tracking began in 1957, with the launch
of the Soviets' Sputnik I Ñ the first man-made
object ever orbited. Today, data from a worldwide
network of 21 telescopes and radars called the
Space Surveillance Network stream into powerful
computers deep inside the Cheyenne Mountain
fortress. The system can register 350,000 contacts
per day, according to Michael Stringer, the
squadron's technical director.

Every year, some objects fall back to Earth, while
new ones are launched. On average, the squadron
logs a net increase of 200 objects per year.

Uncounted for are hundreds of thousands, perhaps
millions, of bits of space litter too small to be
seen Ñ ranging from nuts and bolts to paint chips.
They may be small, but with closing speeds of up
to 12 miles per second, Stringer said, they pack
tremendous energy.

Inspections have shown that the space shuttles and
the International Space Station are hit routinely
by particles too small to track. "We can't
determine where it came from, but we can tell if
it was titanium or aluminum, or a paint flake or
plastic," Johnson said.

In 1999, Discovery landed with evidence of 64
impacts, at least 10 caused by man-made debris. So
far, nothing bigger than 0.08 of an inch has
struck a shuttle. But even such tiny particles can
damage thermal tiles and windows. "We wind up
replacing the outer panes of at least two windows
every mission because of impacts with small
debris," Johnson said.

It's the big hunks of space junk that really worry
NASA. On May 29, 2003, for example, military
trackers warned NASA that debris would pass less
than a mile from the space station. The station is
shielded against objects 1 centimeter wide or
smaller, but the heft and trajectory of this one
alarmed Houston, and the station moved to a
slightly higher orbit.

"We do about one maneuver per year on average. But
we get lots of warnings; they come in more than
once a month," Johnson said.

NASA estimates that there are hundreds of
near-hits Ñ tracked objects passing within a
kilometer of each other Ñ every day. But at least
for now, collisions are rare. The first one ever
detected occurred July 24, 1996, when the French
Cerise spacecraft smacked into a piece of the
third stage of a European Ariane rocket that blew
up in 1986. A search of historical data recently
revealed a previously unnoticed smashup, in late
December 1991, between one defunct Russian Cosmos
satellite and debris from another.

Eventually, most objects in low-Earth orbit
disappear when they re-enter the atmosphere, at
the rate of three to five a month. And while most
of them melt and vaporize on the way down,
components with high melting points can survive.
Impacts in densely populated areas, while
unlikely, do pose a risk of deaths or property
damage.

Since Jan. 1, 2001, 10 egg-shaped titanium casings
from rockets that launched Navstar global
positioning satellites have fallen to Earth. At
least three of the 110-pound casings struck land Ñ
in Saudi Arabia, Argentina and Thailand.

In January 1997, a 551-pound stainless-steel
propellant tank from a Delta 2 rocket landed near
Georgetown, Texas.

Understandably, NASA and others would like to
clean up Earth's orbiting junkyard. Some have
proposed giant "nerf" balls or laser beams to slow
speeding debris and bring it down, Johnson said,
"but we do not yet have the technology to
economically make any substantial improvements."

Some limited efforts are afoot, however. NASA will
someday send a robot craft to latch onto the
Hubble Space Telescope and drag it safely into the
ocean.

And an international team is developing an
"electrodynamic tether" that could be unreeled by
satellites at the end of their lives. The wires,
tens of kilometers long, would speed the
satellites' plunge to Earth.

"It would be the most cost-effective way of doing
it," Johnson said. A test flight on a Russian
spacecraft is in the works.

NRC Unanimously Rejects Atomic Waste Deregulation
Rulemaking in Surprising Victory for
Environmentalists and Public

WASHINGTON, D.C.- By a 5-0 vote, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) has rejected a
rulemaking proposal by its staff that would have
permitted radioactive waste to be dumped in
municipal landfills, used in roadbeds, and
recycled into consumer products. The turnaround
was all the more remarkable because the
Commissioners themselves had earlier strongly
directed staff to prepare the waste deregulation
rulemaking in the first place.

Environmentalists cautiously praised the decision.
"The NRC clearly backed down from this crazy idea
because it recognized the firestorm of public
concern that would be triggered," said Daniel
Hirsch, President of the Los Angeles-based
Committee to Bridge the Gap (CBG) that has fought
such radioactive deregulation proposals for years.
"The public doesn't want radioactive waste in
their local garbage dump, children's braces, or
tools."

"This is an important victory for public health
and environmental protection," stated Diane
D'Arrigo of Nuclear Information and Resource
Service (NIRS), "although possibly temporary since
some commissioners want to proceed with it AFTER
new nuclear reactors are licensed. Maybe they
don't want the public to realize new nuclear
reactors means nuclear waste that could end up in
our kids' toys and other everyday items. The NRC
should be on notice, however: Don't even think of
trying this again. We'll remain vigilant."

In 1986 and 1990, the NRC tried a similar
deregulation plan, called "Below Regulatory
Concern" (BRC). It would similarly have permitted
radioactive waste to go to unlicensed landfills,
contaminated metals and other materials to be
recycled into consumer products, and other wastes
to avoid having to go to radioactive waste
disposal facilities licensed and designed for that
purpose. The BRC Policies created widespread
public opposition, media coverage and legislation
in numerous states. In 1992 Congress intervened
and overturned the NRC's radioactive waste
deregulation policies.

In 2002 the Commissioners directed NRC staff to
prepare a new regulation releasing significant
volumes of radioactive wastes from the requirement
that they be disposed of in licensed radioactive
waste facilities. In March 2005 the proposed
regulation was sent to the Commission for
approval. Numerous environmental groups weighed in
opposing it as a revival of the discredited BRC
Policy. This week, the Commissioners unanimously
rejected the proposed regulation. They did,
however, hold out the prospect of possibly
reviving it at some time in the futureÑ"two, five,
or ten years from now" according to one
Commissioner.

The NRC will, however, continue to release nuclear
waste under its current case-by-case exemption
procedures, which are not readily open to public
notice, comment or intervention. Opposition from
the public and state officials recently forced the
cancellation of shipments of reactor
decommissioning wastes to unlicensed waste sites
in Idaho and Texas that NRC staff had quietly
approved using the exemption process.

"While we are pleased that the Commissioners are
not moving forward with this ill-begotten
proposal, we remain concerned about the so-called
'case-by-case' releases that are occurring today,"
said Wenonah Hauter, director of the Energy
Program at Public Citizen. "No releases of
radioactively contaminated materials should be
allowed for reuse, recycling, or disposal into
municipal landfills. The NRC should make public
information about the releases that have occurred
thus far."

"This decision is a major step in the right
direction but it is tempered by the NRC's recent
deregulation of nuclear materials in transport,"
D'Arrigo continued, pointing out that "NRC, with
the US Department of Transportation has approved
some of the very same exemptions in the 2004
radioactive transport regulations. NIRS, CBG and
Public Citizen are among a group of organizations
now challenging the both agencies in federal court
for the transport exemptions.

Panel Sets Aside Proposal on Nuclear Waste

By H. JOSEF HEBERT
The Associated Press
Saturday, June 4, 2005; 12:07 AM

WASHINGTON -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has put on hold a proposal to allow some very
low-level radioactive waste to be routinely put
into public landfills or recycled instead of
shipped to special disposal sites.

By a 5-0 vote, the commission decided against
issuing a final regulation on the matter, although
it did not rule out considering the issue again in
the future. The agency's staff had recommended
that the rule change be approved, saying the waste
under consideration has such a low level of
radioactivity that it does not pose a public
health risk.

The NRC acted earlier this week, but the vote only
became public Friday in a news release from
several environmental and nuclear industry
watchdog groups.

The groups applauded the action, saying the
proposed rule change would have allowed
radioactive material to be mixed with normal
garbage and reused in consumer products and in
roadbeds.

NRC spokesman Elliott Brenner, confirming the
commission's action, said the agency did not
reject the proposal outright. "It is in a holding
pattern because of higher priorities. That's not
to rule out looking at it again later," he said.

"Most of these materials have no residual
radioactivity," he said. "Some have very small
amounts, so low that potential exposure to the
public would have negligible impact."

Brenner said the commission decided to put the
issue aside because of the "urgent need to put
resources in higher priority areas" such as
nuclear power plant security and a rush of
applications for power reactor relicensing.

The material subject to the proposed rule change
is located at nuclear power plants and other
facilities licensed by the NRC and includes such
items as office furniture, tools, equipment,
routine trash, soil and concrete.

Diane D'Arrigo of the Nuclear Information and
Resources Service, a watchdog group, said the
NRC's decision is "a victory for public health and
environmental protection," although she expressed
concern that the agency might reverse course.

"The NRC clearly backed down from this crazy idea
because it recognized the firestorm of public
concern that would be triggered," said Daniel
Hirsch, head of the Los Angeles-based Community to
Bridge the Gap. "The public doesn't want
radioactive waste in their local garbage dump,
children's braces or tools."

Plan to drill gas wells at radioactive site in limbo

Firm upped demand to four rigs from one

By Gargi Chakrabarty, Rocky Mountain News
June 3, 2005

A compromise between a Texas company and Garfield
County to drill for natural gas in an area where
an underground nuclear test in 1969 left much of
the gas radioactive has fallen through after the
company said it wants to drill four wells instead
of one.

The Woodlands, Texas-based Presco Inc. already had
won an endorsement from Garfield County
commissioners to drill within a half-mile buffer
zone established around the Project Rulison site.
Only the surface area would be disturbed, and the
well bottom would be below the restricted zone.

The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission
was scheduled to discuss that compromise on June
6.

But that discussion won't happen since Garfield
County is uncomfortable with Presco's position.

Late last month, Presco attorney William Keefe
said the company now wants to drill four wells in
the buffer zone. On Wednesday, the commissioners
voted to reject the four-well plan.

"I felt we had come to terms (with Presco) to
share information, do the analysis for one year,"
Commissioner John Martin said. "I thought we had a
gentleman's agreement, and they need to stand on
it."

Given the county's opposition, the commission has
asked Presco to resubmit its application.

If it does so, a full hearing might not be held
until October, said commission director Brian
Macke.

A nuclear device was detonated underground at the
site in 1969 as a test in hopes of freeing up
natural gas from oil shale.

The freed gas was considered too radioactive to be
sold commercially, though state and federal
officials have said nearby drilling would not
present a danger.

Drilling on hold near former nuke site
By The Associated Press

Glenwood Springs - A Texas natural-gas company
seeking permission to drill near the site of an
underground nuclear explosion surprised local
officials, who rejected its request to set up four
wells instead of one.

Presco Inc. has already won an endorsement from
Garfield County commissioners to drill within a
half-mile buffer zone established around the
Project Rulison site. Only the surface area would
be disturbed inside the zone, and the well bottom
would be outside the zone.

But late last month, Presco attorney William Keefe
said the company now wants to drill four wells in
the buffer zone.

On Wednesday, the commissioners voted to reject
the four-well plan.

"I felt we had come to terms (with Presco) to
share information, do the analysis for one year,"
Commissioner John Martin said. "I thought we had a
gentleman's agreement,   and they need to stand on
it."

A nuclear bomb was exploded at the site in 1969 in
hopes of freeing up natural gas from oil shale.
The gas was considered too radioactive to be sold
commercially, though state and federal officials
have said nearby drilling would not present a
danger.

The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission,
which issues drilling permits, planned to clarify
its prohibition on drilling within the buffer zone 
during a meeting Monday but has
postponed action until Presco amends or submits a
new application. The commission was expected to
make clear that it was all right to drill a hole
inside the buffer if the bottom of the well was
outside.

"Given all the back and forth between the county
and Presco, the staff decided to not move forward
on it," said Tricia Beaver, the agency's hearings
officer.

The commission will   wait for a revised
application from Presco and then most likely will
hold a hearing in Garfield County, Beaver said.

Geoffrey Thyne, research associate professor of
geology and geologic engineering at the Colorado
School of Mines in Golden, evaluated Energy
Department data collected in 1970.

Thyne, who is acting as a technical expert for the
county, said Presco should not drill more than one
well until the Energy Department issues a new  
report in 2007 on whether there is harmful
residual radioactivity at the site.

Agency rejects latest appeal of Skull Valley nuke storage
Safety board: A consortium could be a step closer to building the facility, but 
other avenues are available to the state
By Robert Gehrke
The Salt Lake Tribune
	
WASHINGTON - The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
on Tuesday rejected Utah's latest appeal seeking
to prevent Private Fuel Storage's plans to store
44,000 tons of nuclear waste on the Skull Valley
Goshute Indian reservation.

The board's decision means PFS is inching closer
to getting its license to build an interim spent
fuel-rod storage site 45 miles southwest of Salt
Lake City. PFS officials have said they could be
operating by 2007.

The state still has other avenues of
administrative appeal, and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs has yet to sign off on the deal.

The state also is asking the Interior Department
to throw out the Skull Valley Band's contract with
PFS, and to deny PFS a right-of-way for a rail
line to the reservation to move the waste. Another
angle of attack is U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop's proposal
in a Defense Department bill that would create a
wilderness area to block the rail line.

Should PFS continue to prevail with the federal
agencies, Utah can take the issue to a federal
appeals court, said assistant Utah Attorney
General Denise Chancellor.

Reaching that point "could be a month, it could be
four months" she said.

Nevertheless, PFS views the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board's decision as a victory.

"We're very pleased that the process is moving
forward," said Sue Martin, spokeswoman for PFS,
the group of electric companies proposing the
facility. "It has been moving forward. It's just
been at a glacial pace."

The state had asked the licensing board to reverse
a Feb. 24 ruling in favor of PFS, arguing that the
board underestimated the risk and consequences of
an F-16 fighter jet   smashing into the waste dump
while training at the nearby Air Force range.

"Given the result we reach today, nothing said
herein alters the status quo, under which the
commission has been, and continues to be, vested
by NRC regulations with the authority to issue the
requested license," the three-judge panel wrote.

In one part of the ruling, the judges were
unanimous in rejecting the Utah attorneys'
contention that the board should consider what
harm might occur if one of the casks is damaged
internally by an airplane crash.

However, the panel did suggest that the commission
direct NRC staff to conduct "diminished shielding"
studies to determine whether radiation might
escape from a cask that is damaged but not
breached and decide if those studies warrant
further research.

In the second part of the ruling, Judge Peter Lam
dissented from the other two judges, arguing
against the board's determination that the risk of
an F-16 crash was so remote - less than one in 1
million per year - that it should not prevent the
licensing from proceeding.

Lam argued the determination was based on
inadequate F-16 crash data.

Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, expressed frustration,
but no surprise. "I still think these are very
legitimate concerns and I think it's very
disappointing that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has approached this the way it has."

Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch expressed optimism.
"PFS will never, in my opinion, overcome all the
administrative, legal and economic hurdles," he
said.

Meantime, Utah's delegation was alarmed by
language in an Energy Department budget bill that
seeks to create an interim   nuclear storage site
by next year to house the waste until a permanent
repository in Yucca Mountain, Nev., is built.

A committee report accompanying the bill
recommends interim storage in Nevada, if existing
law can be changed, or at Energy Department sites
in South Carolina, Washington, Idaho or Nevada.
However, it also leaves open the option of a
"non-federal" storage site.

"I am very nervous about the interim storage issue
that is in this bill," said Matheson. "I'm nervous
about its effect on validating or enhancing the
viability of Private Fuel Storage."

Bishop asked the chairman of the subcommittee that
drafted the bill for assurances the storage
wouldn't take place at a site not run by the
Energy Department.

"I do not see any reason   the [Energy] secretary
would consider a private site or a site on federal
land or an Indian reservation for interim
storage," Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, replied.

  Federal Board Rejects Utah's Nuke Appeal

By CHRIS CLARK
The Associated Press
Tuesday, May 24, 2005; 9:24 PM

SALT LAKE CITY -- A federal licensing board on
Tuesday rejected Utah's appeal to thwart the
stockpiling of spent nuclear fuel rods at an
American Indian reservation.

The state had argued in April that radiation could
escape from waste casks if an outer protective
shield was breached, even if the interior canister
holding the fuel rods remained fully intact.

But lawyers for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said Utah's argument was too late and lacked
scientific merit, advising the three-member Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board to reject it.

Although turning aside the state's argument, the
board suggested the NRC study whether radioactive
waste could leak from a cask that was damaged but
not breached.

The ruling clears the way for the NRC to approve
the project, which would create a temporary waste
dump for spent rods on the reservation pending the
opening of a national repository at Nevada's Yucca
Mountain. It was not immediately clear when the
commission would issue its final decision.

The Goshute Indian tribe has sought the waste
station at its reservation in Skull Valley, about
45 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, hoping to
earn as much as $3 million. The tribe is teaming
with Private Fuel Storage to build the station,
which would store more than 40,000 tons of nuclear
waste.

The state had previously argued that the proposed
waste station's proximity to an Air Force base
increased the risk of a fighter jet crashing into
the spent fuel rods. The licensing board dismissed
that scenario as unlikely.

The state also contended that rods could end up
permanently in Utah because the Energy Department
isn't obligated to transport them to Nevada, but
the board rejected that argument in February.

Gov. Jon Huntsman's legal counsel, Mike Lee, said
the governor was disappointed with Tuesday's
ruling but "remains firm in his resolve to fight
this battle at every possible front."

He said the state is pursuing various options,
including appeals in the courts and with the NRC,
the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of
Indian Affairs.

PFS spokeswoman Sue Martin said the company was
pleased the process was moving forward.

"All of these challenges and the additional
hearings and things like that that have gone on
for the last eight years is evidence of how
rigorous this process is," she said.

The issue has wound its way through the courts
since Skull Valley Band Tribal Chairman Leon Bear
signed a lease in 1997 allowing PFS to store the
fuel on Goshute land.

The planned underground nuclear dump at Yucca
Mountain has also endured a string of problems.
The Energy Department recently abandoned a 2010
completion date and did not set a new one.

Waste starts leaving Fernald today
Truck Texas-bound with nuclear material

By Dan Klepal
Cincinatti Enquirer staff writer
ADVERTISEMENT

CROSBY TWP. - The first shipment of waste from the
long-closed Fernald uranium foundry will roll
through the plant's gates this afternoon on its
way to Texas.

The shipment is the first of an estimated 2,100
shipments of the Cold War-era radioactive material
that has been stored in two aging concrete storage
silos at the plant since the 1950s.

The shipments represent the last major hurdle in
completing the $4.4 billion environmental cleanup
being paid for by taxpayers.

Today's shipment will be the only one for a few
days.

Project Manager Dennis Carr said the second
shipment isn't scheduled until the end of the
week, and it will take about two months before the
project is fully ramped up and sending out 15
shipments a day.

"We're just going to have one vehicle on Monday
with a technical person on board," Carr said. "We
want the opportunity to talk with the individuals
at the weigh stations along the route, and answer
any questions they have. They'll be seeing these
shipments for the next nine or 10 months."

Government officials don't consider the shipments
to be potential targets for terrorists. Still, the
drivers have been trained to watch out for any
sort of strange behavior when they pull over to
rest, eat or gas up, said Dee Markelonis, vice
president of the Tennessee-based Visionary
Solutions, the trucking company that will haul the
waste.

"Our drivers are trained to notice if someone is
following them, watching them, or hanging around
their truck," Markelonis said. "Basically, if that
happens the person in question will get to spend
some quality time talking to a state trooper."

Although the waste is the most radioactive
material at the Fernald site - a byproduct of the
chemical process that removed uranium from metal -
it isn't thought to be terribly dangerous on the
road because it is being mixed with fly ash and
concrete, then poured into steel canisters to
harden for transport. The mixture contains between
15 percent and 20 percent waste and, even in the
event of an accident, probably would not spill out
of the canister, Carr said.

"We've done tests where we've dropped the
canisters (filled with a surrogate material) from
various heights and the canisters have never
broken open," Carr has said.

The government has been trying to figure out how
to get rid of the waste almost since the start of
the cleanup in the early 1980s. A failed 1990s
attempt at vitrification - turning the waste into
glass - wasted tens of millions of tax dollars.

More recently, the problem was not having a place
to send it. A Utah waste handler withdrew from
consideration after public outcry against dumping
the containers in that state.

The government's fallback plan - burying the stuff
in the Nevada desert - fell apart when the
attorney general there threatened a federal
lawsuit to keep the waste out of his state.

Then last month, Waste Control Specialists agreed
to store the material in its Andrews, Texas,
facility, while it pursues a license to
permanently dispose of it there. Even if it
doesn't get its disposal license, the material
cannot return to Ohio.

"This is a major accomplishment," Carr said. "It's
been a long process, and my whole team is pretty
excited about getting this job done."

Dangerous Liaisons
by Marilyn Berlin Snell

The company whose nuclear secrets leaked to Iran and North Korea now wants to
bring its know-how to New Mexico. What will be the fallout?


"The biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction 
in the hands of a terrorist network."
- George W. Bush, presidential debate, September 30, 2004

Three decades ago, a brilliant young Pakistani
metallurgist named Abdul Qadeer Khan managed to
steal highly classified nuclear secrets while
working in Amsterdam. It was a theft that would
first shake Pakistan's Chagai Hills test site, and
ultimately the rest of the planet. Working for a
firm that contracted with Urenco, a
Dutch-German-British company that provides
uranium-enrichment services to nuclear power
plants, Khan had access to Urenco's secret
blueprints and manuals. He learned how to enrich
uranium in centrifuges to make fuel for nuclear
power plants but also for weapons. He took what he
learned back to Pakistan, enriched uranium at the
Dr. A. Q. Khan Research Laboratories, and helped
his country build its first nuclear bomb.

Last year, Khan confessed to selling his nuclear
know-how not only to Pakistan but also to North
Korea, Libya, and Iran. The New York Times called
his handiwork "the largest illicit nuclear
proliferation network in history." Khan and the
global nuclear black market he spawned are
directly responsible for the current standoff over
Iran's plans to build a centrifuge
uranium-enrichment plant. The United States has
charged that the facility, based on Urenco
blueprints, is not for peaceful purposes but for
building nuclear warheads. Now Pakistan has put
Khan under house arrest, but the company that
allowed the world's worst nuclear-security leaks
is prospering. U.S. energy companies have invited
Urenco to build the same type of
uranium-enrichment plant in New Mexico that Iran
wants, using a technology so dangerous that the
United Nations has proposed a worldwide five-year
ban on it so that better safeguards can be
implemented. Nonetheless, powerful politicians and
company executives are pushing for approval of the
United States' first centrifuge uranium-enrichment
plant, while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -
the agency responsible for licensing such
facilities - is ignoring both Urenco's past and
the UN's concerns about the technology's future.
The plant's boosters are perilously out of step
with a world fundamentally different from the one
that existed when the NRC was created from the
Atomic Energy Commission 30 years ago. Like cold
war-era schoolchildren crouching under their desks
for a duck-and-cover drill, believing that somehow
a little wood and metal would protect them in a
nuclear attack, they are relying on a licensing
process that ignores the grave reality of
21st-century threats.

When the first atomic bomb was detonated at New
Mexico's White Sands Missile Range in 1945, there
was a blinding burst of light followed by a deep
growling roar as the explosion mushroomed skyward.
The genie loosed that humid July morning - "a
great new force to be used for good or for evil,"
Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, of the Manhattan
Project, called it - has since circled the globe,
with the development of nuclear power succeeding
nuclear weapons.

In addition to the United States, there are now
six other documented nuclear states: Russia,
China, France, United Kingdom, India, and
Pakistan. North Korea's status is uncertain, and
Israel is thought to have nuclear weapons but has
not admitted it. Several other nations, including
Iran, are feared to possess the technology to
build nuclear bombs. (Before the 1991 Gulf War,
Iraq was also a threat, as was Libya, until it
handed over its technology to the United States
last year.) Terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda
have called the acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction a "religious duty."

Though the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) has helped reduce nuclear arsenals and the
further spread of nuclear weapons, it is today
being tested as never before. One problem with
Iran's proposed enrichment facility is that,
unlike the older, gaseous-diffusion technology to
enrich uranium, centrifuge plants can be much
smaller and use much less energy, making them
harder to detect. Centrifuge plants, of which
there are only a handful worldwide, can also be
easily and covertly retooled to produce
weapons-grade uranium, the key component in
nuclear warheads. Once you have the centrifuge
equipment in place, says Ivan Oelrich, an expert
on proliferation for the Federation of American
Scientists, all you have to do is "adjust the
piping of the centrifuges" to further enrich
fuel-grade, which contains 3 to 5 percent of the
uranium isotope 235, into bomb-grade, which is 90
percent U-235.

The "dual use" potential for centrifuge
uranium-enrichment facilities is the basis for a
1983 call by the prestigious Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute for a
worldwide, permanent ban on centrifuge technology.
But the technology continues to be attractive to
the nuclear power industry. The two
gaseous-diffusion plants operating in the United
States use massive amounts of electricity. With
the much more efficient centrifuge technology,
costs of nuclear-reactor fuel production could
come down exponentially.

If price and efficiency were the only factors,
centrifuge uranium-enrichment would be a
no-brainer. Unfortunately, according to Matthew
Bunn of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs, it's also "the technology
of choice for the determined nuclear cheater and
people with few scruples."

In 2001, A. Q. Khan was interviewed at his home in
Islamabad for John Friedman's 2002 documentary
Stealing the Fire. He spoke calmly about his role
as the "father" of Pakistan's bomb, defending his
thievery as a necessary means to protect his
country. The interview is chilling - all the more
so because the nuclear secrets Khan stole are
unrecoverable. "Today, people including President
Bush say that the Khan network is finished,"
Friedman told me. But they don't understand that
Khan set up an ongoing procurement system. "The
technology is out there, and as long as there are
buyers, there are sellers."

Of course New Mexico isn't Iran or North Korea.
Presumably safeguards will be in place that would
make U.S. technology less vulnerable. But plans
and materials could still be stolen, as they were
in Amsterdam. Moreover, if "responsible" nuclear
states like the United States insist on using
centrifuges to enrich uranium for their nuclear
power plants, why shouldn't Brazil - which
reportedly got the technology from the West German
branch of Urenco in the 1970s, in violation of the
NPT - or Iran, or any other aspiring nuclear
state? If centrifuges become the technology of
choice for nuclear-reactor fuel, it will be
impossible to prevent the technology's spread.

The $1.2 billion New Mexico project is proposed by
Louisiana Energy Services, a consortium made up of
Westinghouse, Entergy, Exelon, Duke Energy, and
Urenco, the latter of which owns a 70 percent
share and possesses the classified information
necessary to build the plant. LES vice president
Rod Krich, "on loan" from Exelon, claims that the
facility poses no proliferation threat. "We have
agreed to IAEA safety inspections," he says,
referring to the UN's nuclear watchdog, the
International Atomic Energy Agency. "And we have
designed the plant so that it's impossible to
enrich the uranium to weapons- grade." The plant
could be retooled to produce highly enriched
uranium, of course, but that's not what its
critics are worried about. The problem is that no
one knows whether the 21st-century Urenco has
plugged its security leaks.

"[Urenco's] technology was stolen a long time ago
and a lot has changed since then," says Bruce
Moran, an NRC staffer who monitors international
nuclear safety. When asked to explain exactly what
Urenco had done to ensure that its classified
nuclear secrets were secure, a Urenco spokesperson
told me that since the New Mexico plant will be an
"LES enrichment facility," I would need to speak
with LES (even though, according to an LES
spokesperson, the centrifuges will be assembled
on-site by Urenco security-cleared contractors). I
then asked LES vice president Marshall Cohen what
had changed since A. Q. Khan's day to close
security loopholes. Cohen didn't know offhand but
repeatedly assured me, in calls, by e-mail, and in
person, his company would provide an answer. It
never did.

The UN's proposed five-year moratorium on the
construction of centrifuge uranium-enrichment
facilities is an effort to stop the threat of what
a UN commission has called a "cascade of
proliferation." The idea has been praised from
quarters as unlikely as the conservative National
Review magazine, never a fan of the UN. "It buys
the world time to reevaluate the effectiveness of
the current set of nuclear rules," wrote Henry
Sokolski, executive director of the Washington,
D.C.-based Nonproliferation Policy Education
Center in the January issue. Given the European
leaks that unleashed the nuclear genie in
Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea, Sokolski
emphasized that all states, not just "trouble
states like Iran," should honor the moratorium.

Louisiana Energy Services has tried and failed
twice before to build a uranium centrifuge
facility in the United States. Low-income
communities, first in Louisiana and then in
Tennessee, needed the jobs but not the radioactive
waste or airborne toxics produced by the facility,
and ran the consortium out of town.

The third try may be the charm. In Hobbs, New
Mexico, a boom/bust oil town of 28,000, the public
is noticeably absent from February public hearings
before the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, which will recommend whether to license the
LES plant. City officials are solidly behind the
idea, and local residents are desperate for new
jobs. "Very few people have gone to these public
hearings," says Rose Gardner. "They trust our
leaders to make the right decisions." Gardner, 46,
owns Desert Rose Flowers and Gifts in the tiny
town of Eunice, 20 miles from Hobbs and 5 miles
from the proposed site. On the first day of the
weeklong hearings, she and retired Hobbs
businessman Lee Cheney are the only members of the
audience not associated with either the media or
LES.

Each morning of the hearings, Gardner makes the
trek from Eunice to Hobbs, shuttering her flower
shop the week before Valentine's Day, her busiest
season. "When I heard about the plant, I went to
the LES office and asked for more information.
They treated me like an imbecile. That was a
mistake." Gardner has a soft voice and a powerful
Tex-Mex accent. She's more soccer mom than
rabble-rouser, but in 2004, when she began getting
bits and pieces of news about the company that
wanted to come to Eunice, something didn't sit
right. When she couldn't get the information from
LES, she went online. "I typed 'uranium
enrichment,'" she says. "That's when my education
began."

The drive between Eunice and Hobbs is flat and
empty but for scrub mesquite, pump jacks, and gas
storage tanks. The air is often thick with
hydrogen sulfide, released when methane is pumped
out of the wells. "It's why we're called the
armpit of New Mexico," Gardner says with a crooked
smile. "It smells like rotten eggs." Her father
was a roustabout in the oilfields that encircle
Eunice. Born and raised there, Gardner was a
pumper for a while with Conoco and married a boy
who had lived so close to her growing up that she
"could throw a stick at him anytime I wanted to."
She and her husband raised two daughters. The
Gardners and the other 2,700 residents of Eunice
are bookended by Dynegy natural-gas processing
plants on the north and south sides of town. At
the town's center flies a massive American flag;
it could easily envelop the average Eunice home.
Gas flares in the hazy distance lend a sci-fi aura
of a ruined future. Yet Gardner loves where she
lives. "It's all I know," she says. Gardner went
to her city council representatives and politely
suggested they show up and get an education at the
Hobbs hearings. Her husband, a city council member
himself, has frequently been subjected to her
chastisements about getting involved; she's on a
mission and family members aren't exempt.
"Proverbs 25:15 says patient persuasion can break
down the strongest resistance and can even
convince rulers," she says.

Gardner has environmental concerns about the
facility, "but proliferation is the most important
thing," she tells me one afternoon as we drive
from Eunice along a section of highway that's been
"adopted" by Warren Petroleum. "Homeland Security
is constantly telling us to be prepared, be ready,
and yet my little town is welcoming a company that
possesses the very technology that terrorists
want. In all good conscience, I can't welcome this
plant. I don't know where else it can go, but I
know I don't want it here."

The NRC's three-member panel spends the week
listening to expert testimony, asking tough and
technical questions of witnesses on both sides of
the issue. Their queries involve everything from
whether there are interconnected geologic
fractures that would spread contaminated material
into underground waterways to whether the company
has a safe way to dispose of its radioactive
waste. (The board will release its findings on
these environmental issues in June.)

"It's a great process," says LES's Krich, adding
that he's satisfied "all the important decisions
are being addressed." But legal proceedings last
year limited what could be discussed at these
hearings. Two proliferation issues were ruled
out-of-bounds by the NRC: the advisability of
allowing Urenco to operate on U.S. soil, given its
security lapses; and whether having a larger
domestic fuel supply would slow U.S. efforts to
deal with the huge stockpiles of weapons-grade
uranium in Russia. That nation has 600 tons of
poorly secured nuclear material, and Russian
officials reported four incidents of "terrorist
reconnaissance" of the stockpiles in 2001. Since
1993, the United States has been buying Russia's
stockpiles, supplying it with needed currency
while removing a sought-after ingredient for
terrorists bent on nuclear mayhem. The Bush
administration has acknowledged the importance and
success of this program, calling it "a key element
of U.S. nonproliferation policy." Dubbed "Megatons
to Megawatts," it's also an excellent source of
reactor fuel. Just as uranium can be enriched, the
process can work the other way as well:
Weapons-grade uranium can be "downblended" to
create the less potent uranium used in reactors.

Lindsay Lovejoy, a Santa Fe attorney representing
two Washington, D.C.-based groups, the Nuclear
Information and Resource Service and Public
Citizen, contends that the LES plant would slow
Russia's stockpile reduction, since there would be
less demand for Russia's product. Other experts
aren't so sure. Harvard's Matthew Bunn, for one,
says that New Mexico's current plans "are modest
compared to the scale of Russia's stockpiles. From
a nonproliferation point of view, it's not a huge
problem if New Mexico goes ahead with the plant."
Each year, Russia provides 5.5 million "separative
work units," or SWUs, of low-enriched uranium to
the United States; LES would produce 3 million
SWUs. Bunn adds, however, that there might be a
problem if both LES and a similar centrifuge plant
proposed for Piketon, Ohio, were green-lighted.

Where the truth in this debate lies is apparently
irrelevant to the NRC. In opening remarks to the
panel, Lovejoy was forced to reduce his arguments
on the Urenco and Russia connections to two
sentences: "There are matters of the highest
national importance, including the proliferation
impact of this facility, that can't be addressed
here but that should be," Lovejoy warned. "I hope
someone is thinking about these issues." The
three-judge panel thanked him and moved on.

The NRC's decision to limit debate "was
disappointing but not surprising," says Amy
Williams, co-coordinator for Concerned Citizens
for Nuclear Safety in Santa Fe. "The NRC looks at
licensing issues in a very black-and-white way."
Proliferation is "outside the scope" of the very
agency with the power to approve nuclear-plant
licenses. The limiting of public debate has
troubled New Mexico governor Bill Richardson (D),
who released a statement last August criticizing
the agency's refusal to consider important issues
in the LES application, including "the adequacy of
proliferation safeguards related to foreign
ownership."

This Achilles heel worries Nuclear Information and
Resource Service executive director Michael
Marriotte as well. "The NRC doesn't have any
mechanisms set up to examine national-security
issues in this kind of context," he says.

The NRC's project manager for the New Mexico
plant, Tim Johnson, is impatient when asked to
explain the apparent lapse. Proliferation "has
nothing to do with the licensing for this
facility... it's not part of the decision that
we're making." He adds that if such issues were a
concern they would be investigated by the
Department of Energy as part of the NRC's
licensing process. Yet the DOE has already
expressed its support for the LES plant. "They
said it was in our national interest to have
another [enriched uranium] supply located in this
country," Johnson says.

"The trouble with secrecy is that it denies to the
government itself the wisdom and the resources of
the whole community." - J. Robert Oppenheimer,
father of the atomic bomb, 1955

Though proliferation is off the table in the LES
bid, the NRC has shown an interest in homeland
security - but in ways that have infuriated
opponents of the plant. For example, the company
was allowed to argue at the hearing that it would
provide domestic "energy security," protecting the
country in the event of disruptions of foreign
fuel supplies. (Never mind that LES is merely the
American face of a company dominated by
foreign-owned Urenco.)

Homeland security has also been invoked to hide
frightening facts. Announcing that it needed to
screen for "terrorist-useful information," last
October the NRC shut down public access to most of
the documents on its Web site - many of which
contained information relevant to the LES license
application. Representative Edward Markey
(D-Mass.), a member of both the Energy and
Commerce Committee and the Select Committee on
Homeland Security, immediately questioned the
move. In a letter to the NRC's chair, Markey
wrote, "I am concerned that the Commission may now
be using security as an excuse to further erode
the public's right to find out about and
participate in the Commission's activities."

Says the NRC's Johnson, "The potential for
terrorism justified removing [certain] material,"
adding that information was scrubbed that might
have helped terrorists "identify where they could
do the most damage."

"That's a bunch of baloney," says Don Hancock,
director of the Southwest Research and Information
Center's nuclear-waste program. The missing files
included floor plans and accident analyses,
"including such 'terrorist-related' activities as
the impact of an earthquake," he says. The
now-absent material also noted that if a rail
accident involving a shipment of radioactive waste
from the facility occurred in an urban area,
approximately 28,000 people could suffer adverse
health effects, and if an accident involving
uranium hexafluoride gas occurred on-site, there
would be at least seven "latent cancer fatalities"
from exposure.

Peter Brand is an investigator with the Project on
Government Oversight, a watchdog group in
Washington, D.C. "It's safe to say that, like most
government agencies, the NRC overdoes the 'we need
this to be secret to keep you safe' thing," he
says. "Those 19 guys on September 11 weren't using
specific information on Web sites. They just cased
security and figured out what they could do." Adds
Hancock, "If on the one hand LES is not a
dangerous facility, then it's of no use to
terrorists." If it is dangerous, "they should
legally and morally tell the public what the real
risks and impacts are."

In December the NRC ruled that if outside groups
want to see the uncensored documents, they will
have to sign confidentiality agreements promising
not to disclose the information. (Though some
expert witnesses have signed the agreements in
order to prepare their testimony in opposition to
the LES facility, no one else has yet signed away
their freedom of speech to gain access to what
until a few months ago were public documents.)

According to Hancock, the NRC is focusing on the
wrong threats and ignoring the most salient
national-security issues. So is Congress.
"Congress is taking a basically hands-off
approach; that LES is a private enterprise and
under NRC jurisdiction so there's no point in
intervening," he says. To the degree that there
has been intervention, it has been boosterism on
the part of Pete Domenici (R-N.Mex.), the powerful
chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources. In 2003, the senator pledged to
aid LES by working "at all levels to help get
through the long permit and regulatory process."
He then praised LES partner Urenco and its history
of uranium enrichment in Europe. Of Urenco's past
performance, he added, "We can expect as much
here."

Domenici inserted language into the Energy Policy
Act of 2003 that would "limit the consideration of
need" for uranium-enrichment plants to whether
they would advance both energy security and "the
deployment of advanced centrifuge enrichment
technology." He also added wording that speeds up
the application process for such plants to no more
than two years, and forces the U.S. government to
take responsibility for the facility's radioactive
waste. The energy bill will most likely be
resubmitted in 2005.

Arizona's Republican senator John McCain was
outraged by the action. "[It] would suspend
important environmental reviews to facilitate the
construction of uranium-processing facilities in
New Mexico," McCain said, and added, "Even more
disturbing, . . . Urenco has been associated with
leaks of uranium-enrichment technology to Iran,
Iraq, North Korea, and Pakistan."

Senator Domenici is an old friend of the energy
industry. He was the top Senate recipient of money
from electric utilities (which include nuclear
power plants) during the 2002 election cycle.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics,
he received more than $175,000 from electric
utilities alone, and more than $400,000 from the
energy and natural-resources sector overall.

In interviews with the Santa Fe New Mexican,
Domenici has expressed a desire to create a
"nuclear corridor" along a 60-mile stretch of the
Texas-New Mexico border, where radioactive waste
dumps and the LES facility would support existing
nuclear power plants and new plants around the
country. Though no new nuclear power plants have
been ordered since 1978, plans are now in the
pipeline to relicense 18 reactors at 9 power
plants nationwide. The LES centrifuge project
would fuel the renaissance. "American utilities
are fully supportive," says LES's Cohen. "We
already have sales contracts, even though we're
years from being able to provide enriched
uranium."

Plant executives, and even the NRC's point people,
talk about energy security, but they are really
focused on what the New Mexico plant will do for
the nuclear power industry. So focused, in fact,
that they refuse to acknowledge what it could do
for nuclear proliferation. With regard to the
moratorium proposed by the UN's International
Atomic Energy Agency, they simply argue that the
United States is exceptional. LES executives Cohen
and Krich as well as the NRC's Moran and Johnson
each assured me individually that the United
States would be exempt. "The IAEA has stated that
[the moratorium] proposal is not intended to cover
countries, such as the U.S., that already have
enrichment capabilities," says Cohen.

In a piece written for London's Financial Times
shortly before the New Mexico hearing, however,
the IAEA's director general, Dr. Mohamed
ElBaradei, stated unequivocally that all countries
should honor the moratorium, which would present a
rare opportunity to cool tensions with Iran. (The
proposal will be debated during a May meeting at
the United Nations to review the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.)

"The [United States] seems to have a double
standard; it is determined to have other
governments bend to its will when it comes to
proliferation but is not willing to accept the
same standards for itself," says Lawrence Wittner,
a professor of history at the State University of
New York, Albany, and author of the 2003 book
Toward Nuclear Abolition. "The view that there are
evil nations and virtuous ones scraps the earlier
universalistic aspects of nuclear arms control and
disarmament."

Three international crises of the Bush presidency
- Iraq, North Korea, and Iran - were all fueled by
fears of centrifuge programs. Remember those
aluminum tubes? Vice President Dick Cheney argued
for an invasion of Iraq based on outdated
information that Saddam Hussein was "trying,
through his illicit procurement network, to
acquire the equipment he needs to be able to
enrich uranium." Iraq's weapons program - based on
centrifuge information reportedly provided by
German scientists who had worked for a Urenco
subcontractor - had been set back at least a
decade by the Gulf War. Iraq posed no imminent
nuclear threat. But there are other Saddams, who
would like nothing better than to get their hands
on nuclear warheads. It would be tragic if the
smoking gun - the proof that there is no fail-safe
way to use centrifuge enrichment technology - came
in the form of a mushroom cloud.

Chief of U.S. Geological Survey resigning
ASSOCIATED PRESS

9:08 a.m. June 10, 2005

LAS VEGAS Ð The U.S. Geological Survey director
criticized since the disclosure that several
agency scientists might have falsified documents
about a planned Nevada nuclear waste repository is
stepping down.

Charles G. Groat's resignation, announced Thursday
in Washington, D.C., was not connected with the
Yucca Mountain project, survey spokeswoman A.B.
Wade said.

Groat will return effective June 17 to the
University of Texas at Austin, where he once
served as an associate geology professor and
acting director of the Bureau of Economic Geology.

Interior Gale A. Norton praised Groat, who has
headed the USGS since November 1998, for applying
USGS science "to supporting important decisions
regarding resource and environmental management
and policy."

Groat has been under fire since he and Energy
Secretary Samuel Bodman announced in March the
discovery of e-mail messages written by USGS
hydrologists between 1998 and 2000 discussing
possible falsification of quality assurance
documents on water infiltration research they did
for the Yucca Mountain project.

The disclosures sparked ongoing investigations by
Energy Department and Interior Department
inspectors general, aided by the FBI, and by a
U.S. House subcommittee headed by Rep. Jon Porter,
R-Nev.

Nevada lawmakers have criticized Groat for not
taking immediate disciplinary action against the
hydrologists, who remain at the agency, and for
not turning over requested documents.

Groat expressed support for investigations to
clear the USGS, which he said had a 125-year
reputation for sound, unbiased science.

The Energy Department plans to seek a license from
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to entomb 77,000
tons of the nation's most radioactive waste at
Yucca Mountain. Congress in 2002 approved putting
the repository at the site 90 miles northwest of
Las Vegas.

A date for opening the repository has been pushed
back from 2010 to 2012 or later following a
federal court ruling that an Environmental
Protection Agency radiation standard was
insufficient, congressional budget cuts and the
e-mail revelations.

John Arthur, a top Yucca Mountain project
official, reported this week that the Energy
Department has tentatively concluded that
repository science was not compromised by the USGS
scientists.

Groat will be the Jackson Chair in Energy and
Mineral Resources in the School of Geosciences at
the University of Texas, the Interior Department
said. He also will direct the school's new Center
for International Energy and Environmental Policy.

Energy Wars:
Return of the Navajo
Navajo Nation Bans Mining, Processing
Of Uranium On Navajo Land

By Nathan Diebenow
Associate Editor

CRAWFORD Ñ Indians still exist, but more importantly, theyÕre flexing their muscles.
The U.S. energy industry suffered a blow in late April when Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley, Jr. signed the Din Natural Resources Protection Act which bans the mining and processing of uranium on Navajo land as well as re-enforces the sovereignty of the Navajo people.
The DNRPA is designed to protect the water resources of the Navajo Nation, as well as the health of its citizens, 15,000 of whom are residents in the Church Rock-Crownpoint region of New Mexico.
ÒI donÕt want to subject any more of my people to exposure to uranium and the cancers that it causes,Ó Shirley said during the signing ceremony before about 50 people who had gathered in the Crownpoint Chapter House.
ÒAs long as there are no answers to cancer, we shouldnÕt have uranium mining on the Navajo Nation,Ó he added. ÒI believe the powers that be committed genocide on Navajo land by allowing uranium.Ó
President Shirley was referring to over half a century of unexplained cancers and other health effects due to his people mining the radioactive ore on their land for the energy industry, as well as for U.S. governmentÕs nuclear weapons arsenal.
Despite the few Navajo who stood to gain income from the mining of their land allotments where ore is located, the reservation has overwhelmingly supported the Act. The Navajo Tribal Council, in fact, voted 63-19 on April 19 to approve the prohibition, sponsored by George Arthur (Burnham/San Juan/Nenahnezad), chairman of the Resources Committee.
ÒMembers of these communities have already given enough lives to the uranium industry. New mining, whether it be conventional or ISL, would likely devastate a new generation of Navajo citizens,Ó said New Mexico Environmental Law Center Staff Attorney Eric Jantz in a written statement.
ÒDozens of communities have passed resolutions declaring their opposition to new uranium mining, and thousands of Navajo have signed petitions against new mines,Ó he continued. ÒWe and our clients applaud the Navajo Tribal Council for exercising its inherent sovereignty to protect its valuable resources and the health of its citizens.Ó
Officials for Hydro Resources Inc. cried unfair for not receiving as much face-time as the Eastern Navajo Din Against Uranium Mining to explain the mining process with the Council. However, HRI has tried to gain federal permits for the last decade to begin in-situ leach uranium mining southwest and east of Crownpoint and uranium processing north of the defunct United Nuclear CorporationÕs uranium mill.
Activists said that saving the quality of their drinking water and air is more important than the price of uranium, which has more than doubled over the past two years, from less than $10 per pound to over $23 per pound. HCI is a subsidiary of Dallas-based Uranium Resources Inc.
The Law Center added that this victory is significant because earlier this year the Nuclear Regulatory Commission okayed HRIÕs license for the first of its four proposed mine sites around Church Rock and Crownpoint.
That being said, HCI might still challenge in federal court the right to mine on allotments on the grounds of the definition and scope of what constitutes Navajo land.

Human Experimentation
The Navajo ban of uranium mining has both important social and historical significance as well, because for over 80 years, Navajo miners and their communities have suffered the effects of radiation poisoning under close watch of the U.S. government.
Since 1920, the tribe prior to exposure to uranium radiation was also exposed to radium from mining the ore on their reservation. Four inactive uranium mill sites and over 1,200 abandoned uranium mines are on the reservation. Most of these mines are unreclaimed.
The largest quantities of uranium were mined in the Four Corners area where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah converge. The Navajo reservation itself is equal to the size of West Virginia and home to 275,000 of the 350,000 people scattered around the world.
According to Din (the name of the Navajo people use for themselves) linguists, uranium is known as ÒleetsoÓ Ñ meaning yellow brown or yellow dirt. From this dirt, the first atomic bombs were developed at the secret Manhattan project in Los Alamos, N.M., and tested at the Trinity Site at Alamogordo, N.M. The Din mined more than 13 million tons of uranium ore from their land to the U.S. between 1945-1988, according to Jaime Chavez, organizer for the Water Information Network.
ÒDuring the 1940s-80s, there were a lot of open pit uranium mines and a huge flux of cancers happening. The widows were coming together saying, ÔWhatÕs going on?Õ They made the connection that all the husbands had worked in the uranium mine, and sure enough, they were,Ó said Lori Goodman, treasurer of the nonprofit, activist group Din Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment (CARE).
As more and more miners came forward with their stories, Goodman said, the U.S Congress passed the Radiation Compensation Act in 1990. Under this Act, the U.S. government was supposed to compensate individuals with diseases from exposure to radiation connected with the federal governmentÕs nuclear weapons testing program. The Act was also designed to compensate the medical costs attributed to the lung cancers of Navajo uranium miners exposed to radiation on the job in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, or Wyoming from 1947 to 1971. <www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/>
ÒWe all thought it was taken care of, but we were also seeing that our elders who were never uranium miners were also dying of the same cancers as the uranium miners. They lived off the land. We were asking questions of the public health officials. We were going into communities, and what came out was that the uranium miners were supposed to get compensated, and they werenÕt. At that point, politics took over,Ó said Goodman.
The Act, it was found, discriminated against the very people it was trying to help. For instance, Goodman said, Òlaws said that you have to have a marriage certificate in order to be eligible to receive this compensation, and our people back then had traditional marriages. They didnÕt have marriage licenses. They were being eliminated right there, and there were questions of cultural significance to smoking. The government officials would ask them, ÔDo you smoke?Õ And without the proper interpretation, it was taken as they were smoking cigarettes when in fact the miners were talking about ceremonial smoke that you donÕt inhale. ItÕs done once or three times a month. So they were automatically eliminated, put off the record.Ó
As a result of community activism, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced an amendment of 1990 RECA, S.1515., in 2000, that added the mill workers who processed the ore to the qualification list; expanded the diseases, which were mostly cancer and respiratory illnesses; and expanded the geographic coverage for Òdownwinder claims.Ó The bill also lowered the radiation exposure thresholds for eligibility for more individuals on the reservation.
Unfortunately, the RECA 2000 bill President Clinton signed was an unfunded mandate. Uranium miners were given IOUs, the RECA Trust Fund was empty, and RECA regulations were not written on time. No one so far has been compensated under 2000 RECA, even after a lawsuit was filed against U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft which charged that the Department of Justice failed its obligation to implement RECA regulations within 180 days of the amendmentÕs enactment.
Shockwaves ran through the Navajo reservation again when in February 1995, the Department of EnergyÕs Office of Human Radiation Experiments published Human Radiation Experiments: The Department of Energy Roadmap to the Story and Records. The Roadmap exposed the U.S. governmentÕs role in conducting and sponsoring Cold War human radiation experiments, some of which included Navajo uranium miners.
ÒThey would find out how long it would take these miners to get cancer and then from that point in time find out long they would die,Ó said Goodman, referring to the U.S. government. ÒAt the same time the government was telling us that they didnÕt know that radiation was harmful, so they were blameless was what they were trying to say.Ó

2005 Energy Bill
ÒAs soon as President Bush came into power, he wanted to start uranium mines again, and in fact with his first energy bill, he had $30 million for energy companies to start uranium mining again. ItÕs in this one again,Ó said Goodman referring to latest energy bill drafted by House Energy Committee Chairman Joe Barton (R-Texas).
Goodman referred to the House energy bill as the Òdark sideÓ version, Òwith every tax credit for industry, every restriction on environmental protection, every means possible to make it possible to extract energy resources Ñ no matter what the people think or what the impacts might be.Ó
Goodman noted that the Senate energy bill, which hit the floor this Monday, is Òless destructive than the House version;Ó however, both the Senate and House bills, she said, contain similar so-called ÒIndian energyÓ sections. ÒThey try to encourage energy production on Indian lands by getting the tribal governments to develop their own sets of rules. Then the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) can just rubber stamp approval of individual projects that are developed under those rules. It will make it harder for communities, groups or individuals to challenge decisions under federal environmental and cultural protection laws.Ó
As one lawyer used by Din CARE noted in an email to The Lone Star Iconoclast, ÒIn addition, Title V of H.R. 6 could remove the application of federal laws, such as NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, from energy development decisions on tribal lands.
ÒThe bill affects land both on and off reservation. It provides that once the Secretary of the Interior approves a tribal energy resource agreement providing a process for making energy development decisions, individual energy projects would proceed without federal approval,Ó he continues. ÒSince no federal action would occur, the existing guarantees of environmental review and public participation under NEPA would be lost. Concerned tribal community members and communities adjacent to the project would lose the mechanism that they have now to make their voices heard.Ó
In other words, the Bush Administration is moving lock-step with the philosophies of globalization and the free market by removing any and all governmental regulations and safeguards that protect the community interests, agreed Goodman. When asked if she thought it would be fair to compare the plight of the Navajo with its uranium mines to the Venezuelans with their oil reserves with regard to U.S. foreign policy, Goodman said, ÒThat is very accurate. We all remember how U.S. removed (President Hugo) Chavez. But the community united brought Chavez back.Ó
Goodman added that a few tax credits for building renewable energy production are included in the House bill, but both versions fail Òto emphasize energy conservation as a way to increase our ÔsecurityÕ or Ôenergy independence.Õ Everything is focused on producing more energy.Ó
Joan Claybrook, Public Citizen President, responding to the House Energy and Commerce CommitteeÕs draft energy legislation in a statement, said, Ò(This bill) offers more of the same failed proposals that have doomed energy legislation in the past two Congresses. It showers nuclear and oil companies with subsidies, gives polluters a break from protecting the environment and promotes further electricity deregulation while doing nothing to protect consumers from high energy prices.Ó
Claybrook noted that oil prices continue to soar despite Congress passing a billion-dollar subsidy in October 2004 to encourage more domestic energy production and its March 16 budget vote to open AlaskaÕs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. ÒYou would think that such a radical change in federal oil production policy (the successful Senate vote represented the first time in 24 years that the Senate has approved the measure) would send a clear signal to oil traders in New York,Ó she said. ÒBut the prices of oil and gasoline have only skyrocketed since the vote, raising doubts about the claim by the Bush administration and Congress that giving energy producers what they want will somehow lower prices for consumers.Ó

Coal Plants
There will be a potluck and rally on this Saturday, June 18, at Shiprock Park in Shiprock to help stop the proposed Desert Rock Power Plant in the Four Corners area.
According to Din CARE in a letter to the editor of The Albuquerque Tribune, three Navajo chapters (Burnham, Sanostee and Two Grey Hills) have passed community resolutions directly opposing the plant. Other chapters (Newcomb and Sheep Springs) are making motions to officially oppose it as well, the letter said, jointly written by Anna Marie Frazier, Din CARE Coordinator, and Sarah Jane White, Dooda (No) Desert Rock Committee President (Burnham/Sanostee Chapters).
ÒAll but one of the local communities oppose the power plant. Our people living in this area suffer rates of asthma, reproductive disorders, cancer and other illnesses that are far in excess of national averages,Ó said the letter. ÒDo you really imagine the communities are going to vote for more pollution and its associated destruction?Ó
Proposed by Sithe Global, LCC, of Houston, Desert Rock is a coal-fired plant that would emit 3,400 tons of mercury and ozone into the air. The plant is planned to use a hybrid dry cooled coal-fired electric power-generating technology, south of Farmington in northwestern New Mexico. The project development agreement was entered into with Din Power Authority (DPA), an enterprise of the Navajo Nation.
The Navajo, however, are expected to not see one watt of energy from this plant due to the agreement, although 80 percent of the tribal revenue comes from coal royalties and tax. About one billion ton of coal reserves are within the tribal lands. Two coal fired power plants (Four Corners and Page) and three mines (Peabody, BHP, and PNM). Total permitted for mining is 95,724 acres and total disturbed is 16,767 acres.
Goodman said that probably 30 percent of Navajo donÕt even have electricity. Their primary source is wood and also some use coal. The Navajo people are not so reliant on these plants for jobs either, she said.
ÒI wouldnÕt say very much. I mean, I have nine brothers and sisters. None of them work for any energy company on Navajo land. There arenÕt that many jobs. Peabody Coal Company has 50 employees,Ó she said. ÒWhen you factor in how much is the community benefitting. Are we getting any return? When you factor those in, those 50 people that work there, thatÕs nothing because all the energy goes off the reservation.
There are two other power plants already in the area from which the Navajo people have received negative health consequences. Goodman said that 40 years ago when the Four Corners Power Plant, which is one of the biggest polluters, Peabody failed to live up to its promises to make life easier for the people.
ÒThey were saying that if you move, weÕll build you a new house. ÔWeÕll make sure you have electricity and water in your homes,Õ Goodman said. ÒWell, 40 years later, they are still living the same way they did, and so the community is saying, ÔHey, weÕre not going to be fooled the second time around.ÕÓ
Goodman added that the landscape is a bit ironic: the Navajo homes, many of which use solar power panels, are located right next to the transmission lines leading from the plant. ÒItÕs really quite the picture Ñ families with no electricity and no running water, and they have just one panel of solar that they use and in the background are these huge shovels and drag lines coming toward their homes. ThatÕs the picture,Ó she said.
A draft of the environmental statement has yet to be released, probably at the end of the summer or the fall, said Goodman. ÒThey are planning that it will all go through, and theyÕll start to build in 2006, and the plant will be in operation in 2008.Ó

In The Name Of Sovereignty
When asked of the other challenges facing the Navajo people, Goodman said, ÒItÕs funny you should ask. ItÕs like an energy war happening here now. With Bush and with ChaneyÕs secret meeting with the energy cartel, theyÕve sliced up Indian lands here. ItÕs very interesting in who all is investing in these projects.Ó
The U.S. government under the Bush administration, as well as the U.S. energy industry, has changed its tactics and language to compel the Navajo and other Native Americans to secure natural resources from their native lands. ÒNow they are talking about giving in the name of sovereignty: ÔWe want the Indian people to decide for themselves. We want them to make their own environmental laws,Õ said Goodman. ÒIt is like they only recognize our sovereignty when they put toxic waste on our lands, and then when we go out to fish and hunt for ourselves then our sovereignty is not recognized. In the name of sovereignty they put in the Four Corners Power Plant.Ó
ÒOnce you turn it over to the Indian people, then the federal government canÕt come in,Ó she added. ÒIt allows the energy companies to come in and just wreck the place, and we canÕt make them clean up. They wonÕt clean up. ItÕs not in the name of self-determination. It really is termination. They donÕt want to be responsible and at the same time, the time is right for the companies to come in and rape the land with no legal recourse. They are not responsible.Ó
Goodman said that the healthcare costs for treating the symptoms of air and water pollution are Òkilling us.Ó In Shiprock, N.M., there are two power plants nearby. ÒShiprock is sort of like in a bowl, and the pollution just hangs there. The asthma and upper respiratory problems are sky high,Ó she said. ÒTheyÕre taking the healthcare monies and giving it to the corporations to poison us to death,Ó she said.
This past March, the Republicans defeated $1 billion for Indian health, housing and education, Goodman said. The Navajo NationÕs Indian Health Service is currently 55 percent funded and the vacancy rate of doctors and nurses is 20 percent, she added.
ÒWe live in scary times, just because for an administration that really harps on Christian values thatÕs certainly not reserved for all people, they have no knowledge of history Ñ nuclear testing again Ñ and that is scary,Ó she said.
Goodman said she doesnÕt know if the tribal government can stand up to the multinational corporations or the U.S. government because Òthey have to be thinking about not pissing them off.Ó However, she still has hope.
ÒItÕs going to take citizen activism to fight off the energy companies, and people have done that before and they are ready to do it again. It has to be done because what we learned from doing the RECA, itÕs only shame in the eyes of the world is what makes them back off, so thereÕs a need to be as public as possible for whatÕs taken place,Ó she said.
ÒWe had some major projects that weÕve accomplished that gives me hope. What it really is is that they donÕt really know what weÕre going to do. TheyÕre so set in what people with money do to protect themselves that they donÕt know what people without money do.Ó
Goodman said that Din CARE is continuing to build coalitions working on similar issues with Anglo activists like the San Juan Citizens Alliance. ÒWe understand that race is always used to divide us,Ó she said.
ÒWeÕve learned something from working in the uranium mines. Right now we have asthma. WeÕre not willing to project all that garbage on our children. No way. ItÕs the stand people are making right now,Ó she added.

Are we ready to respond?
Local agencies detail response in event of accident involving radioactive waste

Wally Kennedy
Globe Staff Writer
6/12/05
Print this story

What would happen if a truck transporting nuclear
waste were to crash at Interstate 44 and Range
Line Road ?

The answer might be surprising in that local
emergency responders would only do two things:
Cordon off the area, then dial a special 24-hour
emergency-response telephone number.

Though the Joplin Fire Department, the primary
responder to such incidents, has training in the
containment of hazardous and radiological
materials, the department would simply isolate the
truck and wait for a team of radiological
specialists to arrive.

Last week, the first of 2,000 shipments of
radioactive waste rolled through Joplin on
Interstate 44 on its way to temporary storage in
Andrews County, Texas. As many as 15
tractor-trailers will pass through Joplin each
day. The waste is from the site of a Cold War
uranium refinery in Fernald, Ohio.

The concern, of course, is what might happen if
one of the tractor-trailers were to be involved in
an accident. Accidents involving big trucks do
happen.

In 2003, there were 17,923 accidents involving
tractor-trailers on Missouri highways. On
Missouri's interstate highways in 2003, there were
4,214 accidents alone, according to the Missouri
State Highway Patrol.

Lt. Tim Hull, spokesman for the patrol at
Jefferson City, said the steel canisters of waste
being transported from Ohio have low levels of
radiation.

"It's not even comparable to the material hauled
away from nuclear power plants, which are highly
radioactive," he said. "These shipments won't even
come close to that."

Contingency plans

Each of the flatbed trucks will carry two steel
canisters, each weighing 21,950 pounds.

The canisters contain uranium residues, fly ash
and portland cement. When combined, they form a
solid concrete monolith. About 70 to 83 percent of
the material in each container is non-radioactive,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The
department is overseeing the shipments.

Still, the waste is of some concern because it is
radioactive. Standing close to one of the
containers during shipment might be equivalent to
getting a medical X-ray, according to the Nuclear
Information and Resource Service in Washington,
D.C.

Keith Stammer, the new emergency coordinator of
Joplin-Jasper County Emergency Management, said
the public should use what he calls the "thumb
rule" with regard to the shipments.

"If you stick your arm out and hold up your thumb
and if your thumb does not cover (the view of it),
you are too close - just back up."

He said that the primary responsibility for a
hazardous-material response belongs to the Joplin
Fire Department.

"As the local agency, their job is protection of
the populace," Stammer said. "Their main job would
be to cordon off the area. No one goes in and no
one goes out."

He said state environmental officials would be
notified, along with the carrier and the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE).

"We have a number to call them. They have the
primary responsibility for response. They have the
contingency plans for cleanup and recovery," he
said. "By and large, our main task would be to
contact the appropriate people upstream."

Stammer said he was contacted late last week by
the state Emergency Management Agency that the
radioactive shipments from the former uranium
refinery in Ohio would pass through Joplin. When
he received word of that, he notified the
emergency-response agencies along "the prescribed
path, which is Interstate 44, in the county."

Also getting notification from the state agency
was Gary Roark, director of Newton County
Emergency Management.

"I notified the Redings Mill Fire Protection
District. It is our only fire department along
Interstate 44 in that area of the county," he
said. "They would cordon off the area. They are
not trained to do anything with it. They would
wait for a hazardous-materials response unit to
respond."

Roark said none of the emergency-response units
along the route would be able to handle the costs
associated with an appropriate response.

"The cost would be fantastic," he said. When it
comes hazardous material shipments, it is the
transporter's responsibility for costs incurred in
a cleanup. That's state law."

A physical hazard

Jeff Wagner, spokesman for Fluor Fernald, the
contractor responsible for the cleanup of the
uranium refinery in Ohio, said the Fernald Closure
Project provides a detailed briefing to the driver
before the shipment departs the plant.

The briefing stresses response actions to take in
the event of an accident or severe weather, and
the requirements for remaining on the designated
route.

The project also requires the carriers to utilize
a satellite-tracking system for each shipment and
has made arrangements with the carriers to access
the system to randomly verify that the carrier is
adhering to the assigned route.

All drivers are provided with a 24-hour, toll-free
number to call in the event of an incident. In
addition, a DOE radiological response team is also
available. Such teams must be deployed within four
hours of notification.

The Fernald site has radioactive waste stored in
four 75,000-gallon tanks. The plant began
operating in 1952, producing high-purity uranium
for national defense programs. It closed in 1989.

The waste is being shipped under contract with
Visionary Solutions, based in Oak Ridge, Tenn.

Tri-State Motor Transit Co., based in Joplin and
one of the leading carriers of hazardous and
nuclear wastes in the nation, has hauled for the
company in the past and could be called again,
said David Bennett, a vice president at Tri-State.

"They have approved us, but we don't have a
contract with Visionary Solutions, which is acting
as a third-party contractor," he said. "We could
certainly do the job."

If the company is planning to make up to 15
shipments a day, that would mean there could be 45
to 60 tractor-trailers on the job each day. Some
would be returning to Ohio empty. Some would be
loading and offloading, while others would be in
transit with the radioactive material.

"The worst-case scenario would be for one of the
trucks to roll over," Bennett said. "It's the
physical hazard, not the radioactive hazard, that
is the concern. Because of the weight and shape of
the material, the concern is center of gravity for
turning over.

"Since it's a solid material, it cannot become
wind borne and it cannot affect water."

Bennett said Tri-State, which started carrying
radioactive materials for the federal government
in 1945 for the Manhattan Project, has had only
two accidents involving radioactive materials.

"We have never had a release of radioactive
material," he said. "But we have had two wrecks
that I am aware of. In one, a truck rolled over on
a snow bank. The other involved an accident with a
car."

Bennett said Tri-State's experience with
radioactive material helped "write the book on how
to handle spent nuclear fuel."

"The truth is, I agree with Adam, I mentioned the

Adam writes:
"I believe everyone is making this issue a bigger
deal than it needs to be. I believe some thing
should just be kept quiet. If no one would have
said anything,no one would have known the trucks
were even passing through. All stories like this
do is cause panic for some. I think it's good that
the proper authorities are aware, but we dont need
to make it the center of conversation for days.
And if this is all we,(as in the fourstates) have
to write about then we need to dig a little
deeper. Surely there is some positive news out
there somewhere. I know I am one of many people
who is sick and tired of reading and watching all
negative news. Rememeber the old saying "what we

Steve writes:
"It seems to me, the Globe has a love for being
melodramatic. I would advise them to start writing
down UN and NA numbers on the sides of trucks and
rail cars that pass through Joplin everyday,
others don't believe me, should do the same. If a
UN number is present, the material is hazardous.
There are resources to deciper the number and to
obtained the MSDS. I must ask the Editor, why do
you not write about the far more dangerous
materials that pass through Joplin each day,
materials that if involved in a accident may cause
more than a signficant evacuation of a surrounding
area. I believe the answer is this, the other very
hazardous materials that flow through the area, do
not cause the stir anything associated with RAD
waste might. It does not seem to matter some of
the other chemicals could cause an immediate major
disaster, serious injuries and even death, it just
seems to matter what stirs the pot the most. Do

Final shipment of pit waste leaves Fernald site

Associated Press

CINCINNATI - The last rail car of radioactive
waste that had accumulated in storage pits
throughout the Cold War left a former uranium
processing plant in southwest Ohio on Wednesday,
managers of the Fernald Closure Project said.

The last shipment was the 154th trainload of pit
waste removed from the site 18 miles northwest of
Cincinnati. Moving the waste to an Envirocare site
in Utah began in April 1999.

"What took three decades to fill took us just over
six years to eliminate," said project director
Jamie Jameson.

The Fernald plant processed and purified uranium
for use in reactors to produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons from the 1950s until 1989. During
that time, nearly 1 million tons of waste was
generated and stored in six pits.

Some low-grade wastes are to be permanently stored
at Fernald. The first of an expected 2,000
shipments of higher-grade radioactive waste from
Fernald's silos, combined with fly ash and
concrete, left for a storage site in Andrews,
Texas, earlier this month.

Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists, which won
the $7.5 million contract in late April to store
the waste, also has applied to the Texas
Department of State Health Services for a license
to handle disposal.

Shipments of the estimated 45,000 tons of silo
waste should be completed within nine or 10
months, said Jeff Wagner, spokesman for Fluor
Fernald, the company hired by the government to
manage cleanup of the site.

Dredging done at Fernald waste pits

By Dan Klepal
Enquirer staff writer
ADVERTISEMENT

CROSBY TWP. - The largest job in the $4.4 billion
cleanup of radioactive waste at Fernald is
finished.

The dredging of the so-called waste pits - six
vast dumping grounds equal to a 10-acre,
42-foot-deep hole at the Cold War-era uranium
foundry - is complete and the last shipment of
material left by rail Wednesday for a disposal
site in Utah. The waste pits became a graveyard of
sorts for every kind of chemical and radioactive
byproduct produced at the plant during four
decades of operation.

There were rumors from retired workers about
entire pieces of machinery buried in the waste
pits. No machinery was unearthed, but nearly 1
million tons of material was dug up, dried in an
enormous furnace, and shipped off the site by
train since April 1999 - the largest rail
transportation project in U.S. Department of
Energy history.

"We had a train leaving every two weeks, and it
ran like clockwork," said Jamie Jameson, president
of Fluor Fernald, the government contractor
performing the cleanup. "And that was a big part
in building public confidence in our ability to do
the cleanup."

The waste pits represented a $400 million project
within a project. It was the biggest part of the
overall environmental restoration of the
1,050-acre site. Other projects include cleaning
the aquifer, removing mountains of contaminated
soil, demolishing numerous buildings and other
structures, along with removing waste from three
concrete storage silos.

The waste from the storage silos - the
most-radioactive material at the site - has
recently begun being trucked to Texas for
disposal.

"They did extremely well," citizen watchdog Lisa
Crawford said of the waste pits project. "It was a
long, hard haul. Years ago, we were very skeptical
because they had never done anything like this by
rail. The light at the end of the tunnel is
getting brighter."

Contaminated soil still must be removed from the
pits - about a three-month job. The area will then
be tested to make sure radiation levels are low
before it is turned into a wetland area.

The Battery That Truly Keeps on Going
June 20, 2005
Consulting-Specifying Engineer
http://www.csemag.com/article/CA609565.html

Using some of the same manufacturing techniques
that produce microchips, researchers have created
a porous-silicon diode that may lead to improved
betavoltaics, according to the National Science
Foundation, which partially funded the research.

A direct energy conversion (DEC) cellÑalso called
a betavoltaics-based ÒnuclearÓ batteryÑis not only
microscopic in size, but also could run for more
than a decade on the electrons generated by the
natural decay of the radioactive isotope tritium.
Such devices convert low levels of radiation into
electricity and can have useful lives spanning
several decades.

While producing as little as one-thousandth of the
power of conventional chemical batteries, the new
"BetaBattery" concept is more efficient and
potentially less expensive than similar designs
and should be easier to manufacture. If the new
diode proves successful when incorporated into a
finished battery, it could help power such
hard-to-service, long-life systems as structural
sensors on bridges, climate monitoring equipment
and satellites.

The battery's staying power is tied to the
enduring nature of its fuel, tritium, a hydrogen
isotope that releases electrons in a process
called beta decay. The porous-silicon
semiconductors generate electricity by absorbing
the electrons, just as a solar cell generates
electricity by absorbing energy from incoming
photons of light.

Supported by grants from the NSF Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program, a
multi-disciplinary team of researchers from the
University of Rochester, the University of
Toronto, Rochester Institute of Technology and
BetaBatt, Inc. of Houston, Texas, describe their
new diode in the May 13 issue of Advanced
Materials.

Researchers have been attempting to convert
various types of radiation into electricity since
the development of the transistor more than 50
years ago. Mastering the junctions between
relatively electron-rich and electron-poor regions
of semiconductor material (p-n junctions) led to
many modern electronic products.

Yet, while engineers have been successful at
capturing electromagnetic radiation with solar
cells, the flat, thin devices have been unable to
collect enough beta-decay electrons to yield a
viable betavoltaic device.

The BetaBatt will not be the first battery to
harness a radioactive source, or even the first to
use tritium, but the new cell will have a unique
advantage: its half-millimeter thickness. This
structure vastly increases the exposed surface
area, creating a device that is 10 times more
efficient than planar designs.

ÒThe 3-D porous silicon configuration is excellent
for absorbing essentially all the kinetic energy
of the source electrons,Ó says co-author Nazir
Kherani of the University of Toronto. Instead of
generating current by absorbing electrons at the
outermost layer of a thin sheet, surfaces deep
within these porous silicon wafers accommodate a
much larger amount of incoming radiation. In early
tests, nearly all electrons emitted during the
tritium's beta decay were absorbed.

There were a number of practical reasons for
selecting tritium as the source of energy,
particularly safety and containment, says
co-author and patent holder Larry Gadeken of
BetaBatt.

ÒTritium emits only low-energy beta particles
(electrons) that can be shielded by very thin
materials, such as a sheet of paper,Ó says
Gadeken. ÒThe hermetically sealed, metallic
BetaBattery cases will encapsulate the entire
radioactive energy source, just like a normal
battery contains its chemical source so it cannot
escape.Ó

Even if the hermetic case were to be breached,
adds Gadeken, the source material the team is
developing will be a hard plastic that
incorporates tritium into its chemical structure.
Unlike a chemical paste, the plastic cannot not
leak out or leach into the surrounding
environment.

Researchers and manufacturers have been producing
porous silicon for decades, commonly used for
antireflective coatings, light emitting devices
and photon filters for fiber optics. However, the
current research is the first patented betavoltaic
application for porous silicon and the first time
that 3-D p-n diodes have been created with
standard semiconductor industry techniques.

ÒThe betavoltaic and photovoltaic applications of
3-D porous silicon diodes will result in an
exciting arena of additional uses for this
versatile material,Ó says co-author Philippe
Fauchet of the University of Rochester. ÒThis is
the first time that uniform p-n junctions have
been made in porous silicon, which is exciting
from the point of view of materials science.Ó

For example, because of its characteristics and
photon sensitivity, each diode pore could serve as
an individual detector, potentially creating an
extremely high-resolution image sensor.

ÒThe ease of using standard semiconductor
processing technology to fabricate 3-D p-n
junctions was surprising,Ó adds co-author Karl
Hirschman of the Rochester Institute of
Technology. That manufacturing ease is an
important breakthrough for increasing production
and lowering costs, and it makes the device
scalable and versatile for a range of
applications.

ÒThe initial applications will be for remote or
inaccessible sensors and devices where the
availability of long-life power is critical,Ó says
Gadeken.

The BetaBattery may prove better suited to certain
tasks than chemical batteries when power needs are
limited. The structures are robust, tolerant to
motion and shock, and functional from -148¡F
(-100¡ C) to 302¡F (150¡C)Ñand may never have to
be changed for the lifetime of the device.

Uranium revival excites industry veterans

By JEFFREY JACQUET
Star-Tribune correspondent Sunday, June 26, 2005
Casper, Wyoming

LARAMIE -- It is a radioactive metal with a funny
name that is fetching 20-year-high prices,
reopening mines across the West and catching the
attention of everyone from Wyoming mining veterans
to Wall Street stockbrokers.

It was back in the 1970s when uranium last
garnered this much interest, back before the Three
Mile Island accident, and back when more than
5,000 Wyomingites had jobs extracting the
yellowish, radioactive ore from the ground.

Now a number of Wyoming industry analysts and
veterans -- many of whom began their careers
during the uranium heyday -- say they are excited
as high prices and global demand are likely here
to stay.

They also say Wyoming -- already the nation's top
uranium producer -- is in an excellent position to
reap the rewards of this upward trend.

"This is very definitely an exciting time," said
Robert Maxwell, a Casper-based consulting
geologist for the industry. "We are looking at a
long-term trend (in prices) based on a number of
long-term factors."

Maxwell is helping organize the upcoming Global
Uranium Symposium, set for Casper July 11-13,
which he says will help showcase the state's
attributes.

"Wyoming is in a very good position," he said.
"Wyoming and Texas are the most likely areas in
the country for upgrading current operations and
beginning new (operations)."

Ray Harris, a senior staff geologist and uranium
expert for the Wyoming Geological Survey, agreed,
explaining the Cowboy State's reserves are not
only the nation's largest, but also the most
accessible.

"The advantage is that Wyoming's proven reserves
can be mined by in-situ methods, where other
reserves (in other states) have to be mined by
conventional means," Harris said. "So our
production is more accessible and more
environmentally friendly. And these will be the
districts of the most interest."

Harris, an industry veteran who will publish a
memoir on the history of Wyoming's uranium
industry later this year, said interest in the
metal is greater than he has seen in decades.

"Just this year, I've had a lot of people in this
office asking about Wyoming uranium," he said.

In the past few months alone:

-- Riverton-based US Energy Corp. announced it
will reopen the Sheep Mountain mine near Jeffrey
City.

-- CAMECO announced it will expand uranium
production at its Smith Ranch-Highland mine north
of Douglas.

-- COGEMA Inc. is restoring its Irigaray and
Christensen mines near Kaycee.

-- Canada-based Energy Metals Corp. acquired and
plans to develop the Nine Mile Lake uranium
deposit north of Casper.

-- Canadian-based Tournigan Gold Corp. acquired
uranium deposits in the Great Divide and Shirley
basins.

Uranium fever has even begun to sweep Wall Street,
where two new uranium investment funds have
emerged to immediate success, as the price of
uranium has doubled in the last 18 months.
Investment advice articles with titles such as
"Why we are buying uranium stocks" have started to
sprout up in the business press.

It's unlikely that the uranium mining industry in
Wyoming would match the other extraction
industries in dollars or jobs anytime soon.
According to the Wyoming Mining Association's Web
site, in 2003 the uranium industry employed 120
workers in Wyoming, while coal production employed
more than 4,700.

Nevertheless, when all the effects on employment
are tallied -- ranging from geologists to dump
truck drivers -- the impact could still be
substantial.

"All the geologists are tied up right now," said
Robert Odell of the Rocky Mountain Uranium Scout.
Odell, who has been a Wyoming uranium geologist
for more than 51 years, will present a history of
Wyoming's uranium industry at the Casper
Symposium.

"There are a lot of young companies trying to buy
up land here and set up shop," he said.

Some have wondered if Wyoming has enough uranium
milling capacity to remain competitive -- uranium
ore must be processed to produce uranium oxide, or
"yellowcake" -- but Harris said milling problems
are "happening all across the country" and Wyoming
is no worse off than any other state.

The Ônew' nuclear

Charles Mason, a University of Wyoming professor
of economics who wrote his dissertation on the
uranium industry bust in 1983, explained that it
is a slow-moving industry dependent on long-term
forecasts and trends.

"My impression is what's driving the optimism is
the expectation ... there will be a global,
large-scale push into alternative kinds of power,"
Mason said. "We could be seeing a kind of sea
change (in energy use), and if that happens it
could really radicalize the market."

The price of uranium plummeted in the 1980s, as
nuclear power became politically unfavorable,
while the price bubble of the '70s caused an
excess supply. But in today's world of global
warming, nuclear energy is seen around the world
as becoming once again in vogue.

Electricity from nuclear reactors produces no
carbon dioxide, and nuclear power advocates
contend that troubles containing harmful
radioactive waste and reactor meltdowns are
problems of the past.

President Bush recently called nuclear power "one
of the safest, cleanest sources of power in the
world," and nuclear power is even being heralded
as "the new green energy" by a number of European
environmental groups.

"It's kind of thrilling to know industrial nations
are beginning to realize they can cut down on CO2,
and still keep the industrial base," said Odell,
echoing Mason's assessment. "Uranium is here to
stay. All the developing nations are trying to get
to where we are, and we're going to need all the
power sources we can get. It's such a cheap source
of power."

Austin Chronicle
June 30 2005

---  Senate Natural Resources tackled their own
nuclear option Monday, as Robert Duncan,
R-Lubbock, laid out SB 39, which "transfers
jurisdiction over the disposal of all radioactive
waste," minus radioactive oil and gas nasties, "to
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality."
Why? According to Duncan, it's required to "deal
with the 11(e)(2) waste [uranium ore enrichment]
coming in from Fernald, Ohio," courtesy of major
Perry donor Harold Simmons' Waste Control
Specialists. WCS was granted its money-minting
permit in February, when the company was allowed
to import the toxic slough of uranium enrichment
leftovers. WCS's facility, west of the small city
of Andrews, sees two truckloads of the stuff
weekly, WCS attorney Mike Woodward said to the
committee. "They're not fully at liberty to
discuss their contracts," said Woodward when asked
about them, yet he estimated WCS' windfall at $7
million for storage and $9 million for disposal,
"from what I've read in the papers." The Sierra
Club's Ken Kramer supported transferring authority
to TCEQ, and SB 39's taxation of importers. Other
provisions, however, accelerate the permitting
timeline, limit the duration of contested case
hearings, and, most ominously, allow uranium
mining permit holders to conduct "minor" mining
without additional permitting or hearings. Ð Wells

Nuke waste compact hears plea from Butte and weighs own future


By EMILY FREDRIX
Associated Press Writer

June 29, 2005

A Butte official asked for up to $5 million
Wednesday as reimbursement for the protracted
fight against building a dump for radioactive
waste near the tiny village.

The money would come from a $141 million
settlement Nebraska is set to pay the Central
Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact
Commission next month.

The settlement ended an appeal of a decision in
which U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf of Lincoln
ruled that former Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, now a
U.S. senator, engaged in a politically motivated
and orchestrated plot to keep the dump from being
built in Nebraska.

The dump would have housed low-level waste from
Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana Oklahoma and Nebraska,
although Nebraska lost its membership last year.

Cindy Schroetlin, the mayor of the village of 370,
asked the panel for between $4 million and $5
million, though she said there was no way to know
how much money the town had lost during the
15-year fight.

Many businesses that supported the facility went
under because of boycotts prompted by the
commission's decision to build in the northern
Nebraska town, she said. One of those businesses
belonged to her husband, a longtime mayor of the
town, she said.

"How do you put a dollar amount on revenue lost to
businesses and revenue townspeople would have
sustained?" Schroetlin said.

She said Butte put $500,000 into water facilities
to prepare for the site.

Schroetlin estimated the town would have received
about $2 million a year over the life of the
facility in tax revenues, had it been built.

The commission took no action on the request and
another similar request by a second resident.

Laura Gilson, chairman of the committee and the
commissioner from Arkansas, said the panel also
needed to find a solution between two extremes:
finding another site or disbanding the compact
altogether.

The commission called for a special public meeting
July 14-15 in Little Rock, Ark., to discuss the
matter.

Even as its future was unknown, the commission
entertained ideas of what to do with the money it
expects to receive in a little more than a month.
The panel listened to presentations by investment
consultants but delayed further decisions until
its future is more certain.

"We want to do the most responsible, most prudent
thing with respect to handling this money while we
make decisions about our uncertain future," Gilson
said.

The panel also said it was still deciding whether
to store some of its waste in Texas, which has
approved private low-level waste management
facilities, or to use EnviroCare, a
waste-management company based in Utah.

Congress ordered states in 1980 to build their own
dumps or join regional groups to dispose of the
waste, which includes contaminated tools and
clothing from nuclear power plants, hospitals and
research centers.

Before that, Nevada, South Carolina and Washington
had accepted low-level radioactive waste from the
rest of the country but grew tired of it in 1970.

In 1987, the Central Interstate compact voted to
put its waste in Nebraska. Both sides took the
fight to court on several issues.

No compact has yet to build a dump.

Colorado's Plutonium Trigger Plant Morphs to Wildlife Refuge

DENVER, Colorado, June 27, 2005 (ENS) - The Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons factory that once drew
10,000 people to protest demonstrations is being
converted into a wildlife refuge. The U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service Wednesday published the final
Comprehensive Conservation Plan for the site 16
miles northwest of Denver, although cleanup of
radioactive contamination is not complete.

The final plan is the Service's proposal for
management of the site for 15 years, starting when
the refuge is established - sometime between 2006
and 2008.

Rocky Flats is a 6,240 acre former nuclear defense
facility operated by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE). From 1952 to 1989, Rocky Flats manufactured
nuclear triggers, or "pits," small, hollow spheres
made from plutonium.

In 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats site
changed from weapons production to environmental
cleanup and closure. No longer needed for nuclear
weapons production, the site is left with a legacy
of contamination that includes spills of
plutonium, tritium and other radioactive
materials.

triggers were manufactured there. (Photo courtesy

All weapons manufacturing was performed in a 600
acre area in the middle of the site known as the
Industrial Area. But radioactive groundwater and
airborne dust have spread the contamination beyond
that weapons production area.

Contractor Kaiser-Hill is responsible for site
cleanup, and on June 1 demolition began for the
last plutonium building at Rocky Flats.

The Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board says the
remaining risk at the site now centers on
protection of surface water leaving the site. Soil
and groundwater cleanup projects are underway to
accomplish this risk reduction.

Three passive groundwater treatment systems to
address groundwater contamination are now
operating. "Other groundwater contamination areas,
primarily in the former Industrial Area of the
site, also need to be addressed," the Board says.

Additional cleanup projects will include
addressing the two former onsite landfills and
areas of surface soil contamination.

"The successful decontamination and demolition of
the major plutonium production facilities must be
done carefully to prevent air dispersion of
contamination that might be embedded in these
facilities," the Board says.

The DOE says cleanup is taking place in accordance
with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement under
oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment. Overall cleanup of the
site is being done to meet a standard that will
one day protect the health and safety of a future
wildlife refuge worker.

The amount of soil contamination decreases at
greater distances from the plant. The soil
contamination off site of Rocky Flats is too low
to impact public health or the environment, and
does not require removal. That conclusion was
reached in 1996, by the DOE, the EPA and Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment after
years of environmental studies.

The Fish and Wildlife Service says it "understands
that some members of the public remain
apprehensive about potential public use at Rocky
Flats National Wildlife Refuge due to the siteÕs
history."

In the Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) the
Service says public concerns about the safety of
the refuge will be addressed by providing "clear
information that educates visitors about access
restrictions and public use opportunities" at all
trailheads.

The Service says personnel will work with the DOE
to develop signage and fencing or another means of
boundary demarcation to clearly identify all areas
that will be retained by DOE and are closed to
public access.

contains the most plutonium. Here, in 2002, crews dismantle 903 Pad.

The Rocky Flats site consists of prairie, wetlands
and upland shrubs. The CCP emphasizes wildlife and
habitat conservation with what the Service calls
"a moderate amount of wildlife-dependent public
use."

Refuge wide habitat conservation will include
management of native plant communities, weeds,
restoration tools, removal and revegetation of
unused roads and stream crossings, management of
deer and elk populations, prairie dogs, and
protection of Preble's meadow jumping mouse
habitat.

Visitor use facilities will include about 16 miles
of trails, a visitor contact station that is
staffed on a seasonal basis, trailheads with
parking, and developed overlooks.

Most of the trails will be located on existing
dirt and gravel roads. All trails will be open for
hiking, and some will also accommodate bicycle and
equestrian use. Under the CCP, the Service will
develop a limited public hunting program.

To determine whether deer taken by hunters would
be too radioactive to eat, tissues from Rocky
Flats resident deer were analyzed and compared
with control deer from another Colorado wildlife
area.

Andrew Todd and Mark Sattelberg of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service conducted the study on tissue
collected from 26 deer on the Rocky Flats site
that were culled in December 2002 to test for
chronic wasting disease. None had the wasting
disease.

In 2004, frozen tissues from these deer were sent
for analysis to the General Engineering
Laboratories in Charleston, South Carolina to be
tested for plutonium, uranium and americium.

Based on the lab results, the scientists found
calculated a one in 14.7 million increased chance
of cancer resulting from the ingestion of the deer
muscle, eaten, for instance, as deer steak or
stew.

If this same individual consumed similar deer
tissue every year throughout a 70 year life span,
he or she would risk a one in 210,000 increased
chance of cancer, Todd and Sattelberg calculated.
These levels fall within the EPA's acceptable risk
range.

Over the last few years the majority of the
plutonium stockpile at Rocky Flats was shipped to
the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Other
materials were sent to the Pantex facility on
Texas and to facilities in Tennessee. Some of the
leftover plutonium was declared a waste, treated
and packaged for shipment to the Waste Isolation
Plant in New Mexico.

Thousands of cubic yards of wastes at the site
must still be shipped away. Some of the waste was
left over from the weapons production era, but
most of it is being generated during the site's
cleanup as buildings are torn down and soil
contamination is addressed.

"Some types of waste do not yet have a disposal
location designated or available," says the Board.
"These orphan wastes must be addressed if the site
is to successfully close."

In 1989, Rocky Flats was added to the National
Priorities List for Superfund, the national
environmental cleanup program. There are areas oat
Rocky Flats where chemicals and nuclear materials
were buried, contaminating both the soil and
groundwater. Various spills and other accidents
over the years also have caused contamination.
grass

Rocky Flats (Photo courtesy DOE)
In the late 1990s, Rocky Flats was added to a list
of accelerated closure sites by the Department of
Energy. Funded by a special appropriation from
Congress, these sites receive priority funding.
For the last several years, Rocky Flats' annual
budget has averaged $650 million per year. Funding
will continue at this level until the cleanup
project is complete. Completion is scheduled for
2006.

While the formal planning process has concluded,
the cleanup of Rocky Flats is ongoing. Transfer of
the site from the Department of Energy to the
Service will not occur until the federal and state
environmental agencies certify that the DOE has
completed the cleanup and closure.

Public use facilities and programming will be
phased in over the 15 year life of the CCP. During
the first five years of refuge management, the
Service says it will concentrate efforts on
habitat restoration and weed control, and provide
only limited public access.

Rocky Flats is located 16 miles northwest from the
center of Denver, and nine miles southeast of the
city of Boulder. Numerous suburban communities are
very close to Rocky Flats, including Arvada,
Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Lafayette,
Superior, Thornton, and Northglenn. The closest
residence near Rocky Flats is within two miles.

Within a 50 mile radius of the Rocky Flats site
reside the 2.2 million people of the eight county
Denver metropolitan area.

Currently the site is surrounded by open space,
but population pressures mean increasing
residential and commercial development near the
facility. The Citizens Advisory Board estimates
that by the year 2015 the population within a 10
mile radius will grow from the current number of
10,000 to 24,000.

Radioactive shipments pick up pace
By Elizabethe Holland
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
06/30/2005

By now, dozens of shipments of radioactive waste
were to have passed through the area on their way
from a Cold War-era uranium processing plant in
Ohio to a temporary storage site in west Texas.

Instead of dozens, though, only five shipments
have made the 1,300-mile trek.

Jeff Wagner, a spokesman for Fluor Fernald, the
contractor in charge of the move, said the company
isn't yet satisfied with the composition of the
waste for all the shipments. The shipments contain
blends of radioactive waste, cement and fly ash,
which are to be stored in an estimated 4,000
half-inch-thick carbon steel containers. Wagner
said he expects it will take another three weeks
to get the blend - described as having the
consistency of loose grout - to the desired
condition for all shipments.

"They really are working to get the most amount of
waste in each of the containers and still meet our
radiation levels for over-the-road shipping,"
Wagner said. 


By this point, Fluor Fernald had expected to be
sending out 15 trucks a day - each carrying two
20,000-pound containers of waste - seven days a
week. Instead, one shipment went out June 6, two
went out June 19, and another two left Sunday,
Wagner said. Those shipments met the company's
standards, he said.

"Any time you start a facility, it's just going to
take a little while until you can actually ramp up
to your optimal output," said Wagner, who said
plans call for six trucks to be sent out Sunday
and eight trucks July 10.

Despite the delays, Wagner said, Fluor Fernald
still hopes to have all of the waste in Texas by
the end of the year.

Because Fluor Fernald is behind in its shipments,
construction-related traffic jams on Interstate 44
east of Cuba haven't created a situation requiring
rerouting, said an official with Visionary
Solutions LLC, the Oak Ridge, Tenn.-based company
that is transporting the waste.

Construction crews are replacing pavement on nine
miles of eastbound I-44, from 1.2 miles east of
Highway F to just west of Highway H in Cuba. The
work is expected to continue into next month.

Both issues - the composition of the shipments and
the potential traffic problems - are further proof
for Kay Drey, a local activist and board member of
the Washington-based Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, that the waste shouldn't be
moved yet.

"What's the rush?" said Drey, of University City.
"They've had this stuff there for 50 years.
Shouldn't it be done safely - if it can be done
safely?"

More than half of the waste came from the
Mallinckrodt Chemical Works on the riverfront just
north of downtown. Mallinckrodt changed the course
of World War II by developing a way to purify
uranium to the grade needed to make the atomic
bomb.

After the war, 6,000 tons of radioactive
byproducts from the processing were shipped to the
uranium processing plant in Fernald, northwest of
Cincinnati. In cleaning up Fernald, the U.S.
Department of Energy chose a temporary site in
Andrews County, Texas, at which to store the
waste. The site is owned by Dallas-based Waste
Control Specialists, which is licensed to hold the
waste for two years but is seeking a change in its
license that would allow it to permanently dispose
of the waste.

The Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club has
appealed a licensing change that allowed for the
shipments. The hearing for that appeal is
scheduled for July 11.

House member plans measure to speed opening 
Nevada nuclear dump

ASSOCIATED PRESS

LAS VEGAS (AP) - A key House lawmaker said he
plans to introduce a comprehensive nuclear waste
bill in the fall that could speed the opening of a
national radioactive waste repository in Nevada.

House Energy Committee Chairman Joe Barton,
R-Texas, told the Las Vegas Sun in an article
Wednesday that his measure could mandate a
10,000-year radiation standard for the Yucca
Mountain project.

Barton said he may also include a plan for storing
radioactive waste at temporary storage sites while
Yucca Mountain is being developed and give the
Energy Department more access to funds outside the
spending constraints of the annual congressional
budget.

All three of the proposals have been floated
previously by pro-Yucca lawmakers, with limited
success. They have drawn strong opposition from
Nevada lawmakers, who said they would again oppose
Barton's proposals.

Any new legislation designed to speed Yucca would
be "dead on arrival as far as we're concerned,"
said Jack Finn, spokesman for Sen. John Ensign,
R-Nev.

Since 1987, the nation's nuclear waste policy has
focused on developing an underground repository at
Yucca Mountain. President Bush and Congress
approved the site in 2002.

The program has been slowed in recent months by
budget shortfalls, controversy about scientific
research at the site and a crucial court ruling
last year on the radiation standard.

The proposal allowing Congress to set the
radiation rule would essentially negate the July
2004 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. It threw out the
10,000-year standard set by the Environmental
Protection Agency, forcing the Energy Department
to postpone plans seeking a license to operate the
repository. The EPA is expected to set a new
standard sometime this year.

Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said there was a
possibility the GOP-controlled Congress could
embrace the proposals.

But Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., said the House
Budget Committee has no appetite for giving the
Energy Department more control of the national
nuclear waste fund.

"It takes away our congressional oversight of
taxpayer-dollar expenditures, which no one
believes is a good idea," he said.

Nuclear industry leaders have said the proposal
does not strip away oversight, just artificial
annual budget caps.

Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., said changing Yucca
funding rules would be a "major step in the wrong
direction," at a time when "red flags" have been
raised about Yucca's viability as a repository
site.

Porter is leading a House investigation into
e-mails suggesting some quality assurance
documents relating to the project were falsified.

The Yucca site is expected to entomb 77,000 tons
of high-level commercial, military and industrial
radioactive waste now stored at sites in 39
states. Project planners have pushed back the
target for opening the repository from 2010 to
2012 or later.

Ark., three other states, not ready to give up nuke dump project
7/14/2005, 1:42 p.m. CT
By PEGGY HARRIS
The Associated Press	 	

LITTLE ROCK (AP) Ñ Representatives from four
states seemed ready Thursday to abandon two
decades of work to build a low-level radioactive
waste dump but keep intact their organization in
case public health and environmental problems
arise.

Delegates from Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and
Oklahoma expressed disappointment that their
efforts as the Central Interstate Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Compact has not produced a waste
facility as Nebraska, a former member, refused to
license a dump site in its northeastern corner.

Beginning a two-day meeting, they grappled with
questions about the compact's fate and a $141
million settlement the compact will receive Aug. 1
to settle the legal dispute with Nebraska.

"It's hard to admit defeat. It's hard to work on
something for a long time. You know, at what point
do you say 'Uncle?' said Catherine Sharp, the
compact commissioner for Oklahoma.

On the other hand, the delegates were encouraged
that the waste problem did not become as bad as
what was envisioned 25 years ago, when Congress
passed a law mandating states to form compacts and
build interstate dumps, and that advanced
technology has reduced the waste mass and now
disposes it more effectively.

"We've been struggling for 25 years to solve a
problem that never existed," Kansas commissioner
Joseph Harkins said. "The private system today is
meeting the demand, and there is no pressing need
for government intervention."

But none of the four commissioners seemed ready to
disband, saying it would be more practical to
scale down and remain prepared to respond if
necessary. They noted that nuclear power was
regaining public acceptance as an energy source,
especially in light of U.S. dependency on fossil
fuels and foreign oil. And changes in the
marketplace, they said, could make it difficult
for commercial operators to handle the waste.

A federal passed in 1980 law required states to
form regional compacts to dispose of their
low-level waste, such as tools from nuclear power
plants, needles from hospitals and clothing from
research labs, or be individually responsible for
the waste.

No compact to date has opened a regional dump and
the country's low-level waste is primarily handled
by private facilities in South Carolina, Utah and
Washington state.

The commissioners Thursday asked their consultant,
former Kansas commissioner and lawyer Jim
O'Connell, to draw up resolutions stating that the
compact would not use any of the $114 million
settlement to pursue building another waste dump;
would release some $10 million of the money to
utility companies and other waste generators that
was being held in escrow in case the four states
had successfully negotiated a compact arrangement
with Texas; and sell its 300 acres in Nebraska
that was to be used for a waste facility.

With the Central Interstate compact, formed in
1983, each member state has paid about $750,000,
while private companies have posted millions.
States and waste generators have contributed
nearly $89 million to the failed disposal facility
project in Butte, Neb., according to the compact
office in Lincoln, Neb.

Of that, the major generators and their estimated
shares of the total were Entergy Arkansas, 21
percent; Entergy Gulf States, 17 percent; Entergy
Louisiana, 16 percent; Nebraska Public Power
District, 16 percent, Omaha Public Power District,
13 percent; and Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating
Corporation, 17 percent.

In Arkansas, the state contribution came from the
Health Department budget. The Duratek facility in
Barnwell, S.C., handles much of Arkansas' waste.
But Gilson said it has been threatening to shut
down.

Los Alamos Bidding Closed
	

Two top teams of contractors are now officially 
bidding to run Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Auction closed. Bidding has ended for Los Alamos National Laboratory.
CREDIT: LANL

The $2.2-billion-a-year lab has weathered a string
of safety and management problems in recent years,
prompting congressional overseers in 2003 to force
the Department of Energy (DOE) to put the lab up
for bids for the first time (ScienceNOW, 30 April,
2003). The University of California (UC) has run
the storied facility ever since it opened in 1943.

As expected, the top teams submitting bids
yesterday were a partnership between UC and
facilities contractor Bechtel of San Francisco,
California, and a coalition headed by defense
contractor Lockheed Martin and the University of
Texas.

Lockheed announced that the University of Texas
component of its coalition will include a
consortium of university partners including the
University of Michigan and several other Texas
schools, added to bolster the team's academic
credentials. A number of weapons scientists had
expressed fears that giving control of the lab to
a corporate-minded group could put profit before
science or change the atmosphere. Others,
including powerful critics on Capitol Hill, say
that problems show UC should be replaced with more
responsible managers.

"I have every confidence we can help the
outstanding people at Los Alamos return their
laboratory to its rightful place as the nation's
and the world's premier science laboratory," said
Lockheed team leader Paul Robinson, former
director of Sandia National Laboratory in New
Mexico. Rounding out the Lockheed team are firms
CH2M Hill of Englewood, Colorado, and Fluor of
Aliso Viejo, California, specialists in plutonium
and facilities management, respectively.

UC's team reflects a desire to bolster the
university's management heft. The university has
added corporate contractors BWX Technologies of
Lynchburg, Virginia, and Washington Group
International of Boise, Idaho. Heading the team is
Michael Anastasio, director of Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California.

A partnership between two antinuclear
organizations, Nuclear Watch of New Mexico and Tri
Valley CAREs of Livermore, California, also bid
for the lab, though they are considered a long
shot. Even more groups may have bid, as DOE does
not have to release the names of bidders. Oral
presentations to DOE are expected in August with a
decision by the department expected by 1 December.

Headline News
Anti-nuke groups enter bid

JAYNA BOYLE, lareporter@lamonitor.com, Monitor Staff Writer

Two nonprofit organizations known as advocates for
Los Alamos National Laboratory worker health and
safety, the environment and nuclear
nonproliferation, formally submitted a joint bid
Tuesday to manage the laboratory, saying it should
be moved in a new direction, toward cleanup and
civilian science missions.

Nuclear Watch New Mexico and Tri-Valley CAREs
(Communities Against a Radioactive Environment)
submitted their management proposal to the U.S.
Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security
Administration office in Albuquerque.

On Tuesday, LANL's existing manager, the
University of California, partnered with Bechtel,
one of the world's largest construction
corporations, subitted a bid.

That team has named Michael Anastasio, current
director of the Lawrence Livermore Lab, also
managed by UC, as its designated director of LANL.

The other bidder Tueaday was Lockheed Martin, the
world's largest defense contractor, which has
partnered with the University of Texas.

That team has named C. Paul Robinson, ex-head of
Sandia National Laboratories, as its candidate for
LANL director. Lockheed already manages Sandia and
co-manages the British Nuclear Weapons
Establishment.

The Nuclear Watch New Mexico (NWNM) and Tri-Valley
CAREs (TVC) team is making its bid public in order
to help facilitate Los Alamos' recovery from its
various scandals, and to help direct the lab
toward meeting long-range national security needs
and challenge competitors.

"Our goal is to improve the lab contract
regardless of who is chosen to manage the lab,"
said Marylia Kelley, executive director of the
Livermore, Calif.-based Tri-Valley CAREs. "We feel
our proposed changes will help attract new, young
scientists."

Rather than naming individuals to specific
positions, NWNM/TVC proposes to radically revamp
the LANL management structure.

The change in direction flows directly from the
revamped structure.

Starting at the top, NWNM and Tri-Valley CAREs
propose to keep an overall lab directorship.

Attached to the director's office would be a chief
officer for whistleblower protection. Currently
eight associate directorships serve under the
director.

The organizations would transform threat reduction
into nuclear nonproliferation, responsible for
encouraging and verifying compliance with the
Nonproliferation Treaty at home and abroad.

Under that new associate directorship the
organization would subordinate nuclear weapons
programs, weapons physics, and weapons
remanufacturing.

This aligns with their proposed program of
maintaining (but not advancing) nuclear weapons
while they await dismantlement.

NWNM and Tri-Valley CAREs also plan to create a
new associate directorship for dismantlement.

They propose to elevate both environmental
restoration and science to new associate
directorships.

The former would expedite comprehensive cleanup at
LANL, in close cooperation with the New Mexico
Environment Department.

The latter would help restore "great science" at
the lab, with emphases on resolving pressing
national and international security needs such as
sustainable energy independence and addressing
global climate change.

"We want to try to use great minds for something
besides nuclear weapons," said Scott Kovac,
research and operations director for NWNM.

Kovac said under the proposed contract the
NWNM/TVC team plans to continue the existing
benefits and pay scale at the lab.

Jay Coghlan, NWNM executive director, said:

"In some cases we'll probably not see eye-to-eye
with the NNSA, particularly on nuclear weapons
programs.

"Nevertheless, we are hopeful that the agency will
see the soundness of our basic approach of truly
discouraging by concrete example the grave threat
of nuclear weapons proliferation. Combined with
the cost savings, diligence and integrity that we
will bring to lab management, we are confident
that the NNSA and the nation will be pleased with
our management sometime in the future."

Kelley said the NWNM/TVC contract proposal
emphasizes how the lab can meet emerging civilian
science needs.

Although NWNM/TVC are nonprofit organizations, the
team plans to voluntarily pay an estimated $80
million annually in New Mexico gross receipts
taxes, nearly half of which goes to public
education.

UC has not paid taxes to New Mexico in the past.

The NWNM/TVC bid and current and proposed LANL
management organizational charts are available at

Anti-nuclear bids for Los Alamos seek to change lab's mission

Associated Press
Jul. 20, 2005 01:50 PM

LOS ALAMOS, N.M. - Two anti-nuclear groups have
filed bids to run the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, with the aim of dismantling its
nuclear weapons research and turning the lab's
research program toward the environment.

Santa Fe-based Nuclear Watch of New Mexico and
California's Tri-Valley Communities Against a
Radioactive Environment submitted a joint 24-page
proposal Tuesday to manage the lab for the Energy
Department.

They suggested reversing direction for the lab
where the atomic bomb was developed 60 years ago,
turning its future toward research on
environmental restoration, renewable energy, green
manufacturing and combatting global warming.

The two major contenders for the contract - one
group headed by the University of California and
engineering company Bechtel Corp., the other by
defense contractor Lockheed Martin and the
University of Texas - also turned in management
bids. They submitted hundreds of pages of
materials.

The DOE is to hear oral presentations in August
and is expected to make its choice by Dec. 1.

The proposal from the anti-nuclear groups said
they believe all nuclear weapons activities
"should be conducted in a purely custodial role
while all nuclear arsenals await irreversible
dismantlement."

They wrote that the United States and other
signatories to the Nonproliferation Treaty made a
binding pledge to take steps toward nuclear
disarmament. The groups said it is in the interest
of national security to fulfill that pledge.

They also said the United States' lack of energy
independence threatens its national security.

The anti-nuclear groups' bid pledged to make the
lab more accountable to the public by increasing
protections for whistle-blowers, developing
community access programs and paying gross
receipts taxes to the state of New Mexico, worth
up to $80 million a year.

They said they would not seek to protect the lab
from penalties for violations involving
occupational safety, nuclear safety, security,
fiscal management and the environment. That
indemnification was allowed in the bidding
process.

Not in my backyard: Only three states will allow 
disposal sites for such waste

By Judy Fahys
The Salt Lake Tribune

SNOWBIRD - Three states had disposal sites for
low-level radioactive waste a quarter century ago.
And three states, including Utah, take the waste
now, even though two decades and $1 billion have
been spent to try to get more states to share the
burden.

For architects of the waste-management system, the
numbers amount to failure. They spoke about it
here this week at the 20th annual Low-level
Radioactive Waste Decisionmakers' Forum.

Ralph Disibio said he didn't realize a national
approach was needed until he got a call one day
saying a truck filled with radioactive waste had
caught fire at Beatty, Nev. Then head of Nevada's
health department, he had no idea that there was a
radioactive waste landfill in the state, let alone
that his agency was responsible for it.

Eventually, he organized the governors of the two
other states with sites to push for a national law
that groups states into 10 regions, each of which
was responsible for developing a site to serve
member states.

"In our minds, it was so simple," said Disibio,
retired after a career managing the nation's
biggest radioactive waste sites for private
contractors. But, in the end, the so-called
regional compact system unraveled as some states
resisted responsibility - even for waste generated
within their own borders.

"It became self-interest and not a regional
issue," he said.

Fast-forward to 2005. Governors in Nebraska killed
a site planned for central states' waste.
Political pressures drove the federal government
to block a land purchase needed for a proposed
California site. Legislators in Texas twice
rejected plans for a site in that state.

At one time, northeastern states talked about
buying the ghost town of Delle, Utah, about 70
miles west of Salt Lake City, for their site.

Beatty closed in 1993 because of leaks. That left
two low-level disposal sites in the compact
system: Barnwell, S.C., and in Richland, Wash.

Envirocare of Utah became a third facility


in 1988. Privately owned and operated, unlike the
South Carolina and Washington sites, Envirocare
gained an exemption from the compacts at the
behest of a state regulator who was taking money,
valuable coins and real estate from Envirocare's
former owner.

As the Barnwell site prepares to close to all but
a few states in 2008, Envirocare remains the only
disposal site for low-level waste from more than
30 states. And, thanks to a ban on "hotter," or
more radioactive, waste types in Utah, some
hospitals, universities and nuclear plants will
have no disposal for some waste in a few years.

The regional compacts "failed because political
leaders in some states were opposed to it
happening," said Ed Helminski, whose trade
newsletter hosted the meeting.

He said all eyes are on Barnwell as new
alternatives are being explored. Waste could go to
federal land already contaminated with radioactive
waste from defense programs, to Nevada, a proposed
Texas facility or even Envirocare, if waste limits
were to be lifted.

And maybe federal regulators will loosen
regulations so that some waste can go to hazardous
waste landfills.

"A lot of what-ifs," he said. "A lot of wishing
going on."

But not everyone is so pessimistic.

"We feel like we can work with the current
system," said Envirocare Senior Vice President Tim
Barney. "And we can work with a new system,
depending on how it was structured."

UTAH: RADIOACTIVE WASTE TO BE MOVED The Department
of Energy plans to move 12 million tons of
radioactive waste away from the banks of the
Colorado River, a major source of drinking water
for about 25 million people, officials said. The
waste is in a mound just 750 feet from the river
in southeastern Utah. Environmentalists have long
feared that it is leaching into the soil and could
eventually poison the water supplies of Las Vegas,
Los Angeles, Phoenix and other cities. The Energy
Department said it is to be moved mostly by rail
starting in 2007 to a proposed holding site near
Crescent Junction, Utah, at a cost of more than
$300 million. (AP)

Radioactive waste will be moved away from river

By MARK THIESSEN
Associated Press writer

SALT LAKE CITY -- More than 12 million tons of
radioactive waste will be moved away from the
Colorado River, which provides drinking water for
more than 25 million people across the West.

The Department of Energy on Monday said the
radioactive tailings about 750 feet from the river
near Moab in southeastern Utah will be moved,
predominantly by rail, to a proposed holding site
at Crescent Junction, Utah, about 30 miles from
the Colorado River.

"The only way we can look at this is good news,"
said Energy Department spokesman Mike Waldron. "We
have identified a solution that will help to
ensure the environmental quality of the region for
generations to come."

The department's decision was announced in the
final environmental impact statement for the
tailings site. It will become final after being
published in the Federal Register, maybe as early
as this fall.

The threat of the tailings leaching into the
Colorado River was heightened by January flooding
in southern Utah.

"It was very much a real issue, and I'm very glad
this chapter will be behind us," said Utah Gov.
Jon Huntsman. "We've had a convergence of lot of
positive things here."

Plans are in place to begin moving the tailings to
Crescent Junction in the spring of 2007, and
Huntsman has given his initial support for that
location. Other state officials were not available
Monday, which was a state holiday in Utah.

The 94-foot-tall waste pile came from Moab's rich
uranium deposits, which were mined in the 1950s
for nuclear bombs. The Uranium Reduction Co. sold
its mill in 1962 to Atlas Corp., which ran it
sporadically until declaring bankruptcy in 1998.
The Energy Department took over the site in 2001.

"Taking all the facts into account, we believe the
recommendations issued today provide the best
solution to cleaning up Moab and protecting the
river," Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said in a
prepared statement. "The Colorado River is the
lifeblood of the Southwest."

The Energy Department "made the right decision to
move this pile to a safe location," said U.S. Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

The tailings are now mostly stored in the open air
on bare ground, surrounded only by a chain-link
fence.

At the storage facility in Crescent Junction, the
waste would be covered and buried in a hole, lined
with a protective layer to keep the material from
seeping into the groundwater. Cleanup and moving
the pile has been estimated to cost more than $300
million.

The waste began piling up in the 1950s after the
Atomic Age turned sleepy communities in Utah into
uranium mining boom towns. The department took
control of the site in 2001 after the most recent
owner of the mill, Denver-based Atlas Corp.,
declared bankruptcy in 1998.

In November, the Energy Department outlined four
options for the site. Three of them called for
moving the waste and burying it anywhere from 17
to 85 miles away in a hole. Option No. 4, which
would have cost only half as much, called for
leaving the pile in place but covering it over
with dirt and rocks.

Critics of moving the waste argued that it has
been there for decades with little effect. They
contended the area is rich in uranium, leading to
natural erosion and leaching of radioactive
materials into the water, to which the waste added
little.

But Huntsman, Utah's congressional delegation,
scores of activists and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency said that waste is too dangerous
to leave it so close to the Colorado River.

Senate wants regions to have say on nuclear waste 
repositories

Prague Daily Monitor
(PDM staff with CTK) 1 August 2005- On Friday, the
Senate supported a proposal that would give Czech
municipalities and regions a say in decisions on
nuclear waste repositories on their territories.

The upper house also proposes financially
compensating municipalities which have a
repository on their territory.

The amendment will be submitted to the Chamber of
Deputies and the government for discussion.

Senator Jitka Seitlova said that the proposal is a
compromise. She had wanted the municipalities to
be able to veto a decision on a repository. She
added that the amendment had been discussed nearly
two years.

A search for a new repository location had to be
stopped over massive protests and conflicts
between the state and the regions concerned.

"The construction of a repository for used fuel
from nuclear reactors will forever change the life
of the municipalities in question. Environmental
organisations feel that local people should have
the right to take part in the decision
effectively," said Edvard Sequens of the
environmental NGO Calla .

Libor Matousek of Friends of the Earth said the
state cannot be in a never-ending war with regions
and municipalities because of its attitude based
on pressure.

Greenpeace supported municipalities against the
state in this issue as well.

The Senate proposed that the municipalities would
receive CZK 0.2 per square metre of repository
annually.

According to available information, the Czech
Republic produces several tonnes of highly
radioactive nuclear waste and about 50 tonnes of
spent fuel from the Dukovany nuclear power plant,
which is temporarily stored on the plant's
premises.

The state planst to construct a repository. Six
locations have been selected, but locals in all
the cases have protested the construction, which
is to start in 2050.

	 Energy bill OKs plan to clean up UA reactor site

BY CHRIS BRANAM

Posted on Saturday, July 30, 2005

U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln, DArk., has spent the
past six years hoping to persuade the federal
government to clean up the remains of an abandoned
nuclear reactor owned by the University of
Arkansas at Fayetteville.

LincolnÕs pursuit took a significant step Friday,
when the Senate passed a $14.5 billion energy bill
that includes a provision authorizing the federal
Department of Energy to spend $16 million to
decommission and decontaminate the Southwest
Experimental Fast Oxide Reactor.

The defunct test-site reactor, known as SEFOR, is
near Strickler, about 20 miles southwest of
Fayetteville in Washington County.

The SEFOR Cleanup Act of 2005, sponsored by
Lincoln, doesnÕt include an appropriation for the
project, however.

Lincoln hopes to get such funding in the federal
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 2006, she said in
a phone interview from her Capitol Hill office.
"It has taken us a long time to get over this
hurdle," Lincoln said. "WeÕre going to be fighting
just as hard for the appropriation as we did for
the authorization. I want to get this sucker
done."

Lincoln got the decommissioning of SEFOR into
energy bills in 2003 and last year, but both bills
died. In 2000, Lincoln got a cleanup proposal
included in a nuclear waste bill, but President
Clinton vetoed it.

Lincoln has maintained that the federal government
helped build the reactor and should bear the cost
of cleaning it up.

The nuclear facility was built between 1965 and
1968 by Southwest Atomic Energy Associates, a
consortium of 17 utility companies, General
Electric Co., the West German government, the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission and the European Atomic
Energy Community.

It opened in 1969 and was permanently shut down in
1972. Its nuclear core was removed but some
radioactive material was left behind.

UA acquired the reactor and the surrounding 620
acres in 1972 with hopes of using the facility to
train future nuclear engineers.

That was before the collapse of the domestic
nuclear energy industry later in the 1970s. UA
never used the reactor for research purposes and
was saddled with a useless lab.

UA spends about $50,000 a year for maintenance and
safety precautions at SEFOR, said Collis Geren,
the universityÕs vice provost for research.

Geren is optimistic that federal money will flow
for the reactorÕs removal, he said. "[The
authorization] was the big hurdle, to get it in
the bill that says this is a worthwhile project
that should be supported federally," he said.

Decommissioning SEFOR will probably take five
years after an appropriation is made, Geren said.

The site is contaminated with residual radiation,
liquid sodium, lead, asbestos and PCBs
(polychlorinated biphenyls), which are toxic,
according to the Energy Department.

In 1998, the Energy Department spent $250,000 to
study how much it would cost to clean up the site.

The department came up with a $16 million
estimate, which included $2 million to devise a
plan to remove PCBs from the one remaining
transformer on the property and $8 million for the
removal of asbestos and sodium metal residue.

Remaining costs would include physically removing
the structure and material containing residual
radioactivity. FEEDBACK:

Nuclear industry demands new laws to ban protest break-ins

 http://www.sundayherald.com/
By Rob Edwards, Environment Editor

 
 A LOOPHOLE in the law which makes it perfectly
 legal to invade a nuclear power station must be
 closed, the government has been told by its chief
 adviser on nuclear security.

 In a report to ministers, the UKÕs director of
 civil nuclear security, Roger Brunt, has demanded
 new legislation to outlaw unauthorised entry to
 nuclear sites. It is a deficiency of serious
 concern which requires urgent action, he said.

 His call is enthusiastically backed by British
 Energy, the company that operates nuclear power
 stations. But it is rejected by anti-nuclear
 campaigners as a ploy to suppress peaceful
 protest.

 BruntÕs annual report on the state of civil
 nuclear security in the UK was slipped quietly on
 to a government website last week. In it, he
 pointed out that Òhigh-profile incursions into
 public buildingsÓ were an attractive tactic for
 protesters.

 ÒThe lack of a legal deterrent to dissuade such
 action is a most significant concern to me and
 addressing it is my highest legislative
 priority,Ó he said. He requested Òearly actionÓ
 from ministers to change the law.

 But BruntÕs request was dismissed as
 ÒpreposterousÓ by Pete Roche, a consultant to
 Greenpeace. ÒHe is using current concern about
 terrorism to hide the fact that he is simply
 stifling peaceful protest,Ó Roche claimed.

 ÒIf terrorists targeted a nuclear power station
 with its stores of dangerous radioactive
 material, they could spread fallout for miles
 around. In the short term, the only answer is to
 improve physical security, but ultimately we have
 to stop producing nuclear waste.Ó

 Roche argued that there were already enough laws,
 including breach of the peace and criminal
 damage, to deter people from entering a nuclear
 site. The last time Greenpeace had tried it had
 been Òrelatively easyÓ to gain access, he said.

 In recent years, Greenpeace has organised two
 major invasions of a nuclear power station at
 Sizewell in Suffolk. In October 2002, more than
 100 protesters Ð including several in Homer
 Simpson costumes Ð occupied the site for more
 than 12 hours.

 In January the following year, demonstrators
 climbed on to the reactor dome after cutting a
 hole in the perimeter fence. ÒSizewell is easier
 to get into than a Norwich night club,Ó one of
 them commented.

 BruntÕs predecessor, Michael Buckland-Smith, last
 year accused Greenpeace of diverting resources
 from counter-terrorism work. ÒIncursions by
 demonstrators into nuclear sites are
 irresponsible and unjustified, especially when
 the threat of terrorist attack is as high as it
 is at present,Ó he said.

 British Energy strongly supported making it
 illegal to gain unauthorised access to its eight
 nuclear power stations, including Hunterston and
 Torness in Scotland. ÒThe law should allow for
 licensed nuclear sites to be brought in line with
 other sensitive sites such as docks, airports,
 railways and tunnels,Ó said a company
 spokeswoman.

 Ministers are now considering how to respond to
 BruntÕs request.

 Brunt is head of the Office for Civil Nuclear
 Security, a secretive outstation of the
 Department of Trade and Industry at Harwell in
 Oxfordshire. As well as highlighting the legal
 loophole, his report reveals a huge backlog in
 vetting security staff for nuclear stations.

 Staff shortages caused partly by Òa major DTI
 downsizing exerciseÓ meant that there were nearly
 3000 people awaiting security clearance at the
 end of March. This has caused delays in
 confirming jobs and extra costs, Brunt said.

 Dr David Lowry, a nuclear security consultant,
 pointed out that government plans to deal with
 nuclear waste would require thousands more
 workers to be vetted. ÒThere seem to be no plans
 to ensure these workers can be vetted in time,Ó
 he said.

 ÒThere is a real danger that pressure to deal
 with the waste will lead to corners being cut in
 applying proper vetting procedures. At a time
 when terrorist threats have never been higher, it
 would be irresponsible to let unvetted or
 partially vetted contractors move and manage
 radioactive waste.Ó

 BruntÕs report says there were 37 nuclear
 security incidents reported between April 2004
 and March 2004. Most of these were disclosed
 previously in response to a request under the
 Freedom of Information Act.

 They included people climbing perimeter fences to
 take shortcuts, using forged or borrowed passes
 and sending restricted information over the
 internet. On one occasion, two visitors made Òa
 genuine error and gained unauthorised and
 unescorted access to a siteÓ.

 The most serious incidents were thefts of
 sensitive material, including two laptops stolen
 from private cars in March 2005. ÒThe compromise
 of information in each case was not significant
 but the fact that the thefts had occurred points
 to a growing trend,Ó said Brunt. ÒInspectors and
 security managers in the industry are devoting
 great efforts to reverse this trend and improve
 this disappointing lack of security awareness.Ó

Uranium explorers stake out Canada
	 
	 

Saturday, July 30, 2005 12:09:24 PM ET

By Nicole Mordant

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Canada's
hot and humid summer is often a quiet time in the
mining industry but some exciting uranium finds
this year have kept prospectors and investors from
lounging at the lake.

There's been a 44 percent surge in the uranium
price this year, and Canada's exploration industry
has fanned out across almost every province and
territory in search of new deposits of the heavy
metal, which is fairly abundant in the Earth's
crust.

Uranium is popular again as the world hunts for
new and cheaper sources of energy to generate
electricity and as coal-fired power plants get a
bad rap from those worried about carbon dioxide
emissions and global warming.

From British Columbia in the west to Nunavut in
the north and Labrador in the east, some 60 junior
mining firms are hunting for the next big lode of
uranium, which is mostly used to produce
electricity in nuclear power stations.

"The recent news of a new discovery in the
Athabasca Basin by partners UEX Corp. and Cogema
appears to have the market buzzing again about
junior uranium explorers," said National Bank
Financial analyst Brian Christie.

The Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan is
already the world's biggest uranium-producing
region, where world No. 1 miner Cameco Corp. each
year unearths millions of pounds of the dense,
silvery-white metal.

UEX and Cogema's discovery comes at a time when
spot uranium prices, most recently at $29.50 a
pound, are at their highest levels since the 1970s
because of industry estimates of a 35 to 45
million pound shortage of mined material a year.

Although the deficit is still being met out of
above-ground stockpiles, for many years a
millstone on prices, these could run out in a few
years. There are 440 nuclear reactors worldwide
needing uranium and energy-hungry China alone is
planning to build another 30 over the next 15
years.

Christie's research shows that the number of
active uranium-seeking junior miners listed on
Toronto's two stock exchanges has more than
tripled to 60 in only four months.

With just about every inch of land in the
Athabasca staked, new explorers such as Firestone
Ventures Inc. have headed to less
geologically-tested areas like southern Alberta.

"The appeal to a junior explorer like us is to go
out and find an area. What we like about southern
Alberta is that it could be a whole new district.
The uranium potential is unknown," said Lori
Walton, Firestone's president.

"Alberta has a history of being an energy rich
province with oil, gas and coal. I think we would
have a really good reception to being a uranium
producer too," she told Reuters.

Less certain about their reception are explorers
in neighboring British Columbia, which imposed a
moratorium on uranium exploration and mining
between 1980 and 1987 after a commission concluded
that the health risks for the people who extract
the radioactive metal were too great.

At least three junior companies, Aldershot
Resources Ltd., Sparton Resources and Santoy
Resources Ltd. are busy trying to acquire uranium
claims in the Okanagan area in south-central
British Columbia.

According to Geoff Freer, BC's assistant deputy
minister of mining and minerals, there is nothing
today to stop companies from applying to the West
Coast province's government for a uranium
exploration permit. But no one has yet.

He added though that nuclear energy "is not in
BC's future." And any suggestion of a uranium
industry in the environmentally conscious province
has already angered some green movement activists.

They point to its use in making nuclear bombs, the
problem of where to store radioactive waste and to
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in
1986 that killed 30 people and forced 200,000 to
flee a cloud of radioactive debris as it drifted
over the then Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

BC's Green Party, which has some clout in the
politics of the province, has called for the
moratorium to be reimposed.

Asked if the potential opposition even before the
company had started to explore made it worth the
bother, Santoy Resources spokesman Rupert Allan
had few doubts. "The potential economics are very
attractive. I think it's worth the effort," he
said.

Pentagon drags feet on base cleanup

By: Gail Chatfield - Commentary

For more than 50 years Camp Pendleton has buffered
San Diego and Orange counties from becoming one
continuous, overbuilt coastline. The 17-mile
stretch of ocean to mountain scenery is
appreciated, but, more important, Pendleton must
remain a working base.

With its 125,000 or so acres, I never realized
that Camp Pendleton might feel the urban
encroachment assaults from its neighbors.
Urbanization around military bases across the
nation has presented the military with new
challenges on how to maintain combat readiness.

Air-space restrictions, noise regulations, air
quality rules and concerns for endangered species
are claimed to be responsible for limiting
training on bases. As housing developments edge
closer to Pendleton, the habitat for endangered
and protected species is depleted and the critters
move toward the natural terrain on the base.

Forming a novel arrangement with conservation
groups The Nature Conservancy and the Trust for
Public Land, Pendleton hopes to create a
conservation buffer zone outside the base.

By purchase or transfer of property development
rights, Pendleton would acquire the undeveloped
land on its northeast boundary near Fallbrook and
conservationists would be able to preserve the
natural terrain as a migration route and habitat
for indigenous wildlife.

That's good news for animal species, but what
about human species living or working on our
nation's military bases?

By the nature of their business, military bases
are toxic waste sites. The extent of the damage is
not known until the base is closed and the
installation is decontaminated before being
converted to another use.

Since 1988, there have been 34 military facilities
closed, yet not one has been completely cleaned
up. They have been decontaminating Fort Ord for 14
years.

Costs to clean up the sites could trump any cost
savings of base closures. So far, the Pentagon has
spent $8.3 billion and anticipates spending $3.6
billion more. The Department of Defense has even
suggested delaying Superfund cleanup until the
contamination has spread "outside the fence" of
military installations.

Difficult-to-remove contaminants like
cancer-causing trichloroethylene, asbestos-tainted
soil, perchlorate in jet fuel, lead paint,
radioactive materials and a contaminated water
table remain after the military leaves. These same
pollutants were present when the base was open.

The military must be able to perform its duties,
but one would hope the Pentagon would have the
strictest possible EPA standards to protect the
military personnel who live and work around these
contaminants on a daily basis. An investigation by
USA Today found that since 2001, EPA inspections
of military bases have dropped 26 percent; fines
and enforcement actions against the military are
down 25 percent; and the Pentagon budget for
pollution cleanup is down 20 percent. This may be
due to the exemptions and immunity from
environmental regulations granted to the military.

Marines shouldn't need to restrict training
because of a Pacific pocket mouse, but our
military's health is a part of the environment we
also need to protect.

Idaho Could Be Headed for Another N-Wastes Battle

BOISE -- A decade after cutting an unprecedented
deal forcing the federal government to ship tons
of highly radioactive refuse out-of- state for
disposal, Idaho may be entering a new round of
nuclear waste wars with the U.S. Department of
Energy.

State officials say they are concerned the Energy
Department has been making conflicting statements
whether it will transport waste produced by a
proposed plutonium-238 production plant at the
Idaho National Laboratory complex to New Mexico
for permanent burial in an underground repository.

The scientist who oversees the department's Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico initially told
the Associated Press that the plant wouldn't take
the Idaho material because it would be a a
byproduct of civilian projects for NASA and
national security agencies, and therefore wouldn't
qualify as waste from "atomic energy defense
activities."

Only defense program waste is eligible for burial
in the deep geologic salt beds near Carlsbad that
Congress set aside in 1979.

But after conferring with department officials in
Idaho, who have maintained in public hearings
around the state this month that the 20 cubic
meters of "transuranic" waste created each year --
plutonium-contaminated gloves, tools, rags and
other rubbish that would fill 96 55-gallon drums
-- will go to New Mexico for burial, the dump's
chief scientist Roger Nelson said the Idaho waste
would indeed be eligible for burial at the
out-of-state defense waste dump.

"Because the proposal calls for the use of
plutonium-238 in national security applications,
we believe any potential transuranic waste would
be eligible for disposal at WIPP," he said.

A 1996 opinion by the department's then-general
counsel Robert Nordhaus outlines which defense
nuclear projects are eligible to deposit waste at
the New Mexico dump.

"A strict interpretation of the Nordhaus memo does
not allow NASA applications to qualify," Nelson
said in an earlier interview. Later, he and other
department officials declined to specify how they
subsequently concluded plutonium projects for NASA
and national security agencies would actually be
considered defense activities under the 1996
guidelines.

"It would be premature to comment on any specifics
because no decision has been made on the project
at this point," said Tim Jackson, a spokesman for
the Energy Department.

Kathleen Trever, nuclear waste policy adviser to
Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, said the state is
refraining from endorsing the $300 million
plutonium project.

"An important lesson we've learned is to make sure
the disposal site says we can accept the waste,"
Trever said. "We won't be in full support of the
project until it's demonstrated that a clear
disposal path has been arranged for all the
waste."

Idaho has a high-profile history of squaring off
against the federal government over nuclear waste
storage at the 890-square- mile complex, which
sits above the Snake River Plain aquifer. The
aquifer is one of the largest in the world,
containing about as much water as Lake Erie, and
is the major source of irrigation and drinking
water for more than 10,000 square miles of the
southeastern corner of the state.

In 1988, Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus unilaterally
forbade additional shipments of radioactive waste
left over from nuclear weapons production in
Colorado from entering Idaho. In 1995, Republican
Gov. Phil Batt forced the Energy Department to
agree to remove all radioactive waste from the
site by 2036 under a series of strict timelines
and to limit the amount of new waste brought into
the state.

While the Batt agreement has forced the department
to ship tons of defense-related plutonium waste
out of Idaho to the New Mexico repository, the
federal government is struggling to meet the
deal's quota requirement of 6,000 cubic meters
removed from 2002 through 2005. At the end of last
month, the department had only exported 1,235
cubic meters over the first two and a half years
of the three- year period and appears unlikely to
ship all of the remaining 4,765 cubic meters by
Dec. 31.

The Bush administration wants to consolidate in
Idaho all the production of plutonium-powered
"space batteries" that will be used for NASA space
missions and unspecified national security
applications. The batteries won't be used in any
weapons, military satellites or missile defense
systems, according to a draft environmental impact
statement released last month. The current
stockpile of plutonium-238 is running low, and the
Energy Department wants to begin producing 11
pounds of the highly radioactive material per year
for 35 years beginning in 2011.

The department's position that plutonium waste
from the Idaho project would qualify for burial at
the New Mexico dump could trigger a legal battle
or a renegotiation of the terms of the federal
land withdrawal deal between the agency and the
state of New Mexico, said Anne deLain Clark,
coordinator of New Mexico's task force on
radioactive waste.

"This does not sound like defense waste and from
New Mexico's point of view, anything not already
established in the current inventory increases
amount of waste that comes into the state so we
would definitely have concerns," Clark said.

Because plutonium-238 is made from another fissile
material, neptunium-237, department officials may
argue that the "pedigree" of the Idaho plutonium
is rooted in a defense application because that
material was originally created for defense use at
DOE's Savannah River complex in South Carolina.

But Nelson, chief scientist at the New Mexico
repository, said the 1996 Nordhaus memo doesn't
address such situations.

"If the material was born with a defense pedigree,
then no matter what you do to it in the future is
it still defense-related?" said Nelson. "We
haven't been asked yet and if we are, that's going
to take a lot of legal scrutiny to determine."

Company seeks new permit to draw uranium from aquifer

08/01/2005

By LYNN BREZOSKY  / Associated Press

Uranium mining in Kleberg County has not posed a
health risk and should be allowed to continue, a
lawyer for Lewisville-based Uranium Resources Inc.
said Monday.

"The ground water in the mine zone, as you will
hear later on, is radioactive today, was
radioactive when Columbus came through," URI
attorney Jep Hill said. "The materials are there
... and URI is doing its best to remove
materials."

With uranium prices on a rebound, URI is seeking
to renew a permit to draw uranium from an aquifer
below Texas's Coastal Bend. At residents' request,
a state administrative law judge will hear
arguments that URI has failed to clean up
abandoned mining sites and must not be allowed to
endanger their water.

"There is no certainty that human life will be
protected," said Enrique Valdivia, a legal aid
attorney representing a family who last year
learned the wells from which they've drawn
drinking water for five generations was
undrinkable because of uranium contamination.

The Garcia family believes the mining caused
uranium to seep into their well, and county
residents who fought the mining for decades say
the uranium may eventually drift toward the
underground water serving Kingsville.

Kingsville, population 26,000, is home to a naval
base and a growing university campus.

The hearings before Judge Paul Keeper are expected
to last two weeks. Keeper will then make a
recommendation to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality in the fall.

After suspending mining in the 1990s because of
plummeting prices on uranium, URI now wants to
restart in an area Hill said had been approved in
1989 and had not changed.

URI also wants to renew permits for two injection
wells, which are used to pump wastewater into deep
underground crevices.

Hill brought boxes of paperwork to the hearing
that he said documented that any hazardous
material from URI mining was contained while
within the earth.

"Annual monitoring has demonstrated repeatedly
that it is performing exactly as expected."

He said the URI mining has nothing to do with the
Garcia well.

The URI mines use a process known as in-situ
mining, by which injection wells introduce mining
solutions that mobilize uranium and other metals
(including arsenic) so it can be pumped to the
surface.

Chemicals draw the uranium from the water.

A reverse osmosis system removes salts and other
minerals used to isolate the uranium before the
water is pumped back into the aquifer.

Melanie Oberlin, an attorney for the citizens'
group South Texas Opposes Pollution, said
residents believe URI broke promises made in the
1980s that it would clean the wells within two
years of completing mining.

Claiming financial problems from falling uranium
prices, URI in the late 1990s said it was unable
to complete water restoration. The state allowed
URI to use some of its bond money to guarantee
cleanup to begin restoration, and URI says
restoration is proceeding.

In December, URI reached an agreement with Kleberg
County allowing the company to resume mining as
long as it continues cleanup.

County Judge Pete De La Garza said it was the best
way to assure that the roughly $5 million in
cleanup would be done.

Residents want uranium mines stopped
URI responsible for problems in Kleberg, they say

By LYNN BREZOSKY Associated Press
August 1, 2005

RICARDO - The extended Garcia family has lived for
five generations in a cluster of frame and trailer
homes known, with some irony, as Garcia Hill
because its compound sits maybe a foot higher than
the surrounding scrub.

The Garcias have another local distinction: Their
water is contaminated with uranium at levels so
high the U.S. Environmental Protection
Administration has told them to stop drinking it
and see their doctors because of a high risk of
cancer.

The government and the company that has been
mining uranium in the area for the past 20 years
told the Garcias the contamination is natural
seepage from the vein of the radioactive material
that runs near their well, the very uranium that
attracted Lewisville-based Uranium Resources Inc.
to Kleberg County in the first place.

The Garcias and other Kleberg County residents
don't accept that explanation.

"That's weird that it's the only place and nobody
else has it," Humberto Garcia said. "It just kind
of raises questions. A quarter-mile away we have
relatives, and their well is OK."

The Garcias and other local residents see the
family's plight as an emblem of the problems they
say URI has dumped on them for decades.

URI well casings stick out of the ground on Garcia
Hill. In the 1980s and early 1990s, URI pumps
sucked uraniumfilled water from deep underground
for processing.

The activity ended when prices plummeted from more
than $30 a pound to around $7. Claiming financial
problems, the company left without cleaning up the
area or restoring the water below.

"The promise was they would take all the uranium
and leave the water clean," said Teo Saenz,
president of South Texas Opposes Pollution. "They
didn't."

STOP members, who number about a dozen, say an
engineer mapped the underground for them in the
mid-1990s and accurately predicted that
contamination from the mine field would migrate
first to the Garcia wells. They now fear poisoned
water will seep toward the water supply of nearby
Kingsville, population 26,000.

The county reached a settlement in December with
URI to clean the water. Under the agreement, the
company must clean up its first old mine before
starting mining on the third, the second mine
before completing the third, then the third mine
before starting on the fourth, County Judge Pete
De La Garza said. The company also must pay the
county $20,000 for an expert to monitor their
cleanup.

At a public hearing today, Garcia and other local
residents will argue that because the company
failed to clean up its former operations, it
shouldn't be allowed to mine new areas. The
administrative judge will make a recommendation to
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

STOP members hold little hope that they'll stop
what will be URI's third and fourth mines. They
said Kleberg County officials let them down by
signing the settlement agreement.

"The settlement basically says they will make a
'good faith effort' to clean up the water," Walsh
said. "It was a very big blow to us."

De La Garza said the agreement was the county's
best route toward getting at least $5 million
worth of cleanup done.

"We had two choices, the way I see it," he said.
"The first choice was just to not allow them to
mine, let them go away and leave our water dirty.
The second I thought was more prudent - to get our
water cleaned up. We're talking about millions of
dollars."

Mark Pelizza, a URI vice president, said URI has
operated prudently and that the residents can't
see what cleanup they already have done. He said
their operations have nothing to do with the
Garcia Hill poisoning.

"I think the evidence is the uranium deposit
underlies their houses, and it is established that
it is natural," Pelizza said.

Pelizza explained that a reverse osmosis system

He said removing the well casings was the last
step of the cleanup and could not be done until
the state approved.

He said STOP's concerns about their operations
affecting water in Kingsville are unfounded.

"That issue was reviewed thoroughly in the past
and it's been determined that is not a problem,"
he said.

But Kleberg County residents who leased land to
URI say they wished their families hadn't bought
into URI's promises 25 years ago of easy
royalties, regional prosperity, and
better-than-before cleanup.

"It's been how many years now that we cannot farm
the land?" said Elizabeth Cumberland, whose family
leased land to URI in 1980. "I personally believe
we have simply lost that land."

Cumberland's ancestors came on the first train to
bring new settlers to the area in 1904, not long
after ranch scion Robert Kleberg's well digger
found water 700 feet down.

In protest of URI "tearing things up," the Garcias
haven't cashed their annual URI lease check,
usually around $1,100, in several years.

"We just started sending the checks back," Garcia
said. "All these things kind of bother you a
little bit. People trying to make a lot of money."

They were shocked to get a letter from the EPA in
October 2004 informing them they should stop
drinking their water and see their doctors. The
letter told them they had an elevated risk for
cancer.

Tom Poeton, an EPA environmental engineer, said
the EPA isn't responsible for testing private
water sources and sent the letter as a courtesy.

The ecological effects of the Chernobyl disaster
I-Newswire.com (press release) - 21 hours ago

Nearly 20 years ago Reactor number 4 at Chernobyl
exploded, sending radiation across a large region
of what is now the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
Some 40 radionucleotides were released into the
environment, including Strontium 90 (90Sr) and
Cesium 137 (137Cs). Yet despite radiation levels
dangerous to humans, most natural areas in the
region have rebounded, and by ecological
standards, are functioning normally. The session,
organized by James Morris and Timothy Mousseau
(University of South Carolina, US) will reveal how
the environment has responded -- from genetic
mutation rates, to plant and animal communities,
to nutrient cycling.



(I-Newswire) - Sergey Gaschak ( International
Radioecology Laboratory, Ukraine ) will open the
session with his presentation, "Determinants of
levels of 90Sr and 137Cs in birds in Chernobyl."
Studying 228 birds of 23 different species
captured in Chernobyl, Gaschak and colleagues from
the University of South Carolina ( US ) and
University Pierre et Marie Curie ( France )
measured the birds' levels of radioactive
strontium and radioactive cesium, comparing
migrating populations with those that remain in
the area, as well as examining age, sex, and
nesting preferences to determine the amounts and
types of radiation accumulating in the birds. In
the presentation, Gaschak will discuss how
quantities of 90Sr and 137Cs vary with feeding,
nesting and migration habits.

Timothy Mousseau will present "Consequences of
radiation for reproduction and survival of barn
swallows Hirundo rustica from Chernobyl." Barn
swallows are long-distance migratory birds, which
nest across Europe, providing researchers with
numerous populations to sample. Examining swallows
from the Chernobyl region and Kanev, southeast of
Kiev, Mousseau and his colleague, Anders Moller (
Laboratorie de Parasitologie Evolutive, France ),
found reproductive success was significantly
reduced for the Chernobyl-nesting birds. Survival
rates, number of eggs laid, and overall body
condition was lower, despite similar nesting and
laying dates.

The radio nucleotides in the area also filter into
the soil, and from there into plants. Animals that
consume these plants, including livestock, then
take up the radionucleotides. Viktor Dolin (
National Academy of Sciences, Kyiv, Ukraine ) will
discuss a newly described process of environmental
self-cleaning in the talk, "Biogeochemical cycling
of radionucleotide: Implications for the human
food web." Dolin calculated the rate of 137Cs and
90Srs moving through the environment, then used
the data to determine an ecosystem's ability to
"clean" itself of excess radiation.

Oleksander Orlov's ( Ukrainian Scientific Research
Institute ) presentation, "The distribution and
cycling of 137Cs in forests of the Chernobyl
exclusion zone," will focus on 137Cs levels in
three 50-year old Scotch Pine forests. Forest
litter, moss, lichens, understory, macromycetes,
and canopy 137Cs activity measurements will be
described. Also working in these pine forests,
Vadim Skripkin and colleagues from the Institute
for Environmental Geochemistry, Ukraine and the
University of South Carolina will report their
findings on the distribution of 14C in, "The
turnover of 14C carbon in forests of the Chernobyl
exclusion zone."

The final presentation of the session, Ronald
Chesser ( Texas Tech University, US ) will
describe the distribution and effects of radiation
doses that hit wildlife that were living in the
area at the time of the accident, as well as how
the populations recovered in the talk, "Temporal
trends in radiation doses, survival, and recovery
in wildlife populations at Chernobyl."

Organized Oral Session 7: "Ecological effects of
the Chernobyl disaster: Genes to ecosystems," will
take place Monday 8 August 2005, 1:30 - 5:00 PM in
Meeting Room 510 A, Level 5, Palais des congrs de
Montral.

American Ecology Opens New Texas 
Waste Treatment Building

Design Offers Increased Waste Throughput, 
Improved Environmental Protection

BOISE, ID (08/08/05 -- American Ecology
Corporation (Nasdaq:ECOL) today announced that
subsidiary US Ecology Texas has resumed full
treatment services in a new hazardous waste
treatment building constructed at its Robstown,
Texas hazardous waste treatment and disposal
facility.

"Our Texas facility's new treatment building is
designed to deliver increased throughput for the
full range of wastes included in our operating
permit," stated American Ecology President and
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Romano. "The
building's advanced design also offers our
customers a safe, environmentally superior
solution to their hazardous waste service needs,"
Romano added.

The 6,000 square foot building's environmental
controls include a high-volume air emission
control system with baghouse, double-walled steel
treatment tanks, tank misting system, and an
automated treatment reagent measurement and
delivery system. These systems will allow the
Texas site to expand dusty waste treatment
services, and increase options for solidification
and disposal of liquids and sludges.

"The opening of a more efficient, high throughput
waste treatment building is an important element
of our growth strategy for the Texas operation,"
Romano concluded.

Hazardous waste treatment services were suspended
at the Texas facility following a July 1, 2004
fire. Limited treatment resumed in December 2004
following repairs to the fire-damaged building.
The repaired building remains in use for a limited
range of services. Resumption of full treatment
services became possible with the opening of the
new building.

American Ecology Corporation, through its
subsidiaries, provides radioactive, PCB, hazardous
and non-hazardous waste services to commercial and
government customers throughout the United States,
such as nuclear power plants, steel mills, medical
and academic institutions, refineries and chemical

 The senator's gift to terrorists
By Alan J. Kuperman The New York Times

FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 2005

AUSTIN, Texas 

An obscure provision of the U.S. energy bill
signed into law this week by President George W.
Bush demonstrates how, even in this era of
heightened concern about terrorism, narrow
commercial considerations can trump America's
security at the behest of one senator.

Despite widespread opposition - from the Bush
administration, a majority of the Senate, leaders
of the House Energy Committee, and nuclear
regulators from the five preceding presidential
administrations - Senator Pete Domenici,
Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the
Energy Committee, included an amendment that guts
restrictions on the export of highly enriched
uranium, the same material used in the Hiroshima
atomic bomb.

If terrorists obtained enough such uranium they
could fashion a full-fledged nuclear weapon, not
merely a "dirty bomb" that would scatter
radioactive waste. As the late Manhattan Project
physicist Luis Alvarez noted in his memoirs: "With
modern weapons-grade uranium, the background
neutron rate is so low that terrorists, if they
had such material, would have a good chance of
setting off a high-yield explosion simply by
dropping one half of the material onto the other
half. ... Even a high school kid could make a bomb
in short order."

The new law increases the likelihood of that
nightmare scenario by allowing exports of
bomb-grade uranium to foreign companies to rise to
more than 100 pounds, or 45 kilograms, annually,
thereby multiplying the odds that terrorists could
steal enough for a bomb while the uranium is in
transit to, or in storage at, foreign facilities.

Why would Domenici favor increasing exports of
bomb-grade uranium that could lead to the perfect
terrorist weapon? One reason may be that lobbyists
claimed that foreign pharmaceutical companies need
this type of uranium to produce medical isotopes
that are re-imported to diagnose and treat
thousands of American patients in the absence of a
domestic producer. But in reality, these vital
isotopes can be produced just as well with
low-enriched uranium, which is not bomb-grade, as
facilities in Argentina and Australia already do.

The actual driving factor is money. Companies that
produce isotopes in Belgium, Canada and the
Netherlands for export to the United States want
to avoid the expense and inconvenience of
converting their production processes to use the
safer uranium. But American law had barred export
of bomb-grade uranium to them, except on an
interim basis if they were in the process of
converting to the safer alternative. Rather than
responsibly complying with this antiterrorism
statute, the foreign producers cynically tried to
eliminate it - and succeeded, thanks to Domenici's
intervention.

Although Bush signed the energy bill under the
pressure of spiraling gas prices, his Energy
Department strongly opposed lifting the export
restrictions. Its top official for nuclear
nonproliferation, Paul Longsworth, warned last
month that the provision "may undermine support of
the U.S. highly enriched uranium minimization
policy and nuclear export control system."

The legislation also prompted a bipartisan group
of scientists, policy specialists (including
myself) and former officials responsible for
various aspects of nuclear security under every
president since Gerald Ford to send a letter to
Domenici pleading with him not "to weaken a major
provision of the U.S. nonproliferation law that
makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain
material capable of producing a nuclear bomb."

The ill-advised amendment actually failed the only
vote ever held specifically on it by either house
of Congress, in the Senate on June 23, 2005, by 52
to 46. The House of Representatives had slipped
the provision into the energy bill without a vote,
but once its ramifications became clear, both the
House Energy Committee's chairman, Joe Barton, a
Republican from Texas, and its ranking Democrat,
John Dingell from Michigan, came to oppose it.
They offered Domenici a compromise to neuter the
provision in deference to the Senate's vote
against it.

This is where Domenici abused his power as Senate
committee chair. He successfully pushed all of the
Republicans he appointed to the House-Senate
conference on the bill to vote for his provision -
against the expressed will of the Senate. He then
rejected the House's offer to eliminate the
provision, thereby strong-arming the provision
into law over the bipartisan opposition of
executive and legislative branch officials.
Congress and the White House should rectify this
grievous error - before it is too late.

Error at Los Alamos spreads nuclear material
By KEAY DAVIDSON
San Francisco Chronicle

 

August 10, 2005
Wednesday


The apparent mishandling of a potentially
hazardous radioactive substance by an employee of
the University of California-run Los Alamos
National Laboratory has resulted in contamination
of sites in four states, according to a report
released Monday.

Traces of the substance have been found in homes
in Colorado and Kansas that the Los Alamos
employee visited, his own home in New Mexico, and
also at the Pennsylvania laboratory where the
employee apparently shipped a contaminated package
via FedEx.

Los Alamos doctors are monitoring the health of
the employee and five lab colleagues who might
have been contaminated by the substance,
radioactive americium-241. So far, none show ill
effects, lab officials said Monday.

Los Alamos investigators uncovered the incident
and reported it in a July 27 press release, but a
more extensive internal report by lab officials,
obtained by the Project on Government Oversight
(POGO), a Washington-based watchdog group, was
released Monday.

"The package could have contaminated Federal
Express workers and other packages," Beth Daley, a
POGO spokeswoman, told The Chronicle.
"Surprisingly, it took Los Alamos two full days
after it discovered the initial contamination
incident to notify (the Pennsylvania laboratory)
that it was in possession of an unmarked
radioactive package."

It shows "there's a complete lack of
accountability when it comes to health and
environmental protection at the lab," Daley added.
"It's a sign that the DOE needs to rein UC in. One
way to do that is to start fining the university
when it violates its regulations and laws."

Los Alamos spokeswoman Kathy DeLucas said the
lab's investigation of the incident is still under
way. She declined to identify any of the people
who are being monitored medically, to protect
their privacy.

There is disagreement over the potential health
risks of the contamination. July 27, lab officials
said the amount of radioactivity that traveled
away from Los Alamos "is a fraction of the
radioactivity contained in a typical residential
smoke detector . . . (The) extremely low levels of
radioactive material found at the employee's home
do not pose a credible risk to the general
public."

But POGO officials said they were disturbed by
news of the contamination.

"The nuclear contaminant involved, americium-241,
is far more deadly than 'normal' plutonium if
inhaled, despite rosy depictions by the
laboratory's public relations office. One speck of
the material inhaled can cause cancer," Daley
said.

According to a U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency Web site, "americium poses a significant
risk if enough is swallowed or inhaled. . . . It
generally stays in the body for decades and
continues to expose the surrounding tissues to
radiation. This may eventually increase a person's
chance of developing cancer, but such cancer
effects may not become apparent for several
years."

UC manages the lab under contract to the U.S.
Department of Energy. At present, UC and a few
industrial partners, including Bechtel National,
are competing for the next Los Alamos management
contract with another team led by aerospace giant
Lockheed Martin and the University of Texas. DOE
is expected to announce the winner by Dec. 1.

UC spokesperson Chris Harrington declined Monday
to comment on the americium-241 contamination.

Los Alamos lab incident sends worker to hospital
Report hints at problems with ventilation system

Keay Davidson, Chronicle Science Writer

Thursday, August 11, 2005


In the second reported major incident in recent
days of mishandled hazardous materials at
University of California-run Los Alamos National
Laboratory, a lab employee was hospitalized for
six days with "pneumonia-like symptoms" after
inhaling dangerous fumes.

Another employee suffered temporary shortness of
breath after exposure to what an in-house
investigative report at Los Alamos called
"hazardous chemical vapors," but was not seriously
hurt.

The incident, which occurred June 16 but was not
investigated by the New Mexico lab until Aug. 3,
is still under scrutiny by lab officials. One
employee has been placed on leave pending its
resolution, lab officials said.

The investigative report hinted that something was
wrong with the lab's ventilation system, which it
called "degraded," but no further details were
available Wednesday.

Both employees were post-doctoral researchers who
were exposed to the fumes generated by the mixture
of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, according to
the investigative report.

A copy of the report by lab investigator Matthew
Hardy was leaked to news media Wednesday by a
Washington-based activist group, the Project on
Government Oversight, which is a frequent critic
of the national laboratories.

Hardy's report notes that by Aug. 5, the medical
director of Los Alamos "completed a review of all
available information as well as relevant medical
records" involving the hospitalized patient, whom
the report identifies only by the code name "W1."
According to Hardy's report, the medical director
"concluded that the chemical exposure which
occurred June 16 contributed to W1's
hospitalization."

The incident follows the lab's admission July 27
that a lab employee had apparently unintentionally
leaked radioactive material, americium-241, via a
FedEx package and other means to sites and private
homes in four states.

On Wednesday, lab officials declined comment on
either the hazardous- fumes or the americium-241
cases, pending further investigation. Lab
officials have also refused to name the employees
involved in the incidents on privacy grounds, or
to explain why one employee was placed on leave in
the hazardous- fumes case.

Accidents at the lab became a heated issue last
year when the then- director blasted employees for
carelessness in a case that included a woman whose
eyes were temporarily damaged by a laser beam and
a separate instance when an employee risked being
electrocuted. The cases disturbed lab officials
partly because they feared the adverse publicity
would end up costing UC its contract to run the
lab, which UC has managed under contract to the
federal government for six decades.

In July 2004, then-director George "Pete" Nanos
warned that employees' "almost suicidal denial" of
safety and security problems meant they were
risking losing business to other national labs.
"The tolerance of the country is at an end," he
said.

Nanos later quit for a job in Washington. He was
replaced by Robert Kuckuck, an interim director
whose main job is to keep the lab going while UC
struggles -- in collaboration with Bechtel
National and other industrial partners -- to
retain its contract for running the lab as part of
a competition with an outside consortium led by
Lockheed Martin and the University of Texas.

UC currently runs Los Alamos under contract to the
U.S. Energy Department. The department plans to
announce the winner of the competition by Dec. 1.

In a statement, Los Alamos publicists said Kuckuck
had "reminded laboratory employees that they have
the right and responsibility to stop work if they
feel that working conditions are, in any way,
unsafe." The statement also quotes Kuckuck as
saying: "The safety of individuals at this
laboratory is paramount."

Nuclear waste from 1970s, '80s recovered, FPL says

By Kristi E. Swartz

Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Tuesday, August 09, 2005

The procedures Florida Power & Light Co. and other
utilities follow for handling nuclear waste are
strict, officials say.

Even the most innocuous object that could have been 
contaminated is carefully checked.
"Even if it's a piece of notebook paper, it has to
be surveyed," said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Region II
office in Atlanta.

Those procedures have been further strengthened by
heightened security and improved technology,
company officials said Monday, a day after
revelations that in the late 1970s and early
1980s, workers at the St. Lucie Nuclear Plant
shipped radioactive waste to ordinary landfills,
municipal sewage treatment plants and some unknown
locations.

Internal documents and government records cited by
The New York Times on Sunday showed plant workers
used a sink to wash mops, rags and other heavily
contaminated materials, believing that the drain
was connected to the plant's radioactive waste
system. Instead, it drained into a sanitary sewage
system, according to the documents.

The contaminants then were hauled away with
sludge.

"It was taken out to a field. All of it was
recovered and brought back in," Al Gould, waste
manager at FPL's St. Lucie plant, said Monday.

Company spokeswoman Rachel Scott said the
contaminated materials were sent to a farm field
that was licensed by the state for nonradioactive
sludge disposal.

"It was contaminated with extremely low radiation
levels," she said. "It was comparable to a normal
background radiation level. We were told by
regulatory agencies that it was not an issue."

The level of contamination is a point of
contention between the company and the parents of
two children afflicted with cancer who have sued
FPL.

Zachary Finestone, an 11-year-old who grew up in
the area, was diagnosed with cancer in March 2000.
Ashton Lowe had brain cancer when he died at age
13 in May 2001.

The parents of both children filed suit in U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of
Florida in 2003. Finestone's case is scheduled to
go to trial in January; Lowe's trial also is
scheduled for early 2006.

On Monday, FPL officials explained some of the
procedures to which the company adheres at its
nuclear plants.

Employees who work in areas where they may pick up
contaminated material change into special clothes
before entering those sites, Scott said. All of
the laundry is done at the plant, and the water is
processed and discarded as low-level waste.

"There's federal limits on the levels of
radioactivity and how things can be disposed of,"
Scott said.

The NRC monitors how nuclear waste is handled and
classifies it into two categories: high-level and
low-level.

High-level waste is fuel. One-third of the fuel at
nuclear plants must be removed every 18 to 24
months, said Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the
Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade
association based in Washington, D.C.

During this routine maintenance time, known as a
"refueling outage," the rods that contain nuclear
fuel are removed and placed into a contained area
for spent fuel, where they remain for at least
five to seven years, Singer said.

It's the low-level waste that is more common, yet
it is handled on a daily basis with the same
scrutiny, officials say. Low-level waste includes
anything that was used inside a radiation-control
area and may have had a chance to be contaminated.

That could mean protective clothing, glass and
plastic laboratory supplies, machine parts and
tools.

"Every time you walk out of that area Ñ if you
were going to go on a tour of that plant, and you
had a camera, they would survey the camera," said
the NRC's Hannah.

Sometimes an object can be decontaminated by being
washed or wiped down. Otherwise, it's waste, Gould
said.

At that point it would be either incinerated or
compacted to reduce its volume to a tenth of the
original size, and then shipped to waste sites in
Salt Lake City or Barnwell, S.C.

"Years ago, you used to ship the waste directly,"
Gould said. "There have been enhancements in
processing, so now 500 cubic feet becomes 50 cubic
feet."

Sometimes the waste goes through additional
security measures called "transportation security
claims," Gould said, adding that he could not
discuss that in detail.

A federal law passed in 1980 made low-level
nuclear waste disposal a state responsibility.
After that, most of the states banded together in
one of 10 disposal compacts. Some states, however,
are not affiliated with a compact.

"There are only a few low-level waste sites in the
country," said David McIntyre, a spokesman for the
NRC. "There are others that are licensed to
contain or hold or dispose of radiological
materials."

Most of the low-level waste is shipped to Salt
Lake City, though the Barnwell site and another
one in Richland, Wash., also take low-level waste.

A new site is being developed near Andrews, Texas,
and nuclear plant officials are hoping to be able
to ship high-level waste to a massive disposal
site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada in the near
future.

FPL, owned by FPL Group Inc. of Juno Beach,
operates two nuclear reactors at its St. Lucie
plant on Hutchinson Island as well as two nuclear
reactors at its Turkey Point plant in Miami-Dade
County. FPL Energy, FPL Group's nonregulated
subsidiary, operates a nuclear plant in Seabrook,
N.H., and holds a majority interest in a
598-megawatt nuclear power plant just north of
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

In addition, FPL has joined with eight other
utilities to hire two companies that will design
two new nuclear-power reactors. NuStart Energy
Development LLC, which includes the two nuclear
suppliers as well as the nine power companies, is
not considering any sites in Florida, FPL has
said.

IraqÕs Children: Choir of Despair
US deeply involved in the gravest of international crimes

by Ghali Hassan

August 9, 2005
GlobalResearch.ca

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
is a wide range of specific rights and protection
measures to protect children worldwide. It is also
the most ratified international human rights
treaty ever. It strictly prohibits the abuse and
torture of children. In most Western countries,
including the US, the abuse of children is a
criminal offensive. However, this is not the case
when the crimes are committed against Iraqi
children by Western forces. It is part of the
destructive policy brought into Iraq by the US
Occupation of the country.

Contrary to Western politicians, Western media and
Western "progressives" who welcomed the illegal
war of aggression against Iraq, the plight of
Iraqi children under Occupation is worsening. On
all levels Ð human rights abuse, healthcare,
medical, educational, and psychological Ð the
Iraqi children are enduring immense hardship and
suffering. It is a cover-up of crimes against
humanity.

A recent investigation by Neil Mackay of the
Sunday Herald, has revealed that US-British forces
are holding more than 100 children in jails such
as Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca in the south.
Witnesses claim that the detainees Ð some of the
children as young as 8 years old Ð are also being
subjected to rape and torture. The investigation
is based on classified UNICEF report written in
June titled Children in Conflict with the Law or
With Coalition Forces and on reports from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Many Iraqi children were detained indefinitely
without access to their family or to lawyers.

The UNICEF report has not been released, because
UNICEF is no longer in the humanitarian business
of criticising US power and its criminal practices
of torture. UNICEF current Executive Director Ann
M. Veneman, a member of the Bush cabal and former
US secretary of Agriculture, is not likely to
offend the Bush administration by releasing the
report.

The Sunday Herald noted that a section of the
report reads: ÔInformation on the number, age,
gender and conditions of incarceration is limited.
In Basra and Karbala children arrested for alleged
activities targeting the occupying forces are
reported to be routinely transferred to an
internee facility in Um Qasr. The categorisation
of these children as ÔinterneesÕ is worrying since
it implies indefinite holding without contact with
family, expectation of trial or due processÕ. Um
Qasr is a port city on IraqÕs southern border and
isolated from the other centres. Further, Reports
from Iraq accuse the US Marines of kidnapping
children and hold them as hostages.

The ICRC reports in June 2004 that there were 107
children under 18 in six US-run prisons, but did
not provide any further information. However,
Arlie Hochschield, a professor of Sociology at the
University of California at Berkeley, noted in the
New York Times on 29 June 2005 that, "In
communications with Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch, the Pentagon has lowered the
cut-off to 16. For this reason among others, we
don't know exactly how many Iraqi children are in
American custody" because "[a]ge is not a
determining factor in [US] detention" practices.
Since the so-called handover of "sovereignty" in
June 2004, the number has risen dramatically. At
Abu Ghraib prison, where the US practices the use
of torture, "boys were sodomized with the cameras
rolling. And the worst above all of that is the
soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your
government has. They are in total terror. It's
going to come out", said investigative reporter
Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker.

Indeed, with the exception of Seymour HershÕs
investigation in May 2004, crimes of sexual
violence, rape and torture by US forces against
Iraqi men, women and children are continue to be
unreported and remain secret from the public. The
U.S. administration blamed the crimes on a few
black sheep and closed the door. Of course this is
not true. The policy of torture is part of a
secret interrogations program and comes directly
from the top of US military, with direct approval
of Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the White
House. According to Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski,
formerly in charge of Abu Ghraib prison, most of
these detainees and prisoners found to be
innocent.

Unfortunately there has been no public outrage in
the US or in Europe to condemn these appalling
practices against Iraqi men, women and children.
This silence and ignorance by Western public have
contributed to the normalisation of abuse and
torture.

The Bush administration have normalised the use of
torture by violating the rules of law, and human
rights and decency. According to Karen Greenberg,
director of the Centre on Law and Security at the
New York University School of Law, editor of ÔThe
Torture PapersÕ, the U.S. government is guilty of
a Ôsystematic decision to alter the use of methods
of coercion and torture that lay outside of
accepted and legal norms". Sanford Levinson, a
professor of constitutional law at the University
of Texas Law School, condemned the Bush
administration justice for having the power "too
close" to that of Nazi Germany.

Advocates of torture and abuse of human rights are
not difficult to find, especially among Western
elites. Obscure academics used BushÕs "war on
terror" and the illegal war on Iraq to make their
names known. In Australia, one of the new breed of
"experts" on terrorism is a certain law professor
and a former police officer by the name of Mirko
Bagaric. Professor Bagaric twists and turns his
case for torture use against presumed to be guilty
individuals to Ôextract informationÕ. However,
professor Bagaric provides no prove or evidence on
the reliability of information extracted by their
practice of torture and abuse of human rights.
"The recently published views of the Deakin
University academics have not formed in a vacuum.
A disregard for human rights is being encouraged
at the highest levels", wrote journalist Bob
Briton in the weekly Australian, The Guardian.
With these kinds of "experts" the chances of a
just world based on the rules of law is getting
bleak.

The support for torture among Westerners reflects
the denial of the educated classes and the
"progressives" that the US is deeply involved in
the gravest of international crimes. The
deliberate use of torture and the intention to
inflict harm and pain on helpless and defenceless
children is illegal, morally wrong and
counterproductive. The Bush administration policy
of torture which is in use on Iraqi men, women and
children has proved to be ineffective and sadistic
criminal practices.

It is reported that Norway and Denmark, two
members of the insignificant "coalition of the
willing" have protested against the abuse and
torture of Iraqi children. If the Norwegian and
Danish governments are serious about respecting
the rights of the Iraqi children, they should
withdraw their troops from Iraq and stop
participating in war crimes against the Iraqi
children.

The healthcare situation for children in Iraq is
very serious. According to a 2002 UNICEF survey,
the rates of acute malnutrition among children
younger than 5 in Iraq have fallen to (4 per cent)
the lowest level since they peaked in 1996, at the
highest of the genocidal sanctions. However, two
years of US occupation, it shot up to 7.7 per cent
in November 2004, according to a study conducted
by Iraq's Health Ministry in cooperation with
Norway's Institute for Applied International
Studies and the U.N. Development Program. The new
study reveals that roughly 400,000 Iraqi children
suffering from "wasting", a condition
characterized by chronic diarrhoea and dangerous
deficiencies of protein. Malnutrition appeared in
Iraq for the first time in the early 1990s, as a
result of the UN genocidal sanction forced by the
US and Britain against the Iraqi people. The
surveys suggest the silent human cost being paid
across the country as a result of US Occupation.



The Anglo-American war on Iraq since 1991 and the
violent policy implemented against the Iraqi
children were deliberately designed to destroy
Iraq as a nation. On May 12, 1996, Madeline
Albright, the former US ambassador to the United
Nations, told Lesley Stahl of CBS news program 60
Minutes, when asked to comment on the death of
half a million Iraqi children. Albright replied
without hesitation: "We think the price is worth
it". In addition, the US and Britain have refused
to lift the sanctions under any circumstances
despite known the full scale of a deliberate
atrocity. A generation of Iraqi children is lost.
Today, Iraqi children are enduring immense
hardship and suffering never before.

Report after report by the UN and aid agencies
have revealed the scale of the human tragedy
orchestrated by US-Britain policy toward Iraq, and
particularly the Iraqi children. The tragedy was
covered-up by the demonisation of Saddam Hussein
in Western media in a deliberate move to silence
the Iraqi childrenÕs cries. "We find record of not
a single significant demonstration protesting the
wholesale destruction of Iraqi children", wrote
Professor Ward Churchill of the University of
Colorado.

In the Arab World, there were no dissenting voices
to protest the slaughter of Iraqi children, but
long trends of Arab passivity and self-defence
bankruptcy. Indeed, the Arab stooges (rulers)
benefited immensely from the war and sanctions
against the Iraqi people. They are equally
complicit in war crimes against IraqÕs children

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on
March 1996 that; "Since the onset of sanctions,
there has been a six-fold increase in the
mortality rate for children under five, and the
majority of the country's population has been on a
semi-starvation diet". Denis Halliday, UN
assistant secretary general and humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq, said that sanctions are
"undermining the moral credibility of the UN" and
their continuation is "in contradiction to the
human rights provisions in the UN's own Charter".

In October 1996, UNICEF reported that "4,500
children under the age of 5 are dying each month
from hunger and diseaseÉThe situation is
disastrous for children. Many are living on the
very margin of survival". The figure means the
death of an Iraqi child every 10 minutes as a
result of the US-Britain imposed sanctions.
Philippe Heffnick of UNICEF, said; "What we are
seeing is a dramatic deterioration in the
nutritional well-being of Iraqi children since
1991É It is clear that the children are bearing
the brunt of the current economic hardship". "They
must be protected from the impact of the
sanctions. Otherwise, they will continue to suffer
and that we cannot accept", added Mr. Heffnick.

A recent United Nations World Food Programme
(UNWFP) report, found the majority of the Iraqi
population lack the required daily calories to
survive and remain healthy. Iraqi living condition
has worsened, and many Iraqis admit openly that
life before the occupation was much better and
safer. An estimated 25 percent of Iraqi babies are
born with low birth weights and the WHO warned
that many of these children will lag in their
physical or mental development, leading to
long-term health problems.

According to a United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) study conducted in 2004, infant mortality
and malnutrition findings show clearly that, '"the
suffering of children due to war and conflict in
Iraq is not limited to those directly wounded or
killed by military activities", says the UN ILCS
study. With children under the age of 15 make up
39 per cent of the countryÕs total population of
27 million, the ILCS study notes that, "Most Iraqi
children today have lived their whole lives under
sanctions and war". In other words, most Iraqi
children today have lived their lives in constant
fear of U.S-British sponsored terrorism against
children.

The "current major problems" includes "lack of
health personnel, lack of medicines,
non-functioning medical equipments and destroyed
hospitals and health centres", the ILCS study
reveals. It is a U.S-made and a U.S-accelerated
tragedy.

And as a consequence of the US war, "[h]undreds of
thousands of children born since the beginning of
the present war have had none of their required
vaccinations, and routine immunization services in
major areas of the country are all but disrupted.
Destruction of refrigeration systems needed to
store vaccines have rendered the vaccine supply
virtually useless", writes Dr. Csar Chelala, an
international public health consultant. "Even
antibiotics of minimal cost are in short supply,
increasing the population's risk of dying from
common infections. Hospitals are overcrowded, and
many hospitals go dark at night for lack of
lighting fixtures. The Iraqi minister of health
claims that 100 percent of the hospitals in Iraq
need rehabilitation", noted Csar Chelala.



IraqÕs education system, one of the best in the
Arab World before the war, has also deteriorated
by both the sanctions and the war. Again, Iraqi
children are hard hit under Occupation. The
literacy rate among Iraqi children between the
ages of 15 and 24 is just 74 per cent, which is
according to the study is only "slightly higher
than the literacy rate for the population at
large". The figure is lower than that for those
25-34, "indicating that the younger generation
lags behind its predecessors on educational
performance". According to UNICEF, almost 1 in 4
children has no access to education under the
Occupation.

The effects of "the sanctions policy not only
reversed previous educational achievements but
rendered the Iraqi education system unable to
serve the population. The impact of the sanctions
will affect future generations of school children
and university students", writes Agustin De
Santisteban, a Comparative Education specialist
with the Faculty of Education at UNED in Madrid.

The highly publicised US propaganda of IraqÕs
ÔreconstructionÕ proved to be the complete and
deliberate destruction of Iraqi education system.
The best example is found in the de-development of
IraqÕs school curriculum, on of the best in the
region. IraqÕs school curriculum has been replaced
by US-crafted curriculum in order to brainwash
Iraqi children in the same way as American
children are brainwashed.

A large number of Iraqi academics, scientists,
doctors, engineers, pharmacologists, officers, and
lawyers have been murdered or forced to flee the
country. Others are being imprisoned without
charges. Iraq is not being constructed; it is
suffering from a massive brain drain.

On 30 March 2004, Al-jazeera reported: "More than
1000 leading Iraqi professionals and intellectuals
have been assassinated since last April, among
them such prominent figures as Dr Muhammad
al-Rawi, the president of Baghdad University". The
deliberate destruction of IraqÕs human resources
designed to create a dependent and subordinate
colonial dictatorship to serve US interests and
US-Zionist hegemony.

The nation infrastructure Ð the country's service
networks, like electricity grids, communications,
bridges, irrigation, transport, sewage treatment
systems and water purification plants Ð built up
by the previous regime was largely destroyed by
the US-British indiscriminate terrorÕs bombing
began in 1991. The destruction was intentional in
order to destroy IraqÕs economy and increase the
suffering of the Iraqi people. Indeed, all targets
were selected to amplify the economic and
psychological impact of the sanctions on the Iraqi
society for many years to come.

Even after the Anglo-American troops leave Iraq,
Iraqi children will continue to suffer. Unexploded
cluster bombs, originally dropped by US-British
troops on populated areas, continue killing and
maiming children, farm animals, and wildlife-any
living thing that touches them by accident. The
bomblets are deliberately made to look like
playing things - yellow bright and look like beer
cans Ð to attract children. Thousands of children
have been killed by dormant bomblets in
Afghanistan, and Iraq.

Under Article 85 of the Geneva Conventions, it is
a war crime to launch "an indiscriminate attack
affecting the civilian population in the knowledge
that such an attack will cause an excessive loss
of life or injury to civilians." Under the Hague
Conventions, Article 22 and 23, ÔThe right of
belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy
is not unlimited", and "It is especially forbidden
to kill treacherously individuals belonging to the
hostile nation or army". However, British
officials, including Geoff Hoon, the British
defence secretary and Adam Ingram, British Armed
Forces Minister justified the use of cluster
bombs, on military grounds, saying that: "Cluster
bombs are not illegal. They are effective weapons.
They are used in specific circumstances where
there is a threat to our troops". The truth is;
cluster bombs are used often on heavily populated
areas.

According to Asia Times (10 April 2004), after US
(B52s) planes dropped their cluster bombs load,
"[a]ll over Baghdad, the city's five main
hospitals simply cannot cope with an avalanche of
civilian casualties. Doctors can't get to the
hospitals because of the bombing. Dr. Osama Saleh
Al-Dulaimi at the al-Kindi hospital confirms the
absolute majority of patients are women and
children, victims of...shrapnel and most of all,
fragments of cluster bombs. ÔThey are all
civiliansÕ, he said. ÔThe International Committee
of the Red Cross is in a state of almost
desperation...casualties arriving at hospitals at
a rate of as many as 100 per hour and at least 100
per dayÕ". In Hilla south of Baghdad, Reuters
reported scenes of children with no limbs and
babies cut in half. The majority of the 348 who
were killed or wounded by the bombs were women and
children.

The use of ÔDepletedÕ Uranium (DU) is another
scourge of the Anglo-American war on Iraq. The
long term implications of DU on Iraqi children
have been documented. DU is a potent radioactive
carcinogen and once absorbed by the body, DU can
cause cancer in the bones, lungs or kidneys. At
high risks are Iraqi children and pregnant women.
The rate of Iraqi children developing cancer and
born with cancer is significantly high.

Furthermore, the majority of the 100,000 Iraqis
killed (conservative estimate) by US-British
forces were women and children, reported the
reputed and peer-reviewed British medical journal,
The Lancet in November 2004. The Iraqiyun
Humanitarian Organization (IHO) in Baghdad
estimated that 55 per cent of the at least 128,000
Iraqis killed have been women and children aged 12
and under.  It is just non-Western lives do not
count in the West. Thousands of Iraqi children
have lost one or both parents and as a result Iraq
is awash with orphaned and homeless children.

The war was an illegal act of aggression in
contravention of UN Charter and international law.
The normalisation of this big atrocity by Western
media is shameful and lacks any moral principle.
The torture and killing of innocent Iraqi
civilians and the deliberate destruction of Iraqi
children can not be justified by countless lies
and deception. It is terrorism, not Ôfight against
terrorismÕ.

Contrary to Bush-Blair allegations, Iraq had no
link to "terrorism" or to the 9/11 attacks on the
US. BushÕs own 9/11 Commission found there was no
link between Saddam and 9/11. Iraq is not a place
for "terrorists", as Mr Bush is alleging. From an
Iraqi perspective, the "terrorists" in Iraq are US
soldiers and mercenaries from Britain, Italy,
Australia, South Korea and Japan, etc. Mr Bush is
fabricating another lie to justify the ongoing
occupation of Iraq. The Iraqi people have
legitimate right to resist foreign occupation and
liberate their country. It is clearly stated that:
"International law grants a people fighting an
illegal occupation the right to use Ôall necessary
means at their disposalÕ to end their occupation
and the occupied "are entitled to seek and receive
support" in order to resist the occupiers. The
Bush-Blair ongoing policy of violence against Iraq
is not only endangering the lives of Iraqis, but
also the lives of Americans and Britons.

Since 1991, the US and Britain embarked on a
vicious policy of dividing Iraq in the same way
the colonial Britain divided the Arab Peninsular
(into protectorates) and ruled behind a faade of
corrupt local gendarmes, kings and emirs. Every
step in the war and Occupation was deliberately
designed to destroy the Iraqi civil society and
provoke divisions and civil strife among Iraqis.

The Occupation is sowing the seeds for divisions
among Iraqis. In order to continue the Occupation
and steal IraqÕs wealth and oil resources, the US
is deliberately orchestrating civil strife. The
aim is an imperialist one, the creation of
colonial dictatorship to serve US-Israel
interests.

The US-created Iraqi "army" and "police" force are
ethnic-based militias. They constitute the
Mossad-trained Kurdish Peshmerga militia, the
Iranian-trained Badr Brigade, and the Chelabi and
Allawi thugs. Their loyalties are to their parties
and the Occupation, not to the Iraqi people. They
are responsible for widespread of crimes and fear
among the Iraqi population. The bulk of the
violence is directed against Iraqis who appose the
Occupation and US imperial agenda.



There is no "democracy" or "freedom" in Iraq.
There is no independent government; Iraq is
occupied by 200,000 US troops and mercenaries. The
current "government" in Iraq is a farce installed
by fraudulent elections. This puppet government
has betrayed the Iraqi people by failing to ask
the occupiers to leave Iraq, and to provide the
minimal security to protect the Iraqi people. Its
presence and obsequious to the occupying forces
shame every Iraqi.

The majority of Iraqis are against the Occupation
and its policies of privatization and looting of
IraqÕs resources and IraqÕs economy. The majority
of Iraqis blame the presence of US forces for the
continuing violence and mayhem. The majority of
Iraqis oppose to the US-promoted division and
"federalism" in Iraq.

In flagrant violations of UN Conventions and
international law, the US-Britain war on Iraq has
wrought nothing to Iraqis but destruction, a
culture of corruption, sectarianism, murder and
mayhem. The most vulnerable people of the Iraqi
society, women and children are the largest victim
of this atrocity. UNICEF has an obligation to the
world community to release the report and uncover
US crimes against Iraqi children.

The Occupation is destroying the lives of Iraqi
children and increasing the suffering of the Iraqi
people. The best peaceful solution for Iraq and
for the world is the immediate and full withdrawal
of the Anglo-American armies from Iraq. It is
immoral to think otherwise.

New Mexico Uranium Enrichment Plant Faces Challenge
by Brendan Coyne (bio)

Aug 8 - Two public interest groups have joined in efforts to halt or alter plans for a uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico out of concern that radioactive waste storage and transportation plans are "seriously flawed."

In a joint statement Friday, nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS), an energy and environmental education and organizing group, warned that the investors behind the proposal had not taken public concerns over the transport and storage of depleted uranium seriously.

Louisiana Energy Services, a European-led consortium of six nuclear energy firms, is proposing to build and operate a uranium enrichment facility just two miles from the Texas border and about five miles outside of Eunice, NM. The plant would provide fuel to the nationÕs nuclear power facilities and produce depleted uranium as waste.

The consortium has been attempting to find a location for a US-based private uranium enrichment plan since the 1990s, according to NIRS. The first proposed spot was in Louisiana, but public opposition forced the group to move on to Tennessee, finally landing in Eastern New Mexico.

Along the way, public interest and grassroots community groups have questioned the depleted uranium storage and transport plans. According to a report by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER), an organization billing itself as an advocate of "democratic science," LES has failed to develop an effective and safe plan during the decade it has sought to establish operations here.

Depleted uranium, infamous for its use in armor-piercing munitions, is a radioactive heavy metal and a known carcinogen.

Officials of the Regulatory Commission met throughout last week in and about the proposed site. An earlier Commission study of the site and proposal found the dangers "small to moderate," saying that an accident would result in an estimated seven cancer deaths, the Free New Mexican reported.

Citizens' Groups Expose Seriously Flawed LES Radioactive Waste Disposal Plan
Public Interest Groups Continue to Press Legal Challenge 
as Nuclear Agency Hosts Public Meeting on Its Environmental and Safety Evaluations
 

WASHINGTON - August 5 - As the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) hosts a public meeting
this evening in Eunice, New Mexico, on its
environmental and safety evaluations of a proposed
uranium enrichment plant near there, the legal
challenge being pursued by citizens groups Public
Citizen (PC) and the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service (NIRS) is bringing to light the
flawed radioactive waste disposal strategy of the
company that is seeking a license to build and
operate the plant.

PC and NIRS are engaged in an intervention against
the license application of Louisiana Energy
Services (LES), a European-led consortium, which
they contend lacks a plausible strategy for the
disposition and disposal of the very large
quantities of depleted uranium (DU)Ña long-lived
radioactive and hazardous wasteÑthat would be
produced by the plant. The issue has become the
most contentious concern in the licensing case.

"There remain serious unresolved questions about
the ultimate destination of the extremely harmful
radioactive waste that would be produced by the
LES plant," said Wenonah Hauter, director of
Public Citizen's Critical Mass energy program.
"Each option presented by LES and the NRC is
flawed, and there is a great likelihood that the
agreement between LES and the State of New Mexico
to remove the plant's waste from the State will
not be enforced."

Evaluations performed by Public Citizen and NIRS
and their expert consultants at the Institute for
Energy and Environmental Research have shown that
the waste disposal options presented by LES are
not reasonable strategies to handle the massive
amount of uranium waste that would be produced by
the plant:

---  WCS option. LES has identified the Waste Control
Specialists (WCS) site in West TexasÑless than two
miles from the site of its proposed National
Enrichment Facility (NEF)Ñas a probable disposal
destination for its DU waste. But an investigation
performed by Public Citizen and NIRS experts
reveals serious flaws in WCS's application for a
license to establish a long-term low-level
radioactive waste (LLRW) dump at its Andrew
County, Texas site. Gross inaccuracies and
misrepresentations in the application demonstrate
this company's lack of fitness to accept waste
from LES. Indeed, the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the licensing
authority in Texas, severely criticized WCS's
license application and site in a July 20 letter
to the company, warning WCS that its facility
design "appears inadequate to appropriately
stabilize certain wastes for disposal, segregate
different classes of radioactive waste, [and]
verify by testing the accurate classification of
waste received for disposal," among other
problems, such as an "inadequate" decommissioning
plan, security plan, and emergency plan.

---  Envirocare option. Envirocare of Utah, LLC, a
LLRW dump licensed by Utah to accept "Class A"
waste for disposal, is cited in the NRC's final
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as a disposal
option for LES. The NRC notes that Envirocare's
operating license authorizes it to accept DU in
oxide form in such quantities as are expected to
be produced by LES. However, recent changes in
Envirocare's operating license bring into question
whether the company may legally accept waste from
LES. In February 2005, Envirocare withdrew its
application to accept "Class B" and "Class C"
LLRWÑmore highly-radioactive formsÑfor disposal.
Though the NRC has termed depleted uranium as
low-level waste, it has not specified a
subcategory, and Public Citizen and NIRS believe
that its proper classification would be "Greater
Than Class C" waste, which would preclude
Envirocare as a disposal option. Moreover, it
appears that an amendment to Envirocare's
operating license, formally adopted on June 13,
2005, would effectively prohibit the company from
accepting depleted uranium waste in the great
quantities that would be generated by LES,
eliminating it as a disposal option.

---  DOE option. The final EIS cites the U.S.
Department of Energy's (DOE) Nevada Test Site as a
possible long-term disposal site for LES's
depleted uranium if ownership of the waste is
transferred to the DOE. However, the DOE has an
abysmal record of radioactive waste management,
exemplified by the massive stockpiles of DU waste
sitting idle at sites in Kentucky, Ohio, and
Tennessee as well as the department's failure to
properly manage the country's high-level
radioactive waste, which continues to accumulate
at nuclear power plants across the country.

---  Flawed deal with the State of New Mexico. Having
had most of its contentions excluded from hearing
in the LES licensing case, the State of New Mexico
has engaged in an effort to establish licensing
conditions for LES that would require it to
ultimately remove its DU waste from the State.
However, the enforceability of the conditions that
the parties agreed on is unclear, and the NRC
rejected the initial agreement on those grounds.
The parties have since offered a new Settlement
Agreement that no longer includes as a licensing
requirement the stipulation that the DOE not
operate a DU processing plant or dispose of DU
waste produced by LES within New Mexico. The DOE
is required to accept the plant's DU waste by law,
and it is cited in the final EIS as a disposal
option for LES. However, the NRC has made it clear
that it does not have jurisdiction over DU waste
once it is transferred to the DOE and could not
possibly enforce a condition that DOE remove such
waste from New Mexico.

---  Unrealistic cost estimates. The cost estimates
offered by LES for DU processing and disposal are
extremely low because they are based on these
flawed and implausible disposal options. Proper
disposal of LES's DU wasteÑin a deep geologic
repositoryÑwould raise LES's waste disposal
estimates exponentially.

"There is no established site in this country for
the safe, long-term disposal of depleted uranium,
and LES's half-baked plans for disposal do not
hold water," said Michael Mariotte, executive
director of NIRS. "It would not be prudent to move
forward with this new facility in the absence of a
reasonable strategy for properly disposing of this
waste."

"The net result of LES's flawed waste disposal
plans is likely to be a legacy of long-lived
radioactive waste contamination in New Mexico,"
said Hauter.

Public Citizen and NIRS will continue to challenge
the license application and waste disposal plans
of LES in hearings set for this fall.

State delivers ruling on fate of former nuclear station's concrete rubble
By Michael P. Norton/ State House News Service
Wednesday, August 10, 2005

State environmental regulators have issued a
permit that will allow Yankee Nuclear Power
Station in Rowe to use concrete rubble as onsite
fill as long as it is considered "environmentally
and radiologically clean."

However, the state Department of Environmental
Protection denied Yankee's request to use
tritium-contaminated concrete rubble as fill and
its request to leave subsurface foundations and
other structures intact if radioactivity in those
structures is "above background levels."

DEP regional director Michael Gorski said those
background levels are subject to determination.

Under the decision, contaminated rubble will need
to be transported to licensed facilities, the
Carolinas, Utah or Texas, Gorski said.

"That would have to get shipped off site," he told
the News Service.

In decommissioning the station, Yankee officials
had applied for a DEP permit to leave building
foundations in the ground and fill foundation
voids and other excavated areas with more than 20
million pounds of concrete rubble from the
demolition of on-site structures. In a statement,
DEP Commissioner Robert Golledge explained that
agency's decision to limit the reuse of station
rubble.

"While the risk posed to the public by Yankee's
proposal may be low, tritium-contaminated rubble
is low-level radioactive waste which can not be
left onsite," he said. "Further interring the
material onsite may exacerbate or complicate the
clean up of existing soil and groundwater
contamination at the site."

Yankee Rowe spokeswoman Kelley Smith said company
officials received the permit Friday but can't
comment on it until regulators answer some
technical questions.

"We have multiple regulators for this
decommissioning project and we have to satisfy all
of them," she said, mentioning the DEP, state
Department of Public Health and the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Yankee Rowe Station shut down in 1992 and
decommissioning, which began in 1993, is now in
its final stages. All above-ground structures,
which covered 10 acres on an 1,800 acre site owned
by Yankee, have been demolished.

Smith said Yankee Rowe officials are required to
clean the site to the extent that would "allow the
hypothetical resident farmer to live on the site,"
but spent fuel at the site will likely not be
removed for years because the operation of a
federal repository for nuclear waste in Nevada
won't begin until 2012 at the earliest, Smith
said.

"In reality, because the federal government has
failed to meet their contractual obligation to
remove spent fuel from nuclear plants, Yankee Rowe
must continue to store its spent nuclear fuel on
the former plant site, which will preclude the
public use of the site," she said.

Controversial bomb tests proposed at lab
$4 billion Livermore laser proposal worries some fusion observers
By Ian Hoffman, STAFF WRITER
The Oakland Tribune 

U.S. weapons scientists want to fire the world's
largest laser at targets resembling miniature atom
bombs in experiments aimed at a deeper
understanding of the physics in thermonuclear
weapons.

Critics say the experiments could lead to new,
low-yield nuclear explosives.

Details of the proposed experiments and their
purposes are classified, though weapons scientists
say they are not pursuing new kinds of nuclear
bombs.

If approved by federal weapons authorities at the
U.S. Department of Energy, the laser shots would
mark an unprecedented use of weapons-grade
plutonium and uranium in a U.S. fusion facility.
Shots on the new targets could begin in 2010 at
the National Ignition Facility, a massive laser
complex at Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons lab.

In the 1990s and again in a recent environmental
study, weapons scientists and federal defense
officials said the experiments could fill gaps in
understanding of critical aspects of weapons
physics.

But Clinton administration weapons officials
called the experiments "highly speculative" and
told a 1995 panel of scientists studying NIF's
implications for development of new weapons that
"there is no intention on the part of the
Department to pursue these experiments.

When complete in 2008, NIF would be scientists'
best shot in a half-century of ion guns, magnetic
chambers and other big lasers at creating a tiny
star inside a laboratory through pure fusion Ñ
that is, without using a fission bomb as a
lighting match, as in H-bombs.

But with the new, classified targets, weapons
scientists would be departing from pure fusion and
exploring thermonuclear explosions on targets very
similar to an atom bomb, with concentric shells of
beryllium and weapons-grade plutonium Ñ just a
gram or two of each Ñ containing a mix of two
heavy hydrogen gases, tritium and deuterium.

That's almost identical to the first stage of a
thermonuclear weapon, a grapefruit-sized hollow
ball of beryllium and plutonium surrounded by high
explosives that serve as a fission match to touch
off fusion.

The experiment and the bomb differ in size and
shape Ñ modern primaries tend to be oblong, shaped
like eggs or watermelons Ñ and they differ in the
means of detonation: imploding high explosives for
nuclear bombs versus a crushing fist of X-rays
created by 192 beams of intense laser light inside
the Rose Bowl-sized National Ignition Facility.

"What they're doing is trying to make a miniature
H-bomb, not a pure fusion explosion. They're on a
totally different page than the rest of the fusion
community," said Ray Kidder, a former senior
manager over laser research at Lawrence Livermore
and a nonproliferation advocate.

The reason, he said, is obvious to anyone in the
weapons world.

"The answer is to design new weapons, weapons that
have different characteristics and are based on a
different way of making the weapon detonate,"
Kidder said. "This is an absolutely whole new ball
game."

Some other fusion scientists are also concerned
that the classified experiments could taint the
international pursuit of fusion energy.

Stefan Atzeni, a physicist at the University of
Rome and co-author of a definitive textbook on
laser fusion, said he understands the need of U.S.
scientists to learn more about weapons physics.
But he opposes the use of weapons-grade plutonium
in fusion experiments.

"Personally, I see these experiments as
politically risky," he wrote in an e-mail last
week. "They certainly would not have a positive
impact on public perception of fusion: They may be
viewed as supporting weapons proliferation."

The Clinton and Bush administrations concluded
that NIF posed no proliferation risks in part
because of the laser's enormous size and cost Ñ it
could

not be replicated into a feasible weapon Ñ and
because experiments on NIF could yield rare
insights into physics at the extreme temperatures,
energies and pressures found only in stars and
nuclear weapons.

Some physicists, including the late Theodore
Taylor, a weapons designer turned arms-control
advocate, warned that the giant laser might open
the door to novel fusion weaponry, driven by high
explosives or magnetic fields.

Such experiments could make it harder for the
United States to persuade the United Nations to
limit other nations' nuclear research, said
Christopher Paine, a senior weapons analyst for
the Natural Resources Defense Council.

"How does the United States look objecting to the
nuclear energy programs of other countries while
it injects weapons research functions into its
search for fusion energy?" Paine said. "It puts us
in a frightfully hypocritical position."

This new class of weapons would turn the operation
of existing H-bombs inside out. Since the 1950s,
virtually all nuclear weapons in the arsenals of
advanced nuclear powers have been "boosted"
designs. They inject fusion fuel into detonating
atom bomb of plutonium and use the fusion
reactions to split even more plutonium atoms. That
dramatically raises the efficiency of the atom
bomb, allowing weapons designers to shrink their
size and weight as fission triggers for
thermonuclear weapons.

A possible new class of weapons is closer to
fusion bombs, using nuclear fission as a booster.

In some of the classified experiments proposed for
the National Ignition Facility, scientists would
fire at a pellet that looks rather like an atom
bomb but is 100 times smaller. If the target works
Ñ if it implodes perfectly and doesn't squirt out
to the sides Ñ the pellet would be crushed smaller
still, and the hydrogen fusion fuel inside would
fuse, releasing trillions of neutrons.

Some neutrons will shatter the atomic nuclei of
the plutonium and produce hot fragments that
deliver scads of energy back into the fusion fuel,
making it burn more efficiently. The plutonium
becomes an explosive to boost a tiny fusion bomb.

"It's 100 percent about new nuclear weapons that
are just what people are looking for because
they're low-yield weapons with reduced residual
radiation," said Kidder, the retired Livermore
laser physicist.

Weapons scientists would not discuss the
experiments in detail, saying they are classified.
But in response to written questions, scientists
at Livermore who declined to be identified
stressed that the experiments strictly were
intended to improve the understanding of ordinary
H-bombs. The classified shots are not "relevant to
any new design," they wrote.

It is narrowing uncertainties in weapons physics,
not exploring new weapons, that is the rationale
for the classified experiments, according to
Livermore's scientists.

If so, Kidder asks, why the secrecy?

"You put fission into it, and the world has to be
kept out," Kidder said. "I would prefer they did
not do any fusion experiments with fission that
were classified. But the whole idea of doing
things in a dark corner and doing things that
could lead toward proliferation, I don't favor
that."

Consolidate nuclear-bomb-making plants, panel says

By JAMES W. BROSNAN
Scripps Howard News Service
October 05, 2005

WASHINGTON - An advisory panel is telling the
Department of Energy to consolidate its
nuclear-bomb-making facilities into one isolated,
secure site to make a new generation of warheads.

The recommendation from the Energy Advisory Board,
if adopted by the administration and Congress,
would mean a loss of jobs from some of the
nation's historic weapons laboratories, including
Oak Ridge, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore.

The report also questions why the department needs
three expensive supercomputers, Red Storm at
Sandia, Q at Los Alamos and Blue Gene at
Livermore.

The nuclear-weapons complex is now spread among
five different facilities, including the three
design labs, Sandia and Los Alamos in New Mexico,
Livermore in California, and two production
facilities, the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee and the Pantex plant near
Amarillo, Texas.

"All of the production elements are quite old and
antiquated and we propose that all should be
replaced," said David Overskei, chairman of the
board's Nuclear Weapons Complex Infrastructure
Task Force and president of Decision Factors Inc.
of San Diego.

Overskei said the threat of espionage dictated
that the complex be spread out in the 1940s and
'50s, but now the threat is terrorism.

Destroy any of the "five single points of failure"
and "you have lost the ability to produce a
nuclear weapon," said Overskei.

Even a "partially successful" terrorist attack on
Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, the Y-12 plant or
the Pantex site "may cause collateral damage" to
the surrounding civilian populations, the report
said.

The cost of physical security now consumes 11
percent of the weapons complex's budget and is
expected to rise to 15 percent by 2010, an
"unsustainable trend," the report said.

The report acknowledged the "tremendous science
and engineering competence" at Los Alamos,
Livermore and Sandia, but said, "Nonetheless, the
weapons laboratories of the future will likely
have smaller nuclear weapons program staff than
they have today."

When one public commenter asked Overskei how they
would move all the expertise from the existing
sites to one location, he responded, "A lot of the
skills and expertise that exists in the current
complex is not the expertise you would apply to
the complex of the future."

The report drew a cautious response from Energy
Secretary Samuel Bodman.

Many of its recommendations "are consistent with
DOE initiatives already under way to modernize the
nuclear weapons complex and consolidate special
nuclear material," said Bodman in a statement.

But, he added, "Some of the more sweeping
proposals could have significant budget impacts
that will have to be assessed very carefully."

Bodman directed Linton Brooks, administrator of
the National Nuclear Security Administration, to
make that assessment.

Overskei said the single weapons-production
facility could be built by canceling projects at
some of the labs or by adding $1 billion to $2
billion a year to the Energy Department's budget
for the next five to six years.

The report did not recommend a location for the
production facility, but mentioned the existing
Nevada Test Site as a possibility.

DeLay's Corporate Defenders
by Andrew Wheat

The legal defense fund of Congressman Tom
DeLay-who is facing criminal indictment as a
result of an addiction to corporate political
contributions-is spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars in additional corporate funds to help
DeLay beat his criminal rap. Not surprisingly,
many of the contributors to DeLay's defense fund
have business before Congress, where this
congressman is still an invaluable ally.

Since 2000, when DeLay began fighting what became
a slew of House ethics complaints, his legal
defense fund has raised more than $1.4 million.
This fund has bagged more than $900,000 since
2002, when DeLay's Texans for a Republican
Majority PAC (TRMPAC) spent $600,000 in corporate
funds to help establish a GOP majority in the
Texas House-despite Texas' prohibition on
corporate electioneering. A little-noticed irony
of DeLay's legal defense fund is that it is
raising much of its money from the very type of
political donors that precipitated DeLay's
indictment. More than 100 corporations have
contributed in excess of $400,000 to DeLay's
defense fund, or 28 percent of all the money
raised, according to data compiled by Public
Citizen's Congress Watch. The defense fund's top
four corporate donors-Contran, Reliant, RJ
Reynolds, and Panda Energy-spent $3.5 million
lobbying DeLay and other federal officials over
the past five years.

"DeLay is so addicted to corporate money that he
is now accepting it to fight charges that he
laundered it," said Conor Kenny, with the federal
watchdog group Congress Watch. "The man lacks any
sense of decency or, apparently, irony."

RJ Reynolds (RJR) not only gave DeLay's legal
defense $17,000, the tobacco giant also provided
the corporate jet that whisked DeLay to Houston
last month for fingerprinting and to take the mug
shot seen 'round the world. RJR previously
provided job training for Jim Ellis, who would go
on to direct DeLay's national political action
committee Americans for a Republican Majority.
Ellis is now an indicted co-conspirator along with
DeLay for his work with TRMPAC. But back in 1993,
Ellis co-founded RJR's front group, Ramhurst Corp.
Through "smokers' rights" and other campaigns this
RJR-financed company opposed smoking restrictions,
tobacco taxes, and FDA regulation of tobacco. In
recent years RJR has spent $1.7 million on federal
lobbyists, including the Alexander Strategy Group,
run by former DeLay aides Ed Buckham, Tony Rudy,
and Karl Gallant. When the Senate moved an
FDA-regulation bill last year, Tom DeLay was there
to send it up in smoke in the House.

Alexander Strategy also lobbies for Huntsman
Chemical, which gave $5,000 in corporate funds to
DeLay's legal defense fund; Huntsman executives
threw in $10,000 more of their own money. Huntsman
is a major producer of MTBE. This chemical
additive makes gasoline burn cleaner but also has
polluted groundwater around the country. A massive
congressional energy bill died in 2003 after the
Senate rejected a House provision that would have
shielded MTBE makers from toxic lawsuits. The
House revived this provision this year but
senators stripped it from the final energy bill
that President Bush signed into law in August.
Huntsman spent almost $1.5 million in recent years
on federal lobbyists, including former Texas
Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes and lobbyists at
the law firm of Bracewell Giuliani, which is part
of DeLay's legal defense team.


Dallas corporate raider Harold Simmons is a major
source of support for DeLay's legal defense fund.
Simmons controls the holding companies Contran
Corp. and Valhi, Inc., which gave $10,000 apiece
toward DeLay's defense. Simmons personally gave
the legal fund another $10,000. A major GOP donor
at the state and federal levels, Simmons controls
a vast commercial empire that has spent $735,000
on federal lobbyists in the past five years.

Simmons is best known in Texas for his controlling
interest in Waste Control Specialists (WCS), which
spent a decade and up to $5 million lobbying the
state to secure permits to open nuclear waste
dumps in West Texas. WCS also has spent $175,000
lobbying the federal government in recent years.
This year it snagged a contract to take 3,500
truckloads of radioactive waste from a federal
bomb plant in Ohio.

Texas lobbyist Kent Hance recruited Simmons to
invest in WCS. Hance represented the Louisiana
Coushatta tribe while DeLay's indicted lobbyist
crony, Jack Abramoff, fraudulently billed the
tribe some $32 million. This year Hance's law firm
Hance Scarborough Wright Ginsberg and Brusilow
unsuccessfully defended TRMPAC Treasurer Bill
Ceverha in a civil suit. A state judge ruled in
May that Ceverha broke Texas law by failing to
disclose TRMPAC's corporate contributions to state
officials.

Reliant Energy, a $20,000 corporate donor to
DeLay's defense fund, spent more than $1 million
lobbying the federal government in the past five
years. Reliant gave $25,000 in corporate funds to
TRMPAC in 2002, the same year that it threw an
Abramoff-attended baby shower for DeLay's
daughter, Danielle Ferro. (In 2002 Ferro worked as
a TRMPAC consultant, banking $30,000 for her
efforts.) One of Reliant's top federal lobby firms
is the Federalist Group, which employs former
DeLay legislative director Drew Maloney. Maloney
helped DeLay set up a 2002 golf tournament in
which Reliant and other energy firms that
contributed to DeLay PACs got to tee off with the
then-House majority leader on the eve of a
House-Senate conference on an omnibus energy bill.
Last year the House ethics committee rebuked DeLay
for this outing, which it said created the
appearance of selling political access.

Dallas-based Panda Energy has given $10,000 to
DeLay's legal defense fund; CEO Bob Carter
personally chipped in another $5,000. After
building power plants in Nepal and China, Panda
complained that these governments failed to honor
power-purchasing contracts. Despite modest lobby
expenditures, Panda found traction with its Nepali
complaint in Congress. Nepal News reported this
year that Republican members of Congress agreed to
support duty-free imports of Nepali clothing-if
the Nepal electric utility works out $3 million in
debts to Panda.

It is still too early to say if the corporate
money that got Tom DeLay into serious legal
trouble can bail him out of it. What is clear is
that-in the twisted world of politics-DeLay's
legal troubles present special interests with yet
another way to curry favor with one of the most
powerful members of Congress.

Andrew Wheat is research director for Austin-based
Texans for Public Justice.

UT System may house nuclear reactor in 2012
Site could reprocess waste from plants, perform research

By Yashoda Sampath 

The University of Texas System will host the first
high-temperature nuclear reactor in the country by
2012.

UT-Permian Basin in Odessa is working with the
nuclear consulting company General Atomics to
build the test reactor in Andrews County in West
Texas. Andrews County recently became home to all
of the nation's low-level radioactive waste.

"That helps us because we already have facilities
for waste storage treatment and disposal," said
Jim Wright, project coordinator at UT-Permian
Basin

Generation IV, a consortium of international
governments, power companies and researchers
formed by the U.S. Department of Energy, made a
rule that the United States must update all
nuclear reactors by 2030. The proposed reactor
would be the first in the United States.

The Andrews reactor would be used to test and
conduct research for a proposed commercial reactor
in Idaho.

"We believe that this country is in a position
where all the nuclear technology is being
developed in other places," said Wright.

Japan and China have already constructed reactors
with the new high-temperature technology, which
would go up to 1,000 degrees Celsius.

The new reactor will have three primary
experimental uses: nuclear research on the fuel
cycle, which follows uranium usage from start
until finish; hydrogen production; and
high-temperature research.

Until now, waste was not reprocessed, as the
reprocessing produces plutonium, and the United
States didn't want plutonium to proliferate during
the Cold War, Wright said. Now, the plutonium and
uranium would be used together to fuel the
reactor. Experiments will also be conducted with
an element called thorium, which is
self-generating - when burned it creates more fuel
to use. This decreases the initial amount needed
for a reaction. Wright added that thorium is a
much more abundant mineral than uranium.

The facility will also research hydrogen fuel
production. The high temperatures of the test
reactor can convert water directly to hydrogen
without using a catalyst, said Wright. This won't
create any waste product and will be the most
efficient way to get hydro-powered cars and houses
on the market, he said.

Karen Hadden, co-director of the environmental
advocacy group SEED Coalition, said that the idea
of using a nuclear reactor to create clean energy
is a contradiction.

"I don't think it's a good idea for UT to be
involved in this," she said. "We already are
bidding for Los Alamos and already manage Sandia,
in addition to the reactor at the Pickle Campus. I
would characterize this as nuclear madness."

The reactor will not be involved in weapons
production, but will be used to research the best
methods of recycling disused nuclear weapon
elements from the Cold War.

To counteract any attempts at theft, the reactor
will be fully underground. Additionally, the fuel
for the reactor will be deeply encased within
three layers of ceramic, making up spheres .8
millimeters in diameter. The ceramic spheres are
then encased in blocks of graphite.

"Terrorists would have to separate literally
millions of the spheres in order to get enough
fuel," Wright said.

Wright said the reactor shuts itself down
automatically when it reaches 1,500 degrees
Celsius. The ceramic coating withstands
temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. Together, these
safety measures would eliminate the possibility of
nuclear meltdowns, Wright said. The ceramic
coatings would also function as safe storage.

The disasters of Chernobyl in Russia and Three
Mile Island in Pennsylvania were caused by using
water coolant, which overflowed and led to
overheating and meltdown. The test reactor would
instead use gas coolant.

The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club questions
using nuclear research, regardless of the
benefits. Spokeswoman Donna Hoffman cited nuclear
waste as a pressing issue.

"Los Alamos radioactivity is already migrating
underground to the Rio Grande River," she said.
"We should have learned our lesson by now."

Wright said with the new technology, waste would
be reduced by half. Efficiency, currently
estimated at 33 percent, will increase to more
than 50 percent.

Researchers from the UT System and Sandia and Los
Alamos National Laboratories will collaborate with
UTPB's project.

Estimates put the reactor's final price tag at
around $400 million, Wright said. The federal
government will pay for 90 percent, and UTPB would
look for private sources for the remainder.
Already, $3 million has been raised to fund
preliminary designs, which will be shown to
potential investors.

Andrews eyes nuclear test reactor
UTPB, General Atomics, Andrews officials discuss building next-generation plant

By David J. Lee
Odessa American

UTPB and General Atomics are looking at a new type
of nuclear technology Ñ one that could fuel both
electricity and transportation Ñ and they'd like
to put a reactor here in West Texas.

University of Texas of the Permian Basin President
David Watts said San Diego-based General Atomics
has developed the nuclear program based on
technology used overseas.

"It uses technology that has been adopted in
China, Japan and is under consideration for
adoption in South Africa," Watts said. "The point
is that the technology is inherently safe. It is a
new development in nuclear reactor technology."

While still only in the discussion stage, Watts
said UTPB and General Atomics would like to
develop a Very High Temperature Test Nuclear
Reactor.

"Since this technology has not been used anywhere
in the United States, we believe that the
opportunity is ripe for the design and
construction of this Very High Temperature Test
Reactor," Watts said. "We hope it will be sited in
Andrews County."

Andrews City Manager Glen Hackler said it doesn't
appear the city or county is averse to that.

On Tuesday, UTPB officials presented the idea of
the reactor, as well as the possibility of putting
it in Andrews, to the city, county, economic
development board and industrial base of the West
Texas community.

"After the meeting, I milled around with quite a
few of the people there, and the reaction I got
was constantly favorable of people from Andrews,"
Hackler said. "I think it's got a real appeal from
a conceptual standpoint."

The concept of the Very High Temperature Test
Nuclear Reactor is one that could provide both
electric energy and hydrogen fuel. The reactor
process also creates the sulfur-iodine technology
for hydrogen production.

"This technology, because of the high heat it
generates, promises to bring a variety of new
economically powerful applications here, such as
production of cheap hydrogen," Watts said. "This
technology may be the answer to the question of
how do you have a cheap and reliable source of
hydrogen for a hydrogen-based economy."

Even more, the technology Ñ which has been tested
in Asian countries Ñ is inherently safe, Watts
said.

"There is no risk of any kind of nuclear
meltdown," he said. "It is a new technology,
presently unlike anything used in the United
States for nuclear reactors."

In a letter General Atomics Senior Vice President
David Baldwin wrote to Watts, Baldwin said a
concept design, which is needed to apply for
grants, would cost about $3 million. The money
would be raised through grants and outside
donations, he said. The cost of the reactor would
run about $100 million.

"It is anticipated that, once these facilities are
built, they would be operated by UTPB and/or its
designees," Baldwin wrote. "The research faculty
at UTPB will use this facility to not only support
the development of the (Next Generation Nuclear
Plant) but also energy research in cooperation
with other national and international
organizations."

Dr. James "Jim" Wright, project director for the
nuclear proposal, said a test plant in Andrews
would pave the way for a full-scale Next
Generation Nuclear Plant elsewhere.

"The Very High Temperature Test Reactor to be
built by UTPB and General Atomics, we believe it
is a logical technology stepping stone to the Very
High Temperature Reactor," Wright said. "It will
be used to (a) test and verify many of the
required technologies, and (b) refine the nuclear
fuel cycle, before they are tried in the much more
expensive Next Generation Nuclear Plant."

Meanwhile, Watts and Hackler both said the
possibility of a project is a long way off Ñ
Tuesday's meeting was solely an informational talk
to get community reaction of the idea.

"They're talking about trying a feasibility study
in a year," Hackler said. "If that's successful
and there's a general receptiveness in our
community, the timeline for the reactor is five or
six years."

Watts said the university has long been interested
in finding alternative energy sources, which led
to its relationship with General Atomics.

"UTPB has been involved in energy research for
some time and began to explore the nuclear area
and formed a partnership with General Atomics,
which has developed the technology we're
interested in seeing applied in a test nuclear
reactor," Watts said.

Hackler said Andrews officials were impressed with
the presentation Tuesday.

"For Andrews, having the UT system involved gives
it great credibility," Hackler said. "General
Atomics and their 50-year history in nuclear
technology and the nuclear research field gives it
great credibility."

Watts said Andrews seemed like a logical choice.

"We believe that the city and county of Andrews Ñ
which has had a substantial discussion over
decades regarding the operation of nuclear
faculties such as Water Control Systems and
Louisiana Exploration Services, directly adjacent
to Waste Control Systems Ñ would consider allowing
this project to be sited in their county," Watts
said.

Hackler said he would hope a test reactor would
actually eliminate some of the stigma Andrews has
gotten with the nuclear waste sites.

"We get the stigma that goes with being a nuclear
waste landfill site or waste disposal site," he
said. "It'd be nice to have the prestige that
comes with a major research-development,
world-class facility for nuclear energy right here
in the Permian Basin in our county."

Exelon studies 8 Texas sites for nuclear reactor

Reuters
Friday, October 6, 2006; 8:35 PM

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exelon Corp. (EXC.N), the largest U.S. nuclear power producer, said it is "actively" evaluating eight sites in Texas as possible locations for a new nuclear reactor, a spokesman said on Friday.

Chicago-based Exelon, which entered the Texas generation market in 2002 with the purchase of two aging natural gas-fired power plants from TXU Corp. (TXU.N), became the fourth company last week to say it wants to apply for a license to build a nuclear plant in Texas to meet growing power needs.
	
Of the 19 preliminary proposals for new U.S. reactors, Texas has attracted the most interest, with four proposals, according to data from the Nuclear Energy Institute.

The industry, dormant since the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear station in Pennsylvania, is undergoing a rebirth amid growing environmental concern about carbon emissions from fossil-fuel plants and rising costs of natural gas.

President George W. Bush supports new nuclear construction and energy legislation passed in 2005 offers billions of dollars in incentives to owners of the first new plants to go into service.

Two other Texas generators, NRG Energy Inc. (NRG.N) and TXU Corp., have proposed new reactors in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which serves about 85 percent of the state's power needs. In addition, an Amarillo-based real estate developer is working to attract a reactor to the panhandle region, outside ERCOT.

Exelon has not disclosed the size of the nuclear plant it is considering in Texas, but has narrowed its choice of reactor design to the General Electric ES Boiling Water Reactor of the Westinghouse Advanced Passive 1000 design, according to its letter of intent filed with federal regulators.

Princeton, New Jersy-based NRG owns 44 percent of the 2,560-megawatt South Texas Project, located southwest of Houston, while Dallas-based TXU owns 100 percent of 2,300-MW Comanche Peak station southwest of Fort Worth.

In June, NRG proposed adding two reactors, totaling 2,700 MW, at the South Texas location.

TXU said it was studying an expansion at Comanche Peak but did not disclose how much capacity it might build. TXU also said it was looking at other sites in Texas and sites outside the state.

Exelon spokesman Craig Nesbit said the company is pursuing a new Texas reactor on its own, but he would not dismiss the idea of a partnership with one of the other companies. "I would never shut the door on anything," he said.

Both NRG and TXU have said they would like to reduce the risk of building new reactors by attracting partners.

Exelon filed its letter with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission September 29, three days after TXU Chairman C. John Wilder told analysts in New York that the companies had dropped plans to swap assets.

Wilder said TXU was interested in an "asset swap" with Exelon to expand its generation outside Texas while helping Exelon alleviate market-power concerns related to its proposed merger with Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG.N).

Exelon called off the $17.7 billion merger in mid-September, citing problems obtaining approval of the deal in New Jersey.

TXU, already the largest power generator in Texas, faces market-power limits as it seeks permits to build 9,000 MW of coal-fired generation to be completed before any new nuclear plants.

Exelon is also considering adding reactors in Illinois and as part of NuStart, a 12-member consortium looking at sites in Tennessee and Mississippi.
