-------------------------- Education/ Professional Development
10/2015 - 06/2016
New Horizons - Security IT Professional program -  4.0 GPA
   --  After obtaining CompTIA Network+, Security+ and CCNA exams alone, ran out of money
   --   Obtained grant to continue certifications
	  --   Added: CASP, CEH, CHFI, LPIC1/Linux+
	  --   Unfortunately the funding would not cover costs for Red Hat exams.

09/2010 - Present  
Independent Study - Enterprise Linux, Network Systems and Security
  --  In 2010 mission undertaken to tailor skillset to better suit the modern enterprise with cloud provisioning and infosec 
  --  Expanded upon Red Hat RHCSA/RHCE topics to also cover Debian and FreeBSD. (RHEL 6 and 7 materials)
  --  Refreshed network concepts (TCP/IP, subnetting, infrastructure with Cisco), updated on security tools, Kali Linux
  --  Early 2015, began collecting certifications to prove skill in hiring process, obtained NH grant.
  --  Recently (Summer 2016) refreshed materials on:
	  --  OpenStack (8hr class - Administering OpenStack on the Command Line)
	  --  RHCE (Sander Vugt's 8hr RHCE class)
	  --  pfSense firewall (complete in-depth overview)
	  --  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
	  --  VMware ESXi, NSX (VCA-DCV material- too easy!)
	  --  Docker, Puppet, Git

  --  Added first tier technical support and troubleshooting for Win XP/7 and Mac OS X.  
  --  Since simple clerical work was consistently done ahead of schedule,
   -> Encouraged by supervisors to devote surplus time to studying:
	  --  Modified RHCSA/RHCE curriculum to include Debian and BSD equivalents.
	  --  Used Cisco materials for network technologies (CCNA, CompTIA)
	  --  Prioritized Python and C++ as languages of choice
	  --  Continued security work on Kali Linux
	  --  Introduced to Ruby and turned onto OpenStack

   -> During this project, the "dot-com bubble" burst. It was nice to work on science, but passion was in technology and it never stopped working:
	  --  Used initial versions of Backtrack* for penetration testing of wireless security
	  --  Decided to drop web design/programming to focus on systems/ network administration.
	  --  Evaluated the rise of Ubuntu, emergence of Gentoo, and evolution of Red Hat.
	  --  Kept up-to-date on changes to Windows Server and Mac OS X
	  --  Open source package management solutions for OSX like DarwinPorts, Homebrew
