<title>Texas Radiation Online- History of RadWaste Disposal in Texas</title>

<head><link REL=stylesheet href="styles.css"></head>




<span class="newstdtext12">

<B>Prelude to Sierra Blanca</B><BR>
In 1980, US Congress passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (LLRWPA), (Public Law 96-573)
(42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2021b-2021j), which directed 
that states form multistate compacts to develop regional disposal sites for "low-level" waste.  This decision
was emphasized in 1985 when Congress amended the LLRWPA in 1985 with the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy
Amendments Act (Public Law 99-240).  Texas lawmakers had created the Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority (LLRWDA) in 1981 to develop and operate a facility, or as one official put it,
to seek "the best darn landfill man has ever seen."
  The Texas Compact itself was not ratified by US Congress until early 1998 during the 
massive effort to burden Sierra Blanca as a dump site.
<BR><BR>
There was also a concern in the mid-1980's about a possible high-level waste dump in Texas.
The DOE's search for a high-level "geologic repository" was underway and Deaf Smith County had passed the first 
round of screenings, along with Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Washington, and Mississippi.  This later was decided 
to be sited at Yucca Mountain.
<BR><BR>


Originally, the Texas waste site was to have been south of San Antonio on
privately owned land, but a law was passed mandating the site be located on
state-owned land which eliminated virtually all sites in central, south, and
east Texas. (AP 1991)  
The LLRWDA spent several years seeking possible
sites for a commercial disposal facility, starting 
with statewide screenings including Dimmit and Deaf Smith counties,
and attempting to place sites in Dell City, Hudspeth Co. in 1983-84;
McMullen County in 1985-87; and in Ft Hancock, Hudspeth Co. from 1987-91.  

<BR><BR> 

These attempts to site a waste dump were abandoned
due to local opposition and geologic unsuitability.  For example, in the case of 
 Fort Hancock, data had already been presented at TLLRWDA briefings in 1986 that the
 cretaceous aquifer underneath was vulnerable, as well as drainage to
  the Hueco Bolson and Rio Grande Alluvium aquifer systems, which the town of Fort Hancock
  used as a water supply.  It was stated that run-off from the site also clearly flowed 
  into the Rio Grande drainage basin,and it was recommended that the siting be dismissed.
  This was not deemed to be important by the TLLRWDA and they pushed forward with their objective.
 <BR><BR>
After the TLLRWDA 
selected Fort Hancock as the preferred
site in 1989, neighboring El Paso County and 
other parties challenged the site in a lawsuit. 
In January 1991, State District
Judge William Moody declared the site unsuitable and
ordered work on it stopped.   After nearly a decade of being consistently stopped by
public opposition, the TLLRWDA and it's supporters were getting impatient. 
Although previously rejected 
by the agency, the TLLRWDA returned to Sierra Blanca, ignoring the geologic unsuitability they had found
in a manner quite similar to Fort Hancock.


<BR><BR>

<B>The Sierra Blanca State Compact Dump (1991-1998)</B><BR>

 The 72nd
Legislature directed the TLLRWDA to select another
disposal site within a 400-square-mile designated area
in Hudspeth County (this designation was later nicknamed "The Box").
 The authority chose a site known as Faskin Ranch about five miles southeast of Sierra Blanca and applied to
TNRCC for a waste disposal facility license in 1992. 

In 1983, when the agency had hired an engineering consultant group to evaluate sites across the state,
it had stated that the land containing the Sierra Blanca site was unsuitable.
Despite this, the TLLRWDA said that it did not have complete environmental
 studies of the site before targeting it, and that only after purchasing the land did the agency realize that 
 the site was located directly above an earthquake fault.  Like in the Fort Hancock case, the TLLRWDA pushed 
 forward with the site anyway, despite the data on site suitability.
 <BR><BR>
 Sierra Blanca is 76 miles southeast of El Paso, and 16 miles from Mexico and the Rio 
Grande.  Even though it is the county seat of Hudspeth County, it didn't have its own
 sewage system or more than a few paved streets.  Of the nearly 800 people who live there, 
 40% live in poverty, and 67% are Mexican American.  
  65 earthquakes over a 3.0 magnitude had occured 
 within 200 miles of Sierra Blanca the previous 70 years.  High rates of erosion were prevalent when digging, 
 due to the desert winds and sandy soil.  The 100-year floodplain of nearby Grayton Lake was adjacent to the
 site, and undergound fractures and faults promised a pathway for contamination to infiltrate the groundwater.
    In 1997, the City of El Paso had bought land near the site from 
 which they hoped to pump El Paso's future drinking water.

 <BR><BR>
  [MERCO Joint Ventures and Texas Tech University had just recently obtained a permit to build what turned into 
  the largest sewage dump in the world at Sierra Blanca, recieving 250 tons of "partially treated" New York City 
  sewage sludge by rail each week.  The site supposedly produced fertilizer, or "biosolids" out of the sludge by 
  spraying the toxic slurry of heavy metals over the land to dry.  This operation continued for nearly 10 years,
   assaulting the health of the residents and testing their tolerance for the noxious odors.
   
  The sludge site was licensed in a record 23 days, with the help of former legislator and former state water board 
  commissioner Cliff Johnson (Johnson will resurface later as a key lobbyist for radioactive waste dumpers WCS, 
  and Texas Tech's Chancellor John Montford would be one of the senators who helped WCS's Ken Bigham get his 
first legislative effort through the Senate in 1995).]
  

 <BR><BR>
 
 When Governor Ann Richards signed legislation consenting to join the Maine-Vermont Compact in 1993, 
 the Sierra Blanca site was immediately designated as the host site.  
 The compact had been delayed due to public opposition, but now passed, co-sponsored by 22 members of the House
 with  Republicans Joe Barton and Tom DeLay leading a bi-partisan rally.
 By the time the US Congress was voting on enacting the compact in 1998,
 the opposition to the dump had been able to enlist the help of some sympathetic members of congress, such as 
 Paul Wellstone (D-MN).  Wellstone protested the compact strongly, raising the environmental issues,
 but also stressing the irony of the vast economic differences between the average incomes of the residents of 
 Sierra Blanca, and those of the state of Maine.
 
 <BR><BR>
The Sierra Blanca dump had gathered the most attention than any other disposal effort so far.
Over the years, opposition grew from across the state, and after the Compact had passed, across the nation.

Twenty US and Mexican governmental entities, environmental organizations and individuals 
participated in public hearings and legally 
challenged the draft operating license issued by the TNRCC in April 1996. 
 
In addition to the geological and socioeconomic considerations, building a waste disposal facility on the site
threatened to violate the 1983 U.S.-Mexico La Paz agreement to keep polluting facilities 100 km or more 
away from the border.  When the Mexican Congress openly began to reconsider NAFTA, Washington began to take notice. 
 
 <BR><BR>
There were many other key actions, including:
<BR>
- children (aged kindergarten to middleschool) from a neighboring community in Mexico 
 participated in blockading the international bridge at Del Rio-Ciudad Acuna in protest, and at a later date also
in protest at the Texas capitol in Austin.
<BR>
- Mexican officials camped out at the capitol in protest
<BR>
-  In early August 1998, 500 Mexicans and Texans participated in a 4-day, 76-mile march to Sierra Blanca from
El Paso- Ciudad Juarez
 <BR>
-  Bill Addington, a resident of Sierra Blanca who founded the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund, fasted for 56 days 
in protest of the dump.
 
 <BR><BR>
 
In October 1998,  after 2 years of meetings, the State Office of Administrative Hearings
(SOAH) had finished a contested case hearing on the license
application. SOAH judges recommended denying the
license saying, "based on the [TLLRWDA's] failure to adequately
 characterize the fault beneath the site, and failure to adequately address potential negative 
 socioeconomic impacts from the proposed facility"  
 A decision was then left to the TNRCC commissioners.  At the scheduled meeting two months later,
several hundred people camped outside in the TNRCC parking lot including Mexican congressmen and 
other officials, activists from Mexico and across Texas.  Entertainers and the press corp joined them in 
the large gathering which continued throughout the night after the decision.
The TNRCC commissioners capitulated and cancelled the license application.   

<BR><BR>

After spending over $12 million in 18 years, the TLLRWDA still did not have their radioactive waste dump
and only reaped public opposition.  The Sierra Blanca site would be their last attempt, as the TLLRWDA would 
be dissolved and incorporated into the TNRCC during the 76th legislature.  WCS and 
Envirocare had been battling it out in the background for some time to license a private dump for themselves,
 and Texas still did not have a disposal facility for the radioactive waste compact, and the 
 competing obstacle of the TLLRWDA was now out of the picture.
 <BR><BR>
Maine and Vermont kept their $25 million, the box remained in Hudspeth County, and Texans won
a bit of time and postponed the Compact dump for a little while longer.  
However, WCS found ways to start dumping some
DOE waste through an exemption loophole, and future legislatures would consider the ramifications 
of either contracting a private company under a state-held license or allowing 
a private company to hold the license, which both risk opening the state to massive amounts of DOE waste.
The question for many waste dump supporting lawmakers at this point was either "will the compact dump be placed in Ward County 
or Andrews County?"  Regardless of where in Texas a dump would be placed, Texas law dictates that a company 
can evade reponsibility for the waste by filing bankruptsy and transferring title/ ownership to the 
State of Texas [Health and Safety Code, &sect;401.205(3)].

<BR><BR>
 


<b>Concurrent Texas Waste Wars</B><BR>
As the battle over the Sierra Blanca dump was being won in the late 1990s, two waste management companies were 
battling it out, competing to become blessed with a license for a Texas dump.  
It got so bad that supporters of the Texas Compact were afraid that the 
activity would jeopardize the Sierra Blanca dump.  It was even then suggested in WCS-backed legislative amendments
that the compact dump be moved to Andrews.  Since the defeat of the Sierra Blanca dump, this idea has remained 
a part of WCS's legal push.
<BR><BR>

Envirocare, which is licensed in 
Utah for a major national waste dump, was attempting to place a dump on its land near Barstow in Ward County, and 
was not preparing to surrender to a potential new competitor. 

October of 1996, a major bribery dispute occured when the former Director of the Utah Bureau of Radiation Control
Larry Anderson sued Envirocare's owner, Khosrow Semnani, complaining that he had stopped paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
"consulting fees" for work done while he was still Director of the Bureau.  Semnani countersued
accusing the ex-regulator of extortion.  It was found that Semnani had already given Anderson
$600,000 in cash, gold coins, and real estate.  The case obviously didn't help Envirocare much, and the company's 
opponents took full advantage of the situation, with allegations that they had "bought" their license.
 Semnani was
fined $100,000, and Anderson was charged for mail fraud, tax fraud, and
extortion.  
The DOE demanded that the owner step down, and kept Envirocare as a client.
Envirocare had also contributed over $90,000 to Utah legislators in the previous election cycle,
including $50,000 to Governor Leavitt's campaign.


<BR><BR>
Later on, Envirocare left Texas as part of an agreement, not only under pressure of the company
 rivalry, but also the public opposition to their dump in related counties.  This relieved tensions in 
 not only Ward but also Loving County, where Envirocare owned land targeted as a potential dump. 
This relief proved to be only temporary, as much of this land was later sold to WCS.

<BR><BR>

The second company, Waste Control Specialists (aka WCS, then run out of Pasadena by Ken Bigham), had land in 
Andrews County upon for which it had held a hazardous waste dump license since 1994, and by this time already had quite a 
reputation around the State Capitol for aggressive lobbying and several incidents of alleged "improper and unethical" 
conduct.  

  In 1995, WCS lobbyists unsuccessfully attempted to convert an outspoken republican  critic of their bill
with a promise of $60,000 in campaign contributions, which backfired.  


<!--Begin part sent to WCS page  Summarize this: -->

Later that year in November,
 50% of WCS was bought by Dallas-based Valhi Inc., run by billionaire Harold Simmons, 
who is a personal friend of George W. Bush and major contributor to his campaigns.  Simmons had a reputation for
funnelling massive campaign contributions to state and federal candidates, and had an team of 
high paid Washington lobbyists to orchestrate these Congressional allies when elected.
<BR><BR>


The lobbying team for WCS has been made up almost exclusively of ex-state officials and congressmen.
Leading up the team was Kent Hance, former Railroad Commissioner, who represented Andrews County when he was a
Congressman in the 1980s.  Hance was a WCS major stockholder and Chairman with an option to buy 25% of the company.  Carl Parker is
 a former state senator (D-Port Arthur); Chet Brooks, a former state senator; Cliff Johnson, former state
 representative from Palestine who served as commissioner of the Texas Water Board; Jim Rudd, 
 former state rep from Brownfield; Daryl Owen, former top aide to the senate energy committee.


<BR><BR>
 At a
legislative agenda meeting of El Paso city, county, and state officials held December 1996, a
resolution opposing the Sierra Blanca site was unanimously approved. According to those present, only
one official wanted to request specifically that the compact dump be moved to Andrews County: El Paso state
representative Pat Haggerty. Ethics Commission filings show that Haggerty received campaign donations
from Ken Bigham, and WCS lobbyists Chet Brooks and Carl Parker - all on the same
day, and only a few weeks prior to the El Paso meeting. 
<BR><BR>


  By early 1997, WCS had submitted an application and soon afterward was granted a license
   to process and store, but not dispose radioactive
  waste at Andrews.  This and the 75th legislature occured in the midst of a 
  20-month lawsuit between WCS and the DOE.
  
The Dallas Morning News obtained court documents after
the dismissal of the WCS vs DOE lawsuit in 1998 which
revealed a number of things about WCS's character.  

In line with the Simmons-Valhi reputation, WCS had been hiring well-connected lobbyists in Washington, for example,
former top Senate Energy Committee aide Daryl Owen had been lobbying for WCS since October 1995, and 
was promised a huge $18.4 million award if successful.  By this time, Simmons, Bigham and others connected to WCS had
 already donated over $90,000 to key senators and House members.  
 <BR><BR>


Also revealed was that Kent Hance had asked three senators who had recieved large WCS contributions
to block the nomination of Mary Anne Sullivan for DOE General Counsel, which succeeded
 [the three were Shelby (R-Alaska), Hutchison (R-Texas) and Gramm (R-Texas)]. 
WCS was even getting its congressional allies to assist in things like letterwriting campaigns.
One targeted at Energy Secretary Federico Pena asked him why his department was still doing business with Envirocare,
and urging him to reconsider WCS proposals during the WCS vs DOE lawsuit.  Gramm, Hutchison, and Shelby were among the 
letterwriters, which included one letter signed by 18 of the 30 Texas House members, nine of whom had received 
donations from top WCS supporters.
<BR><BR>

Wright Andrews, past president of the American League of Lobbyists, said WCS's lobbying has been hard-edged, 
even for Washington.
"It sounds as thought this has been an exceptionally aggressive and very political lobbying effort."  He continued
that he had lobbied Congress on nuclear waste issues before, "but it sounds like it is high-stakes"


<!--End part sent to WCS page.  End of material to summarize-->


<BR><BR>
In February 1997, WCS influence was clear at a hearing of the House
Appropriations Committee, as Reps Pat Haggerty and Talmadge Heflin, supported by Sierra
Blanca Representative Pete Gallego, went after the TLLRWDA's funding. The agency's director, Rick Jacobi 
was overwhelmed by questions about the agency's
bloated budget and questionable past expenditures, the Authority faced a weary committee grown
unanimously impatient with the issue. 

"They've expended a tremendous amount of time and resources,"
said committee chair Rob Junell (who also received a $1,000 contribution from Simmons the previous year), "and
they don't have much to show for it." Haggerty calculated that the agency had already spent $12
million on legal fees for only nine days' worth of actual hearings. The committee voted unanimously to
defund the Authority.

<BR><BR>
It wasn't until the next legislative session, however, that the TLLRWDA was dissolved in 1999 by HB 2954.
The bill was originally submitted by Gray, and was later hijacked by Buster Brown in the closing days of the 
Session when the other major bills relating to radioactive materials had died.  Rather than simply 
abolish the Authority as the bill prescribed, other legislators added an amendment to transfer
it's functions to the TNRCC.  Two other major bills during the 76th session were submitted by Representative
Chisum.  HB 1910, as released from the House Environmental Regulation Committee, would have authorized a facility to bury
the waste underground or store it in above-ground containers with the intent of long-term management or disposal,
and it would have prohibited issuing the license to a private entity. However, the prohibition against licensing a
private entity was removed during House floor debate, and the bill died in the Senate Natural Resources Committee.
HB 1171 as amended by the Senate, would have allowed TNRCC to issue a disposal license to a private
entity, but the bill died late in the session when the House did not consider the Senate amendments. 

<BR><BR>

During this legislative session, HB 1171 had been amended to introduce a
new concept known as assured isolation.  As discussed in the section on 
assured isolation, this concept was (and still is) poorly outlined and not 
specifically defined by federal bodies.  There is no federal law which outlines the concept, and since Texas 
is required to model its laws regulating radioactive materials on the federal laws
and NRC practices, this legislation arguably attempts to overstep the federal lead.
<BR><BR>

The cornerstone of assured isolation is the idea that the facility will be a storage site for waste 
for 300-500 years.  When this time is up, the decision will be made as to whether the site 
should be decommissioned and cleaned up (sending the waste to another place for dumping), or to just convert the place 
into a waste dump itself.  This postponement of whether to call the site a disposal facility or not 
was openly designed by the original authors to keep critics from calling the place a radioactive waste dump.
In addition, cameras and giger counters are to be used to make up a rudamentary monitoring system labeled 
"enhanced monitoring."  The presence of this monitoring has been used in just about every version of assured 
isolation to justify weak siting criteria, a lack of external monitoring, and even dismissing the standard 
environmental reports.  

<BR><BR>
At the request of two state agencies (the Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service and the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority), the DOE's Low-Level Waste Management Program
has produced a few evaluations of the concept, yet has not developed a formal definition of assured isolation,
and merely offered some additional descriptions, which provide the bulk of all federal reports on the issue.
The DOE says that an Environmental Assessment is unnecessary and inappropriate, and has not conducted a study to
produce an Environmental Impact Statement, which is normally required before such waste management methods are 
implemented.

<BR><BR>
These initial Texas attempts to legally define assured isolation were extremely primitive, and implemented a 
nonfunctional definition that the DOE had used, that "'assured isolation' means an integrated
management system for isolating low-level radioactive waste through
robust, accessible facilities, planned preventative maintenance,
and sureties adequate to address contingencies or implement future
management alternatives."  Usage of the word "robust" in this manner can be traced back to the 1995 debut of the assured isolation concept, 
where the author states that the facility "will have many robust features, such as concrete building and overpacks."
Obviously, robust is a bit of an overstatement for a simple concrete structure.

<BR><BR>
Assured isolation has been reintroduced in slightly modified forms in every legislative session since.
More attention has been given to the financial needs of the idea, such as separate accounts for both options of
conversion and decommissioning.  Some variations on environmental criteria and monitoring have been made, but 
one thing remains glaringly obvious: the presence of extensive discussion of how to convert the site into a dump,
 but absolutely nothing outlining the implementation of the decommissioning option.

<BR><BR>

Since WCS had been granted a radioactive materials processing and storage license from the 
Texas Bureau of Radiation Control, it had been pushing its way as close to disposing
without a disposal license as it could.  Early on, it focused on accepting materials for disposal
which the NRC exempted from being considered legally radioactive.  This exempted material could be waste
 that had been diluted down, or was already at levels of radioactivity that would be considered "below 
regulatory concern." In this manner, WCS could sell their hazardous waste dump area as a de facto "low-level" waste 
disposal unit, and as a cheaper alternative to bona fide facilities appropriately licensed for radioactive waste disposal.
In addition to this, WCS has been asking for amendments to its processing and storage license at a rate of 8 to 12
attempts per year, one  in particular attempting to exempt americium-241 waste, which is by rule not to be 
exempted.  Pushing the envelope of their license by asking for these add-on amendments
has been assigned a slang term: "license creep."
<BR><BR>
 During the DOE vs WCS lawsuit, Attorney General Dan Morales made the statement that WCS was dictating regulatory 
 policy to the agencies responsible for oversight and regulation.  This just so happens to not be isolated 
 to the DOE.  It is not only apparent in the documents WCS submits as proposals to the Bureau of Radiation Control,
 but by the company's behaviour in meetings with the Bureau.  Throughout the submitted written
 proposals is a clear tone of a demanding presumption of will, and not one of respectfully requesting
  for the Bureau's permission. 

<BR><BR>

During the 77th Legislature, Sen. Robert Duncan produced SB 1541, and Representative Chisum produced the
House equivalent, HB 3420.   This bill would
have allowed TNRCC to issue a license to a private entity
for a radioactive waste disposal or above-ground isolation
facility. The Senate Natural Resources Committee’s
substitute version would have authorized the license
holder explicitly to dispose of noncompact DOE waste.  This committee substitute version amounted to a highjacking of Sen. Duncan's
bill by Sen. Bivins, the familiar champion of private disposal for WCS.
SB 1541 passed the Senate and, as substituted by the House
Environmental Regulation Committee, would have
tightened restrictions on the license holder’s acceptance
of federal waste.  The bill died in the closing hours of the House
Calendars Committee.  Right in the middle of the session, Sen Buster Brown was caught 
with his hands in the waste disposal cookie jar when receiving a $10,000
"gift" from WCS's Harold Simmons.

<BR><BR>

"The DOE has identified this case for what it really is, an effort to dictate waste management policy to 
the agency (and the nation) that, not coincidentally, would offer WCS a way to evade Texas state law
and serve the firm's economic interests."  Texas Attorney General Dan Morales, Brief for Amicus Curiae 
State of Texas, March 1998.


  

<BR><BR>

  <B>The DOE v.s WCS Lawsuit (Sept 1996-May 1998) : Bypassing State Law</B><BR>
  Envirocare's Utah site is the nation's only state-licensed
private low-level waste dump, and has been the source of much aggressive
rivalry with WCS.   During a lawsuit with the DOE, WCS claimed that Envirocare had 
monopoly status on dumping DOE waste, and that WCS should also be able to open a DOE dump in Texas and reap the 
promised billions in profits.   Before WCS  delivered its proposal to the DOE or the TNRCC in the case, Envirocare
 Chief Executive Khosrow Semnani 
  bought up 880 acres near the WCS site and notified the TNRCC of an intent to license a federal DOE dump
  which served as a pre-emptive strike against WCS, forcing a TNRCC
  policy decision before WCS could act. 
<BR><BR>
 Since WCS was unable to change Texas law in 1995 to allow a private company a 
license for a dump, they prepared a method to bypass state law.
In September 1996, WCS submitted a bid in response to a DOE open call for proposals to take waste from it's plant in 
Fernald, Ohio.  Part of the deal was that the company must take title to the waste, and be able to get the proper 
disposal permits.  The DOE did not see WCS as qualifying, and just about the same time on 
October 18, TNRCC denied Envirocare's request for a license, 
saying it didnt have the legal authority to grant such a permit under state law.  
TNRCC executive director Dan Pearson sent a letter to WCS saying the same thing, and
emphasized that as a matter of policy the agency was opposed to "any scenario or arrangement" that 
involved state oversight of a private disposal
  facility. 
<BR><BR>
In a second letter, Pearson suggested that a federally regulated DOE site was a legal feasibility,
and if such a proposal were formally made it would merely require a policy decision by the TNRCC's three
commissioners, who were all Bush appointees.  
WCS's response was to submit another proposal to the DOE which outlined how they could operate a dump legally
 under DOE contract without obtaining a state or NRC license.  This also involved a research 
 partnership with Texas Tech University.
 They had hoped that if the DOE opened a site 
 with them at Andrews, that this would 
exclude the State of Texas from having any say in the process, for they claimed that as a DOE contracted site, 
they should be exempted from State regulation. 
 Citing internal policy, the DOE said they couldn't do it, so WCS filed a complaint saying its proposal could be lawfully
  implemented and that DOE unfairly rejected the proposal.  DOE responded that they did see what WCS proposed
  as being lawful, but that alternative regulatory agreements such as suggested were not covered under a poilicy decicion.  
  <BR><BR>

On October 3, 1997, Judge Joe Kendall of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Wichita Falls 
Division, heard WCS' case against DOE, and issued a preliminary injunction against DOE.
He determines that a state and/or NRC permit is not necessary for DOE radioactive waste disposal at a
privately-owned site under contract with DOE. The injunction barred DOE from awarding contracts for the disposal of
low-level and/or mixed radioactive wastes without considering bids from WCS.

  <BR><BR>
  
 By February 1998 the lawsuit sped up when it came to the attention of the National Governors' Association, who weren't too pleased 
 that the DOE considered the WCS proposal as legal (since it infringed on state rights).  WCS started asking for injunctive reliefs such as:
preventing the DOE from using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contracts to ship their low-level wastes to
 Envirocare's private dump in Utah; and, keeping the DOE from shipping low-level wastes to states unless an agreement
  existed with a particular state.  Two days later, sixteen states responded very concerned, with an amicus brief
  of a full statement condemning WCS's arguments.  
  
  <BR><BR>
  Among other things they said, 
"if a privately owned and operated facility that seeks to profit from disposing 
radioactive waste generated by DOE is exempt from external regulation, public health
 and the environment may be severely compromised. Radiation protection regulations 
 must not be rendered ineffective merely because a private facility agrees to dispose
  DOE waste."  They continued that "the WCS proposal cannot be implemented under the Atomic Energy Act. 
  WCS is not exempt from State regulation simply because it disposes DOE waste at its privately owned and 
  operated facility. Further, disposal of DOE waste at the WCS facility in the absence of State regulation
   is inconsistent with the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985."
    <BR><BR>

U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the preliminary injunctions placed upon the
DOE and dismissed the case in May 1998.  However, the court not only denied entering the amicus brief the states had filed
 but also found that the district court was correct 
in determining that a state or NRC license is not required for a private site to dispose of 
low-level or mixed radioactive waste from the DOE, but that the DOE has the discretion to require a state or 
NRC license before granting a contract.
