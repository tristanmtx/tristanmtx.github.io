July 20, 2005- 	TCEQ issued WCS a 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/assets/public/permitting/waste/rad/wcs/courtesyletter.pdf">courtesy letter</A> with 
early notification of issues that are of fundamental importance to the consideration of the WCS application.


<BR>
<HR>




<BR>
In 2003, the Texas State Legislature considered a bill which it 
had been presented with in several different forms for many years,
and finally signed it into law.
Just like previous versions, that session's version of the bill 
(known as House Bill 1567 aka HB1567) was largely written by
a group of extremely highly paid lobbyists for the waste disposal 
industry, specifically a company in Andrews County called <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">Waste Control 
Specialists LLC (WCS)</A>.  The company had accomplished this through years 
of pouring millions of dollars in campaign contributions and soft-money
contributions to state legislators.  
<BR><BR>

[Note: this issue has alot of prehistory associated with it.  See the sections on 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS in Texas</a>
and <a class="redlink" target="_blank" href="texaswaste.html" target="_blank">Waste Disposal in Texas</a> 
for detailed background.  Another important factor to waste disposal in Texas is an agreement known as
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">"The Texas Compact"</A>
 which states that Texas is to be responsible for taking radioactive waste from nuclear 
power plants in Maine and Vermont, and is outlined in 
<a class="redlink" target="_blank" href="texascompact.html" target="_blank">its  own section</a>.]

<BR><BR>

One of the things that the new law did was to allow companies in Texas to 
import nuclear waste which was not the responsibility of the State itself,
which was previously prevented
 (with the exception of waste from the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">Texas Compact</A>).
  It also went even further and outlined how
the designated company would import huge amounts of waste from nuclear 
weapons factories operated by the US Department of Energy.  This was 
unprecedented- previous bills had merely removed the prohibition on 
importation, while HB1567 specifically mandated a second waste dump 
for this federal nuclear waste.  The bill masqueraded as limiting the 
size of the dumps, with specified limits, yet merely accomodated liberal amounts of waste 
which experts had discussed as what could be feasibly imported at the 
site over the specified time period anyway.

<BR><BR>

The new law presented a regulatory timeline, which along with its other 
contents, was inserted into the regulatory body's rulebook later in the year.
During this rulemaking process, dissent had limited scope, since this agency
was operating under legal mandate, from which it had no choice.  The agency 
delegated to regulate waste disposal in Texas is the Texas Commission on 
Environmental Quality, (the TCEQ, Texas EPA, previously TNRCC).
In written comments for this rulemaking, <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</A> complained that HB1567 didn't go far enough,
and that limiting the amount of waste they could import was somehow unusually restrictive.
<BR><BR>

<span class="newstdtext12"><I>As it passed and was signed into law, this bill:</span></I>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>- Mandated that a private corporation will operate 2 nuclear dumps in Texas.</B>
This replaced a State prohibition on allowing a private company to become licensed for radioactive waste disposal.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>- Two dumps at one site:</B> One dump is for the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">Texas Compact</A> (commercial power plant waste), 
and an separate dump right next door for Federal waste (from nuclear weapons facilities).  
Both dumps are to open at the same time, and both share the same license.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>- Importation of 162 million cubic feet of nuclear weapons-related federal waste:</b> 3 million cubic yards for the first 5 years (81 million cubic feet), 
and then doubled to 6 million cubic yards (162 million cubic feet) of radioactive waste.
Federal waste amount equates to a football field 282 (281.74) stories tall* - 
60 times what the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">Texas Compact</A> was estimated to bring to Sierra Blanca over 35 years!
10% of federal waste can be Class B and C (see <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wastetypes.html">waste types overview</a> for definitions)</b>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [*Department of Energy, EM Progress, Fall/Winter 2002, pg 9.  Stated the Nevada Test site 
recieved 2.3 million cubic feet of waste the previous year, and said that amount "equates" 
to a football field 4 stories tall.]

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<B>- Miniscule Insurance Coverage: </B>
The company only has to give $20 million to Texas for liability coverage.  
Host County (presumably) gets 5% of gross reciepts for public spending, another 5% goes into a perpetual care fund.
In the bill's fiscal report, 5% of reciepts is projected as being $400,000 per year 
 (at $8 million yearly gross reciepts).  After 10 years, this amounts to $4 million, which would be placed into the State's
 Perpetual Care Account.  Added to the $20 million in financial security to cover the cost of leakage, etc., 
 This $24 million is a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars (if not several billion) which is 
 required to clean up leaking sites of this sort.</B>
   <BR>
<!-- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  -->
<!-- <B>- Violating Federal Law:</b> Maine and Vermont are required in this bill to make initial payments of half their sum for participation in  -->
<!-- the Compact by November 1, 2003.  This is not stated in the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">Texas Compact</A> -->
<!--  agreement, plus, there is no Compact Commission yet formed. -->
<!--  Maine has also left the  -->
<!--  <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="texascompact.html">Texas Compact</A> as of 2004 -->
<!--   and is no longer bound or obligated to participate in any way. -->

<B>Timetable</B>
<BR>
Due to the majority vote, this bill went into effect immediately after the session.
Here is the timetable according to the financial reports on this bill.  The company <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</A> is already openly planning to 
cut out portions of the application review to become licensed by 2005 by using thier infamous legislative influence and bullying tactics to eliminate the 
opportunity for a contested case hearing.  More on <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</A> later.
Thus far, these dates are only a week or two behind schedule.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Early 2004 -</B> Announce applications for disposal license to be filed within 180 days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Late 2004/ Early 2005 -</B> Applicant selected, review begins<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>2006 -</B> Completion of Technical Review of applicant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>2006 and 2007 -</B> Proceedings at the State Office of Administrative Hearings (contested case hearing)
<BR>
