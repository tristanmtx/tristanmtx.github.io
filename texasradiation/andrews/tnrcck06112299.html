<BR><BR>
Dear Ms. McBurney:
<BR><BR>
In reference to your January 8, 1999 letter to Mr. Minor Hibbs requesting confirmation on the
matter referenced above, this letter confirms that the transfer for disposal of electric arc
furnace dust (United States Environmental Protection Agency designation K061) contaminated
with 220 millicuries of incident-related cesium-137 (Cs-137) to Waste Control Specialists LLC
will not result in the permitted hazardous waste disposal facility (Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission Permit No. HW-50358) exceeding 1 curie of incident-related Cs-137.
<BR><BR>
If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact Mr. William McCabe of the
Underground Injection Control & Radioactive Waste Section at 512/239-2252, or mail code
MC131.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
