Friends,
</p><P>
Greetings from Texas!  I'm writing on behalf of the Sierra Blanca Legal
Defense Fund--a group fighting a low level radioactive waste dump planned
for an earth-quake ridden site 16 miles from the Rio Grande (US/Mexico
border), in the beautiful Chiahuahuan desert in a small Mexican American and
low income town called Sierra Blanca.  On Wednesday, September 2, the US
Senate will make a final vote to determine whether Sierra Blanca becomes the
nation's next low level 
radioactive waste dump.  They will be voting on the Texas-Maine-Vermont
Nuclear Waste Compact bill (S 270).  We need your help to stop the bill!
</p><P>
Please call your Senators before September 2, or even better, make a visit
to them while they are back in their home states on vacation until August
31.  Calls can be made to the Congressional Switchboard at 202-224-3121.
Ask them to vote NO to environmental racism and NO toS 270.
</p><P>
Although there are 13 compacts and individual states that are supposed to be
opening new dumps, popular opposition has stopped or stalled every one of
them, except Texas.  We have a huge opposition movement here, including
people from across Mexico (the Mexican Congress unanimously passed a
resolution against it and came to visit Gov. George Bush with 30,000
signatures against the 
dump from Mexico).  Our Senators (Gramm and Hutchison) are completely sold
out to the nuclear industry.  This is why we need your help at this crucial
moment.  We are only a month a way from the end of the Congressional
session.  Please help us make the bill controversial enough to either defeat
it or stall it until October 9,when the session ends.

After successfully fighting the Texas-Maine-Vermont compact bill for 3
years, dump opponents were disappointed when the US House of Representatives
voted 305 to 117 in favor the bill in July.  The bill  opens Texas to
becoming the nation's next radioactive waste dump for commercial nuclear
power plants by allowing not only Maine and Vermont, but ANY other state to
dump their dismantled power plants in Texas.  Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN)
was committed to using any and all procedural maneuvers possible, including
a filibuster, to stop the bill.  All procedural maneuvers are now used up.
Sen. Wellstone, along with many House members and communities across Texas
and Mexico, are outraged that an 8-member conference committee stripped the
bill of an amendment agreed upon by both the House and Senate that would
have limited the waste Texas will have to take to waste from only Maine and
Vermont. It is very unusual for a conference committee to strip off an
amendment agreed upon by both House and Senate.
</p><P>
Rep. Doggett was one of the main opponents of the bill in the House.
"...[A]nyone who has come to Texas has learned that one of the great
qualities of our entire state is something called Texas hospitality...But
that very good and rare quality is being taken just a little too far  when
it comes to this compact, because there are those in Texas who basically are
saying 'send us your radioactive garbage.'  
Unfortunately, at the top of the list is our Governor, George W. Bush," 
explained Rep. Doggett during the floor debate.  "I find interesting the
emphasis on the word 'low' when talking about radioactive waste.  Well, let
me tell my colleagues how low this waste is.  It is low enough to kill you.
It is low enough to kill people for thousands of years to come.  It is low
enough to kill anyone in the future that might exist on this planet that
would never remember those of us 
that are gathered on the floor of this Congress today."
</p><P>
Rep. Becerra, Chair of the Hispanic Caucus, stated during the floor debate,
"I think it's unfortunate that once again we're seeing communities that are
poor, often times unrepresented well because they are not sophisticated
politically and may not have the money to give to campaigns or whatever the
reason,  now again being dumped upon.  Let me read a letter sent yesterday
by LULAC: ' The decision Congress now faces on this matter cannot be made in
a vacuum, ignoring serious environmental justice questions that have been
raised about the site selection process.  These unjust procedures are in
contradiction of the 1994 Executive Order that firmly upheld environmental
justice.  LULAC would caution Congress not to be complicit in what has
become, intentionally or not, a repulsive trend in this county to place the
most hazardous and undesirable facilities in politically powerless
communities with high percentages of poor, 
communities of color.' "
</p><P>
Rep. Reyes said, " I do not believe we should be considering a conference
report that ignores the will of both the House and Senate. . . I think the
people of West Texas deserve better treatment by this House than they have
received on this issue.  If Texas state regulators don't support the Sierra
Blanca  site, why should we jeopardize the health and the well-being of
people in West Texas?"
</p><P>
The controversial bill, which was defeated by the House in 1995, and failed
to get enough votes to be brought to the floor in 1996, was voted on again
in 1997 after intense lobbying from Governor Bush and the nuclear industry.
The bill was amended in the House by Rep. Lloyd Doggett in 1997 and by Sen.
Wellstone in 1998.  The Doggett amendment, passed by 3/4 of the House and
the entire Senate, made approval of the tri-state agreement contingent upon
allowing only 
those three states to dump at the Texas site.  An additional amendment by
Wellstone and passed unanimously by the Senate clarified the legal rights of
local residents and business owners to challenge discrimination based on
color, national origin, race, or income level and gave residents the right
to sue to stop 
implementation of the compact.
</p><P>
"This bill would never have even been heard if it weren't for Gov. Bush
lobbying personally and through his office of State-Federal Relations," said
Bill Addington, Sierra Blanca resident and business owner.  "Rep. Doggett
called the Governor's bluff with his amendment and now it should be clear to
everyone that the three-state limit was nothing but sheep's clothing to get
this national dump shoved down our throats."
</p><P>
Although the compact bill, if passed, will trigger $55 million in funds from
Maine and Vermont to dig the dump, no construction can begin until the Texas
Legislature appropriates the construction budget.  The Texas Legislature
reconvenes in January, 1998.

 We at Ward Valley do not say, <I>"No nuclear waste in our backyard!"</i>  We say,
<I>"No nuclear waste in</i><B> ANYONE'S</b><I> backyard!"</i>  We call upon all of you out there to write or call (since time is of the essence, preferably call!) your
Senator tell them to <B>vote NO on S270</b>.  Sierra Blanca is another one of those
big battles in the war against the nuclear destruction of this planet.
Please, give them a hand in their fight.  It is so very important!

<B><I>UPDATE:</i>
<BR> 
<font size=+2 color="#ff6600">SIERRA BLANCA LICENSE DENIED!!!</font></b>
</center>
 <P>
&#160; &#160; The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission DENIED the license
application for a nuclear power dump in SIERRA BLANCA TX today!!
<BR>
&#160; &#160; 
From the courtroom, Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund reps said "This is the
biggest victory for the TX MEX Border in history. This just might be a total
victory for Sierra Blanca. "
<BR>
&#160; &#160; 
The decision was unanimous- all three judges voted NO on the license.
An appeal of the decision can be made by the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority within the next 20 days.
<BR>
&#160; &#160; 
Concern now focusses on the Waste Control Specialists hazardous waste dump
and in Andrews County, TX which is attempting to expand to take radioactive
waste and the Envirocare proposed dump in Andrews county.
<BR>
&#160; &#160; 
THANKS to all who have been helping to stop the Sierra Blanca dump!!!
