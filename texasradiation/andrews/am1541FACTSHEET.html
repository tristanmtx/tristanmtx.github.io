CSSB 1541 </FONT><BR>

Dangerous Radioactive Waste Policy for Texas</b>
<BR><BR></center>
  <LI> CSSB 1541 was amended in the Senate Natural Resources Committee with a 16-page amendment that was unacceptable to the author.  
<bR><bR><LI> The amendment was tailor-made for Waste Control Specialists-a private company hoping to use Texas as a dumping ground so that the company may enrich itself from the federal nuclear weapons waste clean-up market.

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">CSSB 1541 As Amended:</FONT></B>
<bR>
  <LI>Allows waste to be dumped in earthen trenches without first being placed in concrete canisters or  other containment structures. 
<bR><bR>
  <LI>Allows a private company to open two radioactive waste dumps in Texas that both could accept unlimited amounts of low level and mixed radioactive waste. "Mixed" waste means radioactive waste that is mixed with hazardous chemicals. This waste is radioactive for up to millions of years.
<bR><bR>
  <LI>One dump would be for compact waste and the other would be for "federal facility waste."  2.7 million cubic feet of compact waste is estimated to be generated by Texas, Maine, and Vermont.  Hundreds of millions of cubic feet of mixed and low level radioactive waste from the US Department of Energy could be imported to Texas from over 70 US Department of Energy (DOE) contaminated weapons complexes are scattered across the country.

</CENTER>


The State of Texas (the taxpayers) would own the waste and the land at the compact site, and would be liable for accidents and clean-up in the future when the dump leaks.  Governor-appointed compact commissioners could vote to import unlimited amounts of waste from other states to be disposed of at the Texas compact facility.  There are 103 nuclear power plants in the U.S. nearing the ends of their licenses. No other state has opened a compact facility in the 20 years since the compact law was passed by the US Congress.

According to the bill, title to the DOE waste would be transferred to the federal government before the license is terminated, and the land would be transferred to the federal government after the license is terminated.  The DOE would accept liability for remediation of the site when it leaks.  <B>However, this is NOT a guarantee that the site will be cleaned up:</b>

  <LI><I><B>DOE Site in Texas Still Contaminated After 10 years</B></I>
In Texas, the DOE  was responsible for cleaning up the Susquehanna uranium mill tailings dump near Falls City.  According to the DOE, hazardous and radioactive materials leached into the aquifer below the Susquehanna site and migrated at least 2,500 feet from the tailings piles.  The DOE agreed to take responsibility for cleaning the aquifer and groundwater at the site, but balked at the price-tag: $384 million.  The DOE instead decided to allow the aquifer to "flush" itself clean, which will take at least a century.  The state accepted DOE's plan.  To this day, the aquifer is still contaminated.

  <li><I><B>Federal Government Cuts Funding for DOE Clean-Up Responsibilities</B></I>
<br>
According to the  <I>LA Times</I>, April 24, 2001, the Bush Administration has omitted any money from the federal budget to continue the clean-up of a huge uranium slag heap in Utah that has been leaking radioactive waste into the Colorado River-source of drinking water for 25 million people.  The uranium waste heap is a Department of Energy clean-up project. The waste was generated by a private company called Atlas Corp., which produced uranium for nuclear weapons.  Atlas went bankrupt in 1998. Cost estimates for removing the pile range from $300 million to $1 billion.  The Bush administration may decide that it is too expensive and not necessary to move the pile.

  <LI><I><B>DOE Lowers Clean-Up Standards in Order to Decrease the Cost of Clean-Up</B></I>

At Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory, the DOE changed their groundwater remediation requirement from 5 parts per billion for volatile organic compounds-the level it originally promised in a legally binding Recod of Decision-- to 25 parts per billion, because it was a quicker, cheaper "solution."  Instead of cleaning up the plume of contamination in the groundwater at the site, the DOE chose to "complete" its remediation by creating a "containment zone" within site boundaries.  The DOE guaranteed that groundwater beyond the site boundaries met federal limits for pollutants, but never cleaned the site.
<BR><BR>
At Rocky Flats, the DOE allowed residual contamination of up to 651 picocuries per gram of plutonium in the soil-about forty times the standard at other sites.

<font size= +1><B>The Texas Legislature Should NOT Pass CSSB 1541</b></font> 
<BR>
<font size= +1>At the very least, SB 1541 should be amended with the following: </font>
  <dd> - Require set volume caps to be placed on the compact facility
  <dd> - Prohibit below-ground disposal
  <dd> - Require a standard contested case hearing process on any radioactive waste management license
  <dd> - Require the state to hold the license and contract with a private company to operate the facility

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What Would Happen if No Legislation on Radioactive Waste Passes?</B></FONT>

  <LI>Texas generators will continue to ship waste to existing disposal sites, or store waste on site until it decays enough to be dumped in an ordinary landfill.  The disposal facility in Barnwell, South Carolina is scheduled to close in 2010.  The disposal facility in Utah is expected to accept all classes of low level radioactive waste for disposal in the near future.
<BR><BR>
  <LI>Approximately 45 entities in Texas generate waste on an annual basis, according to the Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Radiation Control. <sup>1</sup>
<BR><BR>
  <LI>Of these, only about a third generate more than 15 cubic feet annually.  15 cubic feet of waste would fit into a box with 2-foot sides.  Many hospitals and universities store small quantities of waste on site until it can be disposed of in an ordinary landfill.  All radioactive waste storage is regulated by the Texas Department of Health.
<BR><BR>
  <LI>The four largest radioactive waste generators-South Texas Nuclear Project, Comanche peak nuclear plant, Waste Control Specialist's waste processing facility (imported waste), and Rhodia Rare Earths Inc.-account for 97% of all the waste generated in Texas on an annual basis.  (36,503 ft3 out of 37,723 ft3)  These generators could continue to ship waste to an out-of-state facility.  The Sierra Club and others advocate for power plants waste to managed on-site at one or both of the power plants.
<BR><BR>
   <LI>The Maine Yankee nuclear power plant is almost finished decommissioning, and has shipped almost all of its dismantled power plant to the Envirocare site in Utah or the Chem Nuclear site in Barwell, South Carolina.
