Dear Mr. Ratliff:
<BR><BR>

This is in response to your March 29, 1996, letter in which you ask for
confirmation that a licensee, under U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
or Agreement State regulation, may receive radioactive and mixed waste from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

<BR><BR>

We confirm your conclusion that a commercial waste processing facility,
licensed either by NRC or an Agreement State, may receive waste from DOE
provided it is within the authorized scope and conditions of the facility
license. In addition, you may wish to contact the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority to determine what, if any, of the import restriction
authority the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act might apply to
this facility. Finally, there are Agreement State licensees in Tennessee that
conduct waste processing for DOE facilities located in that State. Tennessee
staff may be able to provide assistance on how they handle similar
applications. 

<BR><BR>

If you have any further questions on this matter, please contact Dr. Stephen N. Salomon, of my staff, at (301) 415-2368 or at his Internet
address: SNS@NRC.GOV.

Sincerely,
