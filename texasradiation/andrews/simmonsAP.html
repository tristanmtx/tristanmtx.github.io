<BR><BR>
DALLAS (AP) - Former corporate raider Harold C. Simmons is fighting for
control of his empire, only this takeover attempt isn't business. It's personal.
 

<BR><BR>
Simmons' estranged daughters are attempting to oust him as manager of
two family trusts worth about $1 billion, the bulk of his fortune. 

<BR><BR>
Two of his daughters, the eldest from each of his first two marriages,
claim in court filings that their father set up the family trusts to evade
taxes, creditors and his ex-wives. They also claim he is now using the money
illegally for political contributions. 

<BR><BR>
Simmons, 66, responded that the women are financially irresponsible and
&quot;are just looking for money.&quot; 

<BR><BR>
Before the trial began in October, he portrayed his eldest daughter,
Scheryle S. Patigian, to The New York Times as a methadone addict with all
the financial responsibility of a kindergartner. He said his third-oldest,
Andrea Swanson, had joined her older half-sister in the lawsuit because
she was being swayed by a husband who wanted to make questionable investments. 

<BR><BR>
But Simmons has already admitted in the civil trial, which began Oct.
23, that he forged his daughters' signatures to make political contributions
from the trusts to Jessie Helms, R-N.C.  

<BR><BR>
&quot;I thought it was right to sign the names because it would help
the Helms campaign. It was a mistake, wrong and bad judgement,&quot; he
testified.  

<BR><BR>
Simmons' political donations have been a cornerstone of the trial by
Ms. Swanson and Ms. Patigian, who say they do not support the conservative
Republican causes to which their father has given money in their names. 

<BR><BR>
Some of the recipients of the funds included Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch
of Utah, as well as Oliver North in his unsuccessful Senate race. 

<BR><BR>
Simmons has said that from 1991 to 1995 he made $110,000 in contributions
to political action committees in his daughters' names, exceeding the legal
limit. Federal election law limits an individual to $5,000 per year to any
group of affiliated political committees. 

<BR><BR>
Simmons denies any wrongdoing because the money is from the family trusts
and his daughters are beneficiaries. He contends that the contributions
benefit the companies owned by the trusts, which in turn benefit all four
of his daughters. 

<BR><BR>
Telephone messages requesting interviews with the four women were not
returned. 

<BR><BR>
Serena Connelly, one of the daughters who is not suing her father, objected
to the contributions in a letter filed with the court, writing: &quot;I
believe this practice to be highly unethical... I do not care what you do
with your money. I do care what you do with my name.&quot; 

<BR><BR>
Simmons has had previous run-ins over federal election law. 

<BR><BR>
In 1993, he was fined $19,800 by the Federal Election Commission for
breaking campaign donation limits. In June, The Dallas Morning News quoted
sources saying the U.S. Justice Department has opened a federal investigation
in Simmons' business dealing and campaign donations. 

<BR><BR>
The ongoing Dallas County Probate Court hearing will not decide guilt
or innocence about the campaign donations. Instead, the six-member jury
will decide whether the intent of the trust has been violated or if any
laws have been broken. If found to have mismanaged the fund, Simmons could
be removed as manager. 

<BR><BR>
That in itself could be a devastating blow. 

<BR><BR>
Simmons, who says he is worth only $30 million outside the trusts, claims
that if he loses the trial it would force him to liquidate his corporate
holdings of five public companies and at least 50 other corporations. Those
holdings include NL Industries, a producer of titanium dioxide, a major
ingredient in paint; Contran, a private company with timber interests; and
Dallas-based Valhi Inc., his main public holding company. 

<BR><BR>
Ms. Swanson and Ms. Patigian claim that Simmons has used Contran and
their trusts to purchase resort homes and a corporate jet for his own use,
buy more than $1.5 million in jewelry for his current wife and pay himself
$4.4 million a year.  

<BR><BR>
&quot;In essence, Simmons has used the trusts for his own personal enrichment
and as a vehicle to circumvent trust and federal election laws,&quot; Ms.
Patigian said in a court filing. 

<BR><BR>
Simmons disagreed on the stand, saying, &quot;I think there is a real
distinction when Contran pays something compared to when the trust pays
for something.&quot; 

<BR><BR>
Simmons, who has never minded being called a corporate raider, received
more news coverage for his unsuccessful attempt to take over Lockheed Corp.
in 1991 than for all of his deals that have gone through. 

<BR><BR>
A native of East Texas, he earned degrees in economics and didn't set
out on his own until he quit from a bank job because &quot;my bosses and
I disagreed on who was the smarter.&quot; 

<BR><BR>

Simmons began amassing his fortune in 1964 when he placed his early company,
University Pharmacy, into a trust. By 1973, he had about 100 stores which
he sold to the Eckerd chain for $50 million. 

<BR><BR>
Known around Dallas as being uncomfortable on the social circuit, Simmons
became prominent in the city when he donated $41 million to the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for a cancer research center.  

<BR><BR>
All hasn't been rosy. In the 1970s, he was acquitted of mail and securities
fraud charges and settled a civil suit for $500,000. He was found to have
violated pension fund management rules in 1983, even though he had increased
the value of the pension fund. 

<BR><BR>
The current trial could have been avoided. Mediation was ordered earlier
this year, but talks broke off. 

<BR><BR>
Ms. Swanson has defended her decision to take the stand against her father.
She testified that he needs to be accountable and that she had to stand
up for her and her children's interests.
