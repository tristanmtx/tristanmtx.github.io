    <h3><!--HEADLINE BETWEEN HERE-->Reeves County seeking legal advice on waste site battle<!--AND HERE--></h3>
    <p><em><!--BYLINE BETWEEN HERE--></em>By Greg Harman <em><!--AND HERE--><br>
    Odessa American</em></p>
    <p><!--STORY BETWEEN HERE-->PECOS &#151; Reeves County Commissioners may take their opposition to a proposed
    radioactive waste site into court.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commissioners Tuesday night allocated $20,000 of county money &quot;for
    legal research and expenditures&quot; to seek legal counsel and help develop a strategy to
    fight the construction of a low-level radioactive waste storage facility that may locate
    to neighboring Ward County.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We feel there&#146;s a legal issue regarding to the type of
    company and type of work Envirocare does,&quot; said David Castillo, county commissioner
    for Precinct 2.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rick Jacobi, vice president of operations for Envirocare of Texas,
    termed Reeves County Judge Jimmy Galindo&#146;s opposition to the radioactive waste site a
    knee-jerk reaction. Galindo asked commissioners to allocate the money for the fight.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;He was opposed to Sierra Blanca. He was involved in opposing a
    sludge disposal operation scheduled for Reeves County. I think he just kind of reacted
    without thinking,&quot; Jacobi said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Galindo, who requested the $20,000 in funds from the commissioners,
    bristled at the suggestion.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This issue is not about opposition. It is about environmental
    hazards. If you talk to ordinary people in West Texas, the overwhelming majority of them
    will respond the same way I do. We don&#146;t want West Texas to become a dumping ground.
    We don&#146;t want our home to become a dumping ground for the nation,&quot; Galindo said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expressing concern over the health risks the waste could pose and the
    track record of the company&#146;s Utah parent company, the Reeves County commissioners
    passed a resolution opposing the company locating to Ward County on Oct. 12.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We don&#146;t ill-wish our neighbors, but I don&#146;t think this
    is the kind of economic industry we want to ever get into,&quot; Castillo said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Castillo suggested that Reeves County commissioners would gladly work
    with Ward County commissioners to help develop a diversified economy in Ward County, if it
    means there won&#146;t be a dump.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though both counties have been subject to the economic turbulance of a
    downturned rural Texas economy, Reeves County has had some good fortune.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Ward County has struggled to attract industry to its area, Reeves
    County has had some success with its growing detention center, which doubled in size this
    year, licensed under the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waste facility proposed by Envirocare of Texas, sister company to
    Envirocare of Utah, would house civilian-generated low-level radioactive waste from Texas,
    Maine and Vermont in aboveground, concrete bunkers for an undetermined period of time
    &#151; most likely in Ward County. Most of the waste, in bulk and in radioactivity, would
    come from decommissionered nuclear power plants.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is expected to create a minimum of 75 jobs.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company also is considering locations in Loving and Borden
    counties.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If he could learn more about it, he could support the
    project,&quot; Jacobi said of Galindo. &quot;We&#146;ve talked at length. His inclination
    is just to be opposed to it.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company had planned to announce its site selection on Oct. 1, but
    has delayed that decision to further study results of test wells drilled north of Barstow
    in western Ward County.</p>
