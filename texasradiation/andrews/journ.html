<DD> - "Texas Rep. Gary Walker,
R-Plains, plans to submit a bill allowing the state to consider a dump in
Andrews.

<DD> "Opponents contend that hospital waste would account for only 35 percent of the
material dumped. The overwhelming majority of
low-level radioactive waste generated in the United States comes from
decommissioned nuclear power plants and other industrial
usage, they say."

<DD> "Walker complains that the dump opponents don't even live in Andrews.
"You won't find any serious local opposition," Walker said. "People here know
that it can be safe and it's good business."


<DD> Local opposition is pitted against local businesses... as one resident said
 in another article,
"many local residents oppose taking the waste but are afraid they will lose their

<DD> - UT study discloses presence of Ogallala aquifer in proposed nuclear waste site.
<DD> - March 17, 1999, Odessa American, by Greg Harman 
       
       
       <DD> - "A study released by the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology shows the
       geology of western Andrews County may be unsuitable for radioactive waste disposal.
       The report, released late last month and made public Tuesday, said the Ogallala aquifer is located
       beneath land owned by Envirocare of Texas and may also lie beneath Waste Control Specialists'
       hazardous and low-level radioactive storage facility.

       Concerned mainly with the possible location of underground water beneath the two sites, the report
       prepared by the bureau's research scientist, Alan Dutton, questions the methodology behind a recent
       report by Texas Tech University scientists, paid for by Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists.
<DD>
 "He states that Ogallala is absent at the WCS site," Dutton's report said. 
 "No scientific description or documentation were included with the text ... to substantiate these
       interpretations."
       
       <DD>
The report also states that "the description of core materials" at the WCS site
resemble those found at Envirocare's 888 acres, located eight miles southeast of
Envirocare's unimproved lands.   Wet core samples taken from the Envirocare of
Texas site reflect the presence of groundwater, the report said.  Core samples
taken from the WCS site for the company's 1993 application for radioactive waste
disposal also were wet. 
<DD>       
       "The Texas Low-Level Radioactive Disposal Authority, the state agency charged with siting and
     operating a low-level radioactive waste dump in Texas for wastes
     from Maine and Vermont, requested the report from the Bureau of Economic Geology in
     January.
