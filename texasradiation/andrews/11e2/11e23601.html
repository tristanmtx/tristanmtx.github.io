Dear Mr. Kania:
<BR><BR>
Agency staff have completed their review of your pre-operational monitoring plan and offer the
following comments:
<BR><BR>
<DD> - WCS refers to an "11e(2)/ LLRW" facility throughout their plan. At the present time,
TDH has no authority over the disposal of LLRW. WCS is advised to request information
on LLRW disposal from TNRCC. References to LLRW throughout document should be
removed;
<BR><BR>
<DD> - In Table 3.1, WCS lists "key" radionuclides for their monitoring program. Several of the

listed radionuclides would not be expected to be found in 11e(2) material. The licensee
should perhaps concentrate on the naturally occurring radionuclides which would be
expected in 11e(2) material. Does the licensee expect monitoring interference or masking
of byproduct radionuclide results from other disposal/ processing activities?
<BR><BR>


<DD> - Section 3.1. Performance assessments for waste facilities are done mostly for low-level

radioactive waste sites. The performance of byproduct disposal impoundments is judged
mostly on the basis of adequate site selection, design criteria, choice of building materials,
and groundwater protection;
<BR><BR>
<DD> - Section 3.2. Non-radiological constituents of byproduct wastes are governed by

&sect;289.260(c)(17);

<BR><BR>
<DD> - Section 3.2. It is not clear how one can establish baseline for a site which may be

impacted by the operation of a RCRA disposal facility. Baseline concentrations of
radiological and non-radiological materials may change because of ongoing impacts from
a RCRA facility and on the long term, such a facility might mask impacts from a byproduct
disposal facility;



<BR><BR>
<DD> - Figure 5.1. This figure does not clearly show the location and orientation of the possible

byproduct waste disposal facility. Thus, it is difficult to comment on the adequacy of
sample location placement;


<BR><BR>
<DD> - Regulatory Guide 4.14 (USNRC, 1980) should also be consulted for guidance on the

lower limit of detection for analytical programs;

<BR><BR>
<DD> - WCS's draft pre-operational program should delete and correct references to obsolete

Texas radiation control regulations; and

<BR><BR>
<DD> - TDH Regulatory Guide 1.1 (withdrawn) and TNRCC Regulatory Guide 147 (withdrawn)

provide a satisfactory outline for a pre-operational monitoring program. WCS's draft pre-
operational program does not seem to include all of the radionuclides included in these
documents. WCS should consult these regulatory guides and modify their pre-operational
program accordingly.
<BR><BR>
No response or further action on your part is required regarding this action. If you have any
question you may contact me at (512) 834-6688 ext. 2208.
