Dear Ms. McBurney:<BR>
<BR>
WCS is providing a pre-operational monitoring plan to support an application for a Byproduct Material
Disposal Facility. We request the TDH review of this plan and comment on any deficiencies it contains
that would impede our application for a Byproduct Material Disposal Facility License.
<BR><BR>
Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions or need additional information
please call me at 888/789-2783.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
