Andrews Atomic Waste dump facility is a huge private nuclear waste storage
facility in Andrews County, Texas which is already (since February 1999) 
taking low-level radioactive waste from the Department of Energy, The Department of Defense,
 and private industry.  Andrews is also approved to recieve mixed, transuranic and toxic wastes.

 The site consists of 8-story deep pits and it is projected that 300 of these huge
 pits is enough room to bury all  of the 109 commercial reactors currently online in the US.

     Not only is it above the Dockum and Ogallala aquifers (<a href="Minaquif.jpg">map</a>) and upstream
    on the Colorado River from the Gulf of Mexico (<a href="colorado.gif">map</a>), but the seismicity of
     the area indicates that there are tremor 
   epicenters nearby which occur due to the Mescalero fault in the buried precambrian layers
    (<a href="fig3seismic.gif">map</a>).  
    But for some geologists this fault simply does not exist on thier maps, 
    and geologic activity is claimed to be merely the response to oil drilling rigs, but the 
    epicenters are there, in either case, and too close to the Andrews WCS site.

The company that has developed and is in charge of the site is Waste Control
Specialists LLC (WCS). WCS is owned by Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, the second richest man in Texas.
  Harold
Simmons was the number one campaign fundraiser and second largest contributor to
the George W. Bush for governor campaign, and also funded Jeb Bush's Florida 
campaign for governor. Owner of Valhi Inc. (aka VHI; 
[<a href="http://www.hoovers.com/capsules/11576.html">Hoover's profile</a>]),
he also owns National Lead Industries
(NLI).  NLI is a major chemical company (as in Dow, DuPont, and Monsanto) under the Valhi umbrella and has 
dozens of toxic waste dumps across the USA.
Simmons is known as the 'king of superfund sites.'

"The group representing Waste Control Specialists, formerly based in Pasadena, Texas,
includes former top aides to Gov. George W. Bush and a bevy of influential
one-time state senators and representatives." - (<a href="lobby.html">quoted article</a>)
  WCS is not still run from Pasadena.  Harold Simmons achieved majority stockholder recently at 75%
removing the previous owner, and moving the central office to Andrews County
 - (<a href="pasadena.html">related article</a>).

Although it has already been recieving shipments of radioactive waste, this region in Andrews County
is unacceptable and was rejected by the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) site search 
 and the Texas Low Level
 Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority (TLLRWDA) back in 1987 (<a href="TLLRWD.html">see rejection</a>)
  for geological and hydrological reasons (<a href="Block12.html">site data</a>). 
  
[the TLLRWDA and the Texas Health Department Bureau of Radiation Control were dissolved and functions 
merged into the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC)]

"During the closing hours of the 1999 legislative session, Senator J.E. "Buster"
Brown was successful in abolishing the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Authority, effective Sept. 1, 1999. When Representative Warren Chisum stopped
further action on the low-level waste bill, Brown introduced an amendment in
conference committee that abolished the authority. The amended legislation
affected several state agencies. Brown refused to remove the amendment and the
bill was approved- with the amendment- by both houses.
<BR><BR>
Responsibility for low-level radioactive waste management now rests with the
Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, the organization that denied the
authority's license application for the Sierra Blanca (Hudspeth County) site for
a disposal facility." - (from <a href="LegisActupdate.html">Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Legislative Activity Update</A>)

    The case of environmental racism is also a factor as 45% of Andrews County are hispanic.  
    This is not only a reality of the Andrews case, 
    but also in the case of WIPP.  Eunice NM is a small town sortof 
    squished between these two sites on the map nearly 30 miles from each.  3000 people live
     in that small town and it is 40% hispanic.

    WIPP (Waste Isolation Pilot Project) in New Mexico is run by the Envirocare corporation,
     a rival to WCS.  WIPP is to receive waste that is 
    too "hot" for Andrews and is located near Carlsbad NM.  The first radioactive shipment arrived
     in Feb. 1999 with 10 train-car-loads of contaminated soil from the cleanup of an old leaky Oak 
     Ridge Tennessee production reactor.
    It is 2,150 ft deep in the salt beds, roughly 500 ft shy of half a mile underneath the surface 
    and is actually drilled through and placed underneath two aquifer features including the 
    Rustler (Briny) formation
