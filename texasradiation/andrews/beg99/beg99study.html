<B>Summary</B>
</CENTER>

<BR>

<DD>Technical issues for siting a low-level radioactive waste repository in
Andrews County, Texas, include ensuring that a considered site satisfies the
licensing requirements spelled out in State regulations (TRCR Part 45). Most
of Andrews County is underlain by the High Plains aquifer, which includes
the Ogallala Formation as well as older Cretaceous formations. The presence
of this aquifer should be expected to pose a great deal of questions from
regulators and the public for licensing a low-level radioactive waste
repository. Available maps do not unambiguously identify any area of
Andrews County where the High Plains aquifer is absent. Possible areas that
merit further evaluation include the WCS Site near the State line with New
Mexico and the south-central part of the county near the border with Ector
and Winkler Counties.

<BR><BR>


<DD>The High Plains aquifer material is thin at the WCS Site. Documents
submitted as part of a RCRA permit application in 1993 and comments by
WCS consultants indicate that saturated ground-water conditions do not
occur at the WCS Site. Additional scientific data would be needed to confirm
or refute this conclusion and address site-suitability requirements for
licensing. An additional WCS document presents a revised interpretation
that the High Plains aquifer material at the WCS Site does not include the
Ogallala Formation. The data forming the basis for this interpretation
remains to be presented and scientifically evaluated. The presence or absence of the Ogallala Formation within the High Plains aquifer material however,
appears to be more of a public perception issue than a technical issue related
to site performance.


<BR><BR>


<DD>Andrews County lies at the southern limit of the High Plains aquifer in
Texas, and the aquifer material tends to be thinner in Andrews County than
in areas to the north. At least one map suggests that both the Ogallala
Formation and Cretaceous rocks making up the High Plains aquifer are absent
along part of the border with Ector and Winkler Counties. If this is correct,
siting a repository there might avoid ground-water issues related to the High
Plains aquifer, although other siting or performance issues may be important.

<B>Introduction</B>
</CENTER>


<BR>


<DD>The Bureau of Economic Geology was asked in January 1999 to review
data on hydrogeology and issues related to ground water for siting a low-level
radioactive waste repository in Andrews County, Texas. Specific tasks
included consideration of the following:
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>(1)	the extent of the Ogallala Formation, which makes up part of the High
Plains aquifer,
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>(2) the depth to ground water and the saturated thickness of ground water
in the High Plains aquifer,
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>(3) the features affecting recharge and discharge of ground water.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>To carry out this review, Bureau scientists reviewed maps showing the
extent of the Ogallala Formation and technical reports relevant to
hydrogeology of Andrews County, and discussed information regarding the
WCS and Envirocare Sites with their technical consultants.


<BR>

Site-Suitability Requirements
</CENTER>
</B>

<BR>
<DD>State licensing requirements related to ground water can be
summarized in six site-suitability criteria. These criteria and an overview of
how they are generally met in Andrews County are presented in Table 1.
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>
<B>Extent of the Ogallala Formation</B>
</CENTER>

<BR>
<DD>Various maps show the extent of the Ogallala aquifer in Andrews
County (Eifler and others, 1976; Weeks and Gutentag, 1981; Knowles and
others, 1984; Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995). The maps vary considerably in
scale and accordingly in the accuracy with which local geology can be shown.
The maps indicate the presence of the Ogallala Formation or High Plains
aquifer across most of Andrews County with the exception of the
southwestern corner and part of the border with Ector and Winkler Counties.
The delineation of the Ogallala Formation or High Plains aquifer is
inconsistent between the maps. Quaternary windblown sand covers bedrock
in most of the county and obscures where the Ogallala Formation is present
or absent. In the southern half of the county the amount of data from shallow
borings and logged sections of oil wells is too sparse to increase the accuracy of
surface geologic mapping.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>
The Hobbs 1:250,000 sheet of the Geological Atlas of Texas (Eifler and
others, 1976) shows the Tertiary-age Ogallala Formation as cropping out at
ground surface along Monument Draw across northern Andrews County,
around Shafter and Whaten Lakes, at the headward reaches of Mustang Creek 
in eastern Andrews County, and along parts of the Texas-New Mexico state
line including the WCS Site. The map shows that the uppermost geologic
unit in most of Andrews County is windblown sand.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>

The small-scale map by Weeks and Gutentag (1981) undoubtedly
generalizes the distribution of the High Plains aquifer in Andrews County. It
shows the High Plains aquifer occurring in all but the southwestern corner of
Andrews County.
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>
Maps from the Texas Water Development Board (Knowles and others,
1984; Ashworth and others, 1991; Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995) show a small
strip along the border with Ector and Winlder Counties where the High
Plains aquifer is absent.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>WCS Site</B>


<BR>
<DD>Detailed site information is available from the 1993 RCRA permit
application for the WCS Site (AM Environmental, 1993). That document
identifies substrate at the WCS Site as Ogallala Formation on the basis of
geologic logs of borehole samples. Descriptions of core material resemble
descriptions of other rock samples from the Ogallala and Blackwater Draw
Formations.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Lehman (1996) presents a new interpretation that substrate at the WCS
Site is not Ogallala Formation, but Cretaceous materials of the Antlers
Formation or younger Cretaceous limestone beds or both. He states that
Ogallala is absent at the WCS Site. This finding is apparently based on
Lehman's observations from outcrop exposures in the area and in a WCS
excavation. No scientific description or documentation (logged sections,
drawings, or photographs of outcrops) were included with the text of Lehman
(1996) to substantiate these interpretations.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Lehman (1996) also emphasizes a distinction between the location of
Ogallala and Gatu&ntilde;a Formation materials. This distinction is not geologically significant, but creates an impression that the Ogallala ends northeast of the
WCS Site. The Ogallala was deposited contemporaneously with the
development of subsidence basins forming west of the Central Basin Platform
and along the present trend of the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico
(Gustavson and Finley, 1985). The Gatu&ntilde;a deposits are equivalent to the
Ogallala Formation.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Lehman (1996) implies that the Ogallala was not deposited at the WCS
Site, rather than being eroded since its deposition. He states that the "Red Bed
Ridge," a broad, northwest-oriented ridge on the buried, eroded surface of the
Triassic Dockum Group, locally controlled deposition of the Ogallala
Formation. Lehman (1996) considers the "Red Bed Ridge" to have been a
persistent feature in the geomorphic history of the region. There is, however,
little evidence for this interpretation. The "Red Bed Ridge" probably has been
progressively developed during the Cenozoic with movement along the
faults bounding the west side of the Central Basin Platform and dissolution of
more deeply buried Permian salt beds. The "Red Bed Ridge" probably had less
impact on Ogallala deposition than Lehman assumes.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Scientifically documenting that the Ogallala is absent at the WCS Site
requires multiple independent and qualified geologists to examine the data
and reach the same conclusion. This step has not yet been taken and the
Lehman (1996) interpretation should be considered an alternate hypothesis
until such consensus is made. Data to substantiate the interpretation would
include but not be limited to:

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Drawings, logged sections, and photographs of regional and on-site exposures showing the basis for the interpretation, including

primary and secondary sedimentary structures, vertical trends in
sediment texture, and characteristics of caliche beds.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Petrographic examination of rock samples to determine the

presence or absence of diagnostic framework grains (igneous and
metamorphic rock fragments, fossil material, and detrital
carbonate rock fragments.


<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Regional map of thickness of sand and gravel in the High Plains

aquifer around the vicinity of the WCS Site.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Integration of data from an in-progress core study by WCS with

data from outcrop exposures.

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Description of soil to-evaluate whether site soils are the same

vertisols typical of the Blackwater Draw Formation. If the
Blackwater Draw Formation is present, its relation to the
underlying material needs to be documented.
<BR>
<BR>
WCS has sponsored a geological investigation of the relationship
between Cretaceous and Ogallala materials located northeast of the WCS Site.
(Allen Messenger, personal communication, January 1999). One objective of
this work is to document the extent of each stratigraphic unit and the location
of their unconformable contact. The work is being done by drilling and
logging a number of core holes.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Envirocare Site</B>
<BR>

Additional detailed site information has been collected for the
Envirocare Site, which is located approximately 8 miles southeast of the WCS
Site. The Envirocare Site also lies along the "Red Bed Ridge," a subsurface
feature with a broad, northwest-oriented ridge on the buried eroded surface of the Triassic Dockum Group. Based on geological description of core samples
and outcrop exposures, the Envirocare Site is identified as being underlain by
the Blackwater Draw and Ogallala Formations (Bruce Darling, personal

communication, February 1999). The description of core materials from the
Envirocare Site resembles the description of core from the WCS Site
contained in the 1993 RCRA permit application.
<BR>

<B><CENTER>
Depth to Ground Water and Saturated Thickness
</CENTER>
</B>

<BR>

Regional maps (Knowles and others, 1984; Weeks and Gutentag, 1981)
show that in most places the saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer in
Andrews County is less than 100 ft and there are large areas with less than 20
ft. The saturated thickness is the height between the water table and the base
of the aquifer on the Dockum Group. The regional maps are limited in

amount of abundant local data to define where the saturated thickness might
be very small owing to a high elevation on the base of the aquifer or to a low
elevation of the water table.
<BR>
<BR>
The saturated thickness probably is small along the "Red Bed Ridge" in
western Andrews County. The RCRA application for the WCS Site (AM Environmental, 1993; Allen Messenger, personal communication, January

1999) indicates that saturated thickness locally is zero and that the High Plains
aquifer does not remain saturated across the "Red Bed Ridge." This situation

is depicted in the conceptual model shown in  figure 1a. Farther southeast
along the "Red Bed Ridge" the High Plains aquifer is more continuously

saturated (fig. 1b). For example, at the Envirocare Site, which is also near the
crest of the "Red Bed Ridge" southeast of the WCS Site, ground water is
reported to range in thickness from 0 to as much as 20 ft (Bruce Darling,
personal communication, February 1999).

<BR>
<BR>


The ridge dips to the southeast at about 9 ft/mile whereas the overlying
water table has an apparent dip in that direction of about 7.75 ft/mile
(Knowles and others, 1984, v.4). On average, therefore, the thickness of the
High Plains aquifer increases by 1.25 ft/mile to the southeast along the ridge.
Envirocare is reported to have at most about 20 ft of saturated section (Bruce
Darling, personal communication, February 1999), so one might expect the
High Plains aquifer above the ridge near the State line, for example, at the
WCS Site, to have no more than 10 ft of saturated section. It also is likely that
the elevation of the water table in the High Plains aquifer fluctuates through
time with differences in weather and recharge rate. A saturated section can
develop and build up across the "Red Bed Ridge" in a given area that
presently is unsaturated. So conditions reflected in figure 1a might at a later
time come to resemble those shown in figure 1b.

<BR>
<BR>

Additional data need to be collected and scientifically interpreted to
address the site-suitability requirements for licensing a low-level radioactive
waste repository (table 1). Questions that would have to be addressed include
but are not limited to:
<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - where the water table in the High Plains aquifer ends (figure 1a), for
example, in the vicinity of the WCS Site or at other possible locations
in Andrews County,

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - what the fluctuation in the elevation of the water table is in the High
Plains aqulfer at and around the WCS Site, and

<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - what are the hydrologic processes and their rates that control the
fluctuations in saturated thickness and elevation of the water table.

<BR>
<BR>
Questions remain about the data that formed the basis for concluding
that there is no ground water at the WCS Site. Data collection deserves special

care in order to evaluate ground-water conditions where the saturated
thickness of the High Plains aquifer might be less than 10 ft, and where well yield possibly is low.



<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - First, the 1993 RCRA application notes that core from most boreholes is

moist or wet. At other locations at the southern end of the High Plains
aquifer, including the Envirocare Site, presence of moist or wet core
can reflect saturated ground water conditions (Bruce Darling, personal
communication, February 1999).


<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Second, the test boreholes at the WCS Site were reportedly left open

overnight and no free water was found within the High Plains aquifer
section (Allen Messenger, personal communication, January 1999). It is
possible, however, that any shallow ground water drained down into
the boreholes, which had been drilled deep into the Triassic section. At
the Envirocare Site, it is reported to take many days for water levels to
recover in a borehole under such conditions (Bruce Darling, personal
communication, February 1999). Monitoring wells would have to be
completed within the High Plains aquifer material to provide a test for
the presence and fluctuation of saturated conditions.


<BR>
<BR>
<DD> - Third, no seepage into the surface excavation at the WCS Site was

reported and this has been taken for evidence that there is no ground
water at the site (Allen Messenger, personal communication, January
1999). Additional documentation would be necessary to use such
observation as a basis of fact, including an accurate visual record from
the first day of excavation onward, to document that water never was
entering the excavation from seeps in the wall at the contact above the
Triassic section. The High Plains aquifer material in western Andrews
County has a hydraulic conductivity of less than 34 ft/day and only a
thin saturated section Knowles and others, 1984). It is possible for an
excavation to quickly dewater the area around the cut, so that the free-water surface would retreat from the wall face and later discharge by
evaporation.

<BR>
<BR>
<B><CENTER>
Recharge and Discharge
</CENTER>
</B>

<BR>
The distribution of ground water is tied to the location and amount of
recharge. Recharge to the High Plains aquifer in Andrews County probably
occurs (a) across large upland areas where the land surface is underlain by
porous wind-blown sand and (b) in small focused areas where surface-water
runoff drains to playas, which are shallow closed depressions of the ground
surface. Saturated zones can be discontinuous where recharge rates from
playas are low ( fig. 2a) or more continuous where recharge rates are greater
( fig. 2b). For example, only a few wells or boreholes in the vicinity of the WCS
Site have been reported to find ground water, and these have been located
near a playa (Allen Messenger, personal communication, January 1999). This
would be consistent with the conceptual model shown in  figure 2a.
Additional documentation on recharge processes and rates, and their relation
to the continuity of the underlying saturated section, would be needed to
address the site-suitability requirements for licensing a low-level radioactive
waste repository (table 1).

<BR>
<BR>

Ground water in the High Plains aquifer mainly flows laterally under
the local gradient of the water table toward discharge locations. A regional
hydrologic divide lies along the western side of the "Red Bed Ridge." Ground
water west of the divide flows toward discharge sites in the Pecos River
valley. Ground water east of the divide flows generally eastward across
Andrews County. Average rate of ground-water flow in the High Plains

aquifer in Andrews County (<0.3 ft/day [<130 ft/yr]) is probably less than
average flow in the aquifer (~0.58 ft/day [~210 ft/yr]) because hydraulic
conductivity is less than the average (Knowles and others, 1984). Some
ground water is discharged to water wells and some ground water within 10
to 20 ft of ground surface probably is discharged by evapotranspiration. A
small amount of ground water also leaks downward from the High Plains
aquifer and is the source of old ground water at depth in the Dockum Group
(Dutton, 1995).
