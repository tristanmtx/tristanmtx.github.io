One of the most obvious features of the Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico (<a href="SHPFig1.gif">fig. 1</a>)
is the abundance of small, mostly seasonal lakes
commonly known as playas (fig 2). Almost all
surface water drainage in the region is captured by
the approximately 19,250 playas (Texas Department of Water Resources, 1980). Playas, therefore,
are especially important hydrologic features, and
they perform a multitude of often interlinked
environmental and economic roles. These include
providing aquatic habitat, supplying water for
range cattle, capturing tailwater from irrigated
cropland for reuse, and serving as disposal sites for
municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewater.

Yet another role of playas, often misunderstood
or overlooked (see app.), may be the most important of all: that playas function as the focal points
for recharce of surface waters to the underlying
Ogallala (High Plains) aquifer. Recent studies
utilizing stratigraphic evidence (Gustavson and
others, 1993) and chemical and isotopic methods
(Scanlon and others, 1993, 1994; Wood and
Sanford, 1995) have suggested that in the High
Plains, recharge of the Ogallala aquifer occurs
predominantly through the playas and negligible
recharge takes place in interplaya areas. As focal
points of recharge, playas take on a new significance because of their capture of most surface
water drainage and the consequent potential for introduction of contaminants to the Ogallala aquifer.
<BR><BR>

The first goal of this study, therefore, was to
evaluate the plausibility, from a hydrologic point
of view, that playas are the principal source of
recharge to the Ogallala aquifer on the Southern
High Plains. This theory was evaluated by utilizing
a numerical ground-water flow model of a part of
the aquifer underlying 11 Texas counties (<a href="SHPFig1.gif">fig. 1</a>
and fig. 2).
<BR><BR>

This playa-focused conceptualization of recharge is markedly different from that used in
previous numerical models of the Ogallala aquifer,
the region's principal water resource. Previous
studies, designed to evaluate long-term-use trends
and future availability on a broad regional scale,
conceptualized recharge as a spatially uniform
surface process. These studies used either a single
regional recharge rate or recharge rates that were
varied over very large geographic areas.
<BR><BR>


Although the spatially uniform recharge approach was well suited to these water resource
evaluations, it is not suitable for quantifying rates
and controls on the transport of surface-introduced
contaminants if recharge is highly focused. In
particular, because of the relatively small playas
(approximately 3 percent of total area), comparatively high recharge rates would have to occur
through the playas to achieve recharge volumes
similar to those of the spatially uniform approach.
Such highly concentrated recharge could, conceptually, result in highly localized heterogeneous
directions and rates of ground-water movement in
the Ogallala aquifer.
<BR><BR>
Therefore, the second goal of this study was to
use a particle-tracking program to evaluate
potential contaminant movement in the Ogallala
aquifer under the playa-focused recharge scenario.
As a case study, a smaller part of the Ogallala
aquifer and several playas at the U.S. Department
of Energy's Pantex Plant, near the center of the
study area, were simulated with the numerical
model to track potential contaminant movement
within the aquifer.

Regional investigations that include this study
area have also used the term High Plains aquifer
instead of Ogallala aquifer (Gutentag and others,
1984). The term High Plains aquifer was used in
those studies because stratigraphic units other than
the Ogallala Formation, such as the Cretaceous
Trinity, Fredericksburg, and Washita Groups and
the Triassic Dockum Group, locally contain significant volumes of ground water in hydrologic
continuity with the Ogallala aquifer (Knowles and
others, 1984; Luckey and others, 1986; Nativ and
Gutierrez, 1988).
