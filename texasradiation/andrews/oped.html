<font size="+2">Nuclear waste bill dumps on taxpayers</font><BR><BR>

Hold onto your wallets, Texas taxpayers. The Lone Star State is poised to
become home to the nation's largest nuclear waste dump if a bill steaming
through the Legislature is not stopped.
<BR><BR>
Senate Bill 1541 by Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, would allow a private
company to open a massive nuclear waste dump in West Texas. Through a
loophole in the bill, this private company could then import unlimited
amounts of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and Cold War-era
weapons sites across the country.
<BR><BR>
The bill allows private interests to make a profit but requires that the
state -- the taxpayers -- take liability for the waste. The state would
actually own the waste as soon as it arrives at the dump. This is
corporate
welfare at its worst.
<BR><BR>
The corporation most likely to benefit from the bill is called Waste
Control
Specialists Inc., which owns a site in Andrews County, directly above the
Ogallala Aquifer. WCS stands to earn huge profits by importing vast
quantities of contaminated material from more than 70 Department of Energy
nuclear weapons production sites and dumping it in pits over the aquifer.
Harold Simmons, the billionaire who controls WCS, has showered Texas
politicians with more than $400,000 in contributions since 1997.
<BR><BR>
Duncan says his bill limits a Texas dump to waste from Texas, Maine and
Vermont -- the states that signed an agreement in which Texas agreed to
open
a waste management facility for all three states' radioactive waste. But
the
fact that WCS lawyers see this bill as a Trojan horse is plain as the
stars
at night in Texas.
<BR><BR>
A 1999 U.S. Government Accounting Office report on radioactive waste dumps
said "Without authority to compete for DOE's business, according to (WCS)
officials, the company was not interested in becoming the host facility
for
waste generators in the Texas compact."
<BR><BR>
The bottom line is that WCS won't make the kind of big-time profits it
wants
by just handling Compact waste. The Texas Compact states are expected to
produce 2.7 million cubic feet of radioactive waste over the next 35
years.
The big money is in DOE waste, which is projected at roughly 100 million
cubic feet over the next 10 years. In addition, tens of millions of cubic
feet of more waste could be brought in from aging nuclear reactors across 
the
country.
<BR><BR>
When hundreds of millions of cubic feet of radioactive waste are involved,
the costs of cleaning it up when it leaks and repackaging it can be
staggering.
<BR><BR>
At hearings on the bill, we've heard engineering professors and medical
professionals tell us that we need a dump in Texas to handle radioactive
waste that is produced during academic research and medical treatments. In
reality, 99 percent of the low-level radioactive waste generated in Texas
is
produced at our two nuclear power plants.
<BR><BR>
Texas taxpayers need to understand that this bill opens a radioactive
Pandora's box. Every nuclear waste dump in America has leaked, and the
clean-up costs are astronomical. A 1998 DOE report on the subject
estimated
that for a radioactive waste dump handling just 1.5 million cubic feet of
waste, the expected cost of cleaning up the dump would be $370 million.
<BR><BR>
Before we take on that kind of hair-raising liability, it's time we
consider
some options. We can limit our liability -- and avoid becoming the
country's
nuclear waste dump -- by requiring that the state hold the license to any
radioactive waste facility.
<BR><BR>
By doing so we could limit the size of the dump and require that
management
of waste be done in above-ground containers, where the material could be
monitored for leaks and repackaged before radioactive waste seeps into an
aquifer or other water supply. Keeping private companies from getting the
license would also eliminate the corrosive political influence of
corporate
interests that want all of the profit and none of the liability.
<BR><BR>
The production of radioactive waste should be minimized and eventually
eliminated, but if Texas businesses are going to continue to generate
radioactive waste the state will need a place to manage it. The best place 
to
do that is at one of the state's two nuclear reactors, which are already
contaminated and which already store high-level waste on-site.
<BR><BR>
It would be incredibly foolish for us to take on all of the country's DOE
waste and the massive liability that would go with it. Texas taxpayers
need
to stand up against this bill before Waste Control Specialists and its 
allies
in the Legislature drop the bomb on us.
