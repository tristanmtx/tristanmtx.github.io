Re: Spill of K061 material onto the asphalt apron adjacent to the rail spur on
April 2, 1998.
<BR><BR>

On April 2, 1998 approximately 0.34 cubic yards of emissions control dust was
spilled onto the asphalt to the south of the rail spur.  The area in which the
spill occurred was a radioactive work area operating under the control of GPI, a
licensed radioactive waste handler.
<BR><BR>
Reports were made to the Texas Department of Health, The National Response Center
and the TNRCC.  These reports were not required but was thought it was best to
take conservative approach and report as a courtesy to the listed regulatory
agencies.
<BR><BR>
Though the spill exceeded the ten pound Reportable Quantity limit, it was
confined to a controlled work area and occurred in tbe presence of those
personnel who were qualified to perform the clean up.  The definition of a
Release provide in 40 CFR 302.3 (Reponsible Quantities, Definitions) excludes any
spillage that is confined to a work area. Additionally, the WCS permit (#50358)
section B.1 states that the railroad container unloading facility shall be
operated and managed to prevent the release of any hazardous waste beyond the
zone of engineering control this material was confined to the zone of engineering
control and was immediately cleaned up.
<BR><BR>
We have attached a report from GPI that provides details describing the incident
and clean up effort.  If there are any questions regarding this matter please
call me at 505-394-4300.

Subject: Spill of K061 dust at the Waste Control Spectalists, LLC (WCS) Facility
during project 98022.


 <BR><BR>

On April 2, 1998, a 20 yd<sup>3</sup> roll-off container was filled with K061
dust 
(contaminated with approximately 40 pCi/g Cs-137) transfered from rail cars
located at the south rail spur posted work area at the WCS facility. The
container was covered with plastic and the plastic duct taped onto the container.
 The bows and tarp lid for the container were secureded with belts, screw-bolted
brackets, and bungee cords as supplied with this type of container. The container
was  smeared and dose rated for release from the work area.   During transfer
onto a WCS roll-off container (at approximately 1315 hours), the load of K061
dust inside the container shifted and approximately ten cubic feet of material
spilled from under the back side of the lid onto the asphalt surface.
 <BR><BR>

GPI personel were in the work area and immediately responded.  The container was
made horizontal by the WCS truck driver to prevent further spillage and the K061
material was covered with plastic sheeting weighted with sand bags to control
dispasion.  The fact that the spill occured leeward to the wind break containment
and GPI's immediate response minimized dispersal of the material outside the
approximately 10'x10' area of the spill.  No spread of material into the air or
further onto the asphalt was visible.  GPI personnel contacted a nearby WCS
employee who contacted the project manager and the WCS facility Operations
Manager.
<BR><BR>

GPI personnel maintained control of the area while dry wiping the back of the
roll-off container, shoveling the material into two 55 gallon drums, and
vacuuming all surfaces The back 10 feet of the roll container was covered in
plastic sheeting and duct taped in place to prevent further release of material.
The K061 was removed from all surfaces and contained within approximately one and
one half hours after the occurence. The K061 residue on the asphalt was cleaned
by a combination of low pressure spray and vacuuming with a squeegee 
attachment into a HEPA filtered vacuum.
<BR><BR>

WCS contacted the National Spill Hotline, Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission, and the Texas Department of Health (Bureau of Radiation Control) at
approximately 1430 hours.
<BR><BR>
The area and roll-off container were smeared for radioactive material and all
results were not significant above background. Results from the air sample in the
work area during the time of the spill were not significant above background.
Dose rates in the area were 4-5 uR/h which is the normal background for the area.
GPI personnel wore tyvek protective clothing and gloves during the cleanup. No
external or suspected  dose to personnel has occurred as a result of this
incident. Neither GPI personnel in the area nor WCS personnel outside the area
appeared to risk intake of the K061 dust.  GPI personnel will have metals testing
and bioassay for radionuclides at the concluston of the project as scheduled
prior to start of work.
<BR><BR>
A heavy metal plate was screwed onto the back of the container through the tarp
lid to provide support during transfer in order to prevent further release of
material.  The container was transferred by WCS to a storage location without
further incident.
<BR><BR>
The incident was unexpected because of previous transportation evolutions with
four previous roll-off containers using the same roll-off transfer truck,
personnel, supplied lids and plastic sheeting underneath. The response of all GPI
and WCS personnel was appropriate and deserves recommendation for quality and
speed of response. Further events of this type will be avoided by securing the
back of the lid to the container by means in addition to those provided as
standard with the container.
