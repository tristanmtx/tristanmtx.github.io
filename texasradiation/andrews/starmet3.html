Dear Mr. Ratliff:
<BR><BR>
Starmet CMI requests approval from the State of Texas, Bureau of Radiation
Control to dispose of exempt source material at the Waste Control Specialists
facility in Andrews, Texas.
<BR><BR>
Starmet CMI is a uranium processing facility located in Barnwell, South Carolina.
The process converts uranium hexafluoride to uranium metal. The uranium is
licensed by the State of South Carolina, Department of Health and Environmental
Control (SCDHEC) as source material. The conversion of uranium results in the
generation of dried calcium fluoride that contains low concentrations of uranium
(100 to 200 pCi/gm). CMI has been discussing the acceptability of this material
along with surface contaminated steel and wood, also contaminated with
uranium, with WCS. The facility currently has an inventory of 1,544 55-gallon
drums of calcium fluoride waste and 138 B-25 boxes of shredded wood and
metal. Additional waste may be generated that will require disposal. The
uranium concentration of this material is below 0.05% by weight uranium.
<BR><BR>
A request for approval of waste acceptability was submitted to Ms. Alice Rogers,
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission by the State of South
Carolina (see attached correspondence). However, CMI was informed that the
regulatory authority for granting waste approval was your Department.
<BR><BR>
It is CMI's understanding that under State of Texas Law, Waste Control
Specialists can accept source material that meets the requirements for exempt
material as defined in 25 Texas Administration Code, Section 285.251 (c)(1).
SCDHEC has exempted the Starmet generated waste from the requirements of
disposal at the licensed disposal facility with the conditions stated in the attached
letter dated June 17, 1999 from Mr. Virgil Autry (SCDHEC) to Ms. Lynne Garner
(CMI). As stated in this correspondence, SCDHEC requires written approval
from your Department prior to shipment and disposal at the WCS facility.
<BR><BR>
CMI requests Department approval for disposal of the waste described above at the WCS facility. If you have any questions or require any further information,

I please contact me at 803-259-2321.
 <BR><BR>
 Sincerely,
 <BR><BR>
