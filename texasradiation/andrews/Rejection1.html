MEMORANDUM

<BR>
TO:	Ruben Alvarado, P.E.
<BR>
FROM:	Lawrence R. Jacobi, Jr., P.E<BR>
DATE:	July 29, 1987<BR>

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Andrews County Site<BR>
<BR>
Based on the attached report, I don't see any reason to continue our evaluation
of the proposed site area in Andrews County. Unless we can prove absolutely
that the Ogallala is not recharged from or discharged to the site area, we are
precluded by TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN., art 4590f-1, Sec. 6(a)(7)(B) from considering this area as a suitable site.
<BR><BR>
If the County Commissionerts Court, or the County Industrial Development Group
want to conduct further evaluations to answer the questions posed on page 3, we
should have our own geologist available to oversee the work. If they are not
willing to underwrite the work, then we should notify all interested parties
that we have no further interest in the site.<BR>
