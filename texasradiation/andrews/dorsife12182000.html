RE: Letter from Richard Ratliff, Chief, Bureau of Radiation Control, Texas
Department of Health to your office, dated November 30, 2000.
<BR><BR>
Dear Mr. Burnett:
<BR><BR>
Waste Control Specialists has received a copy of the subject letter and offers
the following comments regarding it contents.
<BR><BR>
WCS does not agree that the Waste Acceptance Procedures (WARP) for radioactive
material under our RCRA permit do not adequately address acceptance of non-NORM
material. We believe that use of this procedure for non-NORM exempt material is
conservative in that it will result in additional testing, specifically a radon
emanation test, which is not necessary for non-NORM material.
<BR><BR>
Based on recent concerns expressed by the Bureau of Radiation Control (BRC), WCS
has not been accepting surface contaminated equipment that is not rubblized and
that can not be sampled/analyzed as uniformly contaminated bulk waste. As
suggested in an August 18, 2000 letter from the BRC to WCS, we have been using
the BRC guidance document entitled, "Basic Guidance for Determining That Material
is Exempt from Regulation", for the review and approval for acceptance of exempt
material for disposal at WCS.
<BR><BR>
We also believe that the comparison of our waste acceptance procedures to that
used by the Texas Ecologists Robstown site is not appropriate. Compared to what
is currently in place at the WCS site, they do not have a detailed TNRCC approved
waste acceptance procedure under their RCRA permit, nor the qualified onsite
personnel and equipment to assure that the waste meets all appropriate criteria
before acceptance. They also do not have an onsite radiation protection program
that applies to acceptance and handling of all exempt material.
<BR><BR>
If you have any concerns or questions regarding this letter, you may contact me
at 717-540-5220.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
William P. Dornsife<BR>
Vice President-Nuclear Affairs
