Mr. Ruben Cortez,
<BR><BR>
According to DOE 435.1, we need to notify the host state when we ship
radioactive waste to a treatment or disposal facility. Los Alamos
<BR><BR>
National Laboratory, in conjunction with Sandia National Laboratory, is making a
joint shipment next week to Waste Control Specialists, in Andrews County, Texas.
The waste material is Mixed Low-level solids, NRC Class AU. The
total amount of material is approximately 10,200 pounds. Please let me know if
you require additional information on this shipment.
