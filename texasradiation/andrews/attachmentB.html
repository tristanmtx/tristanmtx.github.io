 <B><h3>WASTE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA</h3></b>

<H4>Section 1 - Purpose and Scope</h4></center>


These Radioactive Waste Acceptance Criteria establish the basis for acceptance of low-level and mixed radioactive waste materials at the Waste Control Specialists, LLC (WCS) Andrews Facility in Andrews County, Texas. The following types of radioactive waste may be accepted at the WCS facility for processing and interim storage, and, in some cases, disposal at exempt levels:
<BR><BR>

<B>Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)</b>
<BR>
Radioactive waste materiai not classified as high-level
waste, spent nuclear fuel, transuranic (TRU) waste, uranium mill tailings, or mixed waste. LLRW
can include byproduct, source, and special nuclear material, natural occurring and accelerator
produced radioactive material (NARM), or sealed sources.
<BR><BR>

<B>Mixed Waste (MW)</B>
<BR>
LLRW containing both radioactive and hazardous or toxic components as
defined by the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Non-AEA radioactive material mixed with RCRA
or TSCA waste can also be accepted at WCS.
<BR><BR>

<B>Natural Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM)</B>
<BR>
Radioactive material resulting from natural
sources that contain any nuclide that is radioactive in its natural physical state (i.e. not man-made)
This includes NORM which may have been technologically enhanced (the chemical properties or
physical state of natural sources of radiation have been altered or the potential exposure pathways to humans have been altered)

<BR><BR>

<B>Source material</B>
<BR>
Uranium or thorium or any combination thereof, in any physical or chemical
form: or ores that contain by weight 0.05% or more of uranium, thorium, or any combination
thereof.
<BR><BR>

<B>Special Nuclear Materials (SNM)</B> 
<BR>
Fissionable radioactive material in quantities not sufficient to
form a critical mass as defined in TRCR Part 11.2.
<BR><BR>

Non-radioactive hazardous waste (regulated under RCRA and TSCA) can also be accepted from
approved generators for processing, storage and disposal at the WCS Facility; however, the criteria and
procedures for acceptance of non radioactive hazardous waste is not within the scope of this document.

other authorized recipient.  All waste accepted for processing will be approved on a case by case
basis.

<BR><BR>
<center><h4>Section 4 - Waste Classification</h4></center>

All waste received for processing. storage, or disposal must be classified in accordance with the
requirements in TRCR Part 21 Appendix E. Waste containing PCB material and/or asbestos shall be
properly identified Hazardous waste components shall be classified according to criteria in 40 CFR
761.13 and 268.

<BR><BR>
<center><h4>Section 5 - Requirements for Characterization of Waste</h4></center>



All radioactive waste shipped to the WCS facility shall have its radioactivity content determined prior to 
shipment. The radionuclides present and the radioactivity levels shall be determined from nuclear assay,
direct measurement, process knowledge, or any other approved method. (See NRC Low-Level Waste

Licensing Branch Technical Position on Radioactive Waste Classification dated 5/83) This information is required to maintain WCS facility radioactive material inventory levels within Radioactive Material
License limits issued by the TDH, Bureau of Radiation Control and to insure it meets the TNRCC perrnit
requirements.
<BR><BR>
The concentration of a radionuclide may be determined by indirect methods such as use of scaling
factors, which relate the inferred concentration of one radionuclide to another that is measured, or
radionuclide material accountability, if there is reasonable assurance that the indirect methods can be
correlated with actual measurements. The concentration of a radionuclide may be averaged over the
volume of the waste, or weight of the waste if the units are expressed as picocurie (becquerel) per gram.
