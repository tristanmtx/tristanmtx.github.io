WIPP- Whats Wrong With Burying Waste In The Region?

<B>Hot Brine Moves Toward Hot Waste</B>
<BR>

The temperature within the repository may reach 300&deg;C. Water, in the form of
liquid and vapor is drawn <U>towards</U> the heat source in a salt repository, as
opposed to other geologic medium where water moves away from the heat source.
This hot brine solution is acidic and very corrosive. According to the EPA (p.
7), the canisters would be breached in a decade or less. Under these conditions,
only the geologic medium can be relied on to affect any significant retardation
for times longer than a decade. Surprisingly, no corrosion tests have yet been
undertaken of containers exposed for decades to salt solutions, at temperatures
up to 300&deg;C, (EPA, p. 20).

<B>Repository Will Weaken</B>
<BR>
The presence of brine and increased temperatures would undermine the structural
integrity of the salt repository. According to the USGS (p. 6), "Increased
temperatures in salt would further decrease mechanical strength of the salt-brine
mixture and would increase the creep rate of dry salt."
<BR><BR>
<B>Difficult To Retrieve Wastes</B>
<BR>
The movement of salt under increased temperatures means that it would be almost
impossible to keep the repository open for extended periods of time. According to
the EPA (p. 3), it is unlikely that spent fuel rods could be safely recovered
from a salt repository "more than a few tens of years after emplacement and
backfilling, for by then the salt would have completely sealed the openings."
Thus salt is not the medium if retrievability is desired.
<BR><BR>
<B>Hot Wastes Will Sink</B>
<BR>
 As the salt is heated and becomes more plastic, it is expected that the
canisters would begin to sink (USGS, P. 17). Simultaneously, the canisters will
corrode and leach. As the canisters move downward, the canisters would also move
laterally towards the center of the repository where the temperatures are greater
compared to the outer extent of the repository. As the canisters moved towards
each other, the center would become still hotter and the salt more plastic. As
the salt becomes more plastic, the structural integrity of the repository would
be further reduced. Most salt formations overlie permeable limestone formations.
The canisters could thereby move downward to the limestone formation and enter
the ground water movement.

<B>Salt Will Not Work</B>
<BR>
Salt should not be considered the preferred medium. Salt is extremely water
soluble, is highly corrosive, and does not hold the radionuclides effectively.
I~hen salt is heated, water is attracted to the heat sources, such as canisters
of radioactive waste. Water moving through the salt becomes brine. When
this brine reaches the radioactive waste materials, the glass or ceramic waste
forms will break down and the radioactive materials will leach out. It has only
recently been recognized that this leaching can occur in months, rather than
thousands of years, as had been previously assumed.

<B>Salt Is Corrosive</B>
<BR>

Two high level waste forms would be placed within a geologic repository, spent
fuel or the high level waste from reprocessing. If spent fuel is reprocessed, the
favored waste form would be glass. In the presence of steam, salt and acid, the 
glass would "deteriorate rather completely... in a matter of days." (NAS, p. 116)

<BR><BR>
<B>Transportation Is Risky </B>
<BR>
Transportation of radioactive wastes into the populous parts of the U.S. and
foreign countries maximizes the risk to the population. During transportation,
the wastes are closer to larger numbers of people and "risks of accidental
 dispersal of radioactive material are greater	than during either
processing or emplacement" (NAS, p. 30).
