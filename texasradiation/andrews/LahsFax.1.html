Dear Ms. Toungate:<BR>
<BR><BR>
My client is considering a preliminary offer from Waste Control Specialists (WCS) to transfer, treat, and dispose of incident-related material resulting from the inadvertent melting of a cesium-137 radioactive source at its steel production facility. To assist our review, I am requesting a copy of WCS's Texas radioactive materials license.
<BR><BR>
Please fax the information to (703) 524-3440, attn: Dr. Carlos Stern, or it can be sent to me at the indicated address. My telephone number is (301) 972-4096.  
<BR>
Thank you.

Sincerely,
