<p>Before REAVLEY, DeMOSS and PARKER, Circuit Judges.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:
</p>  
<p>Waste Control Specialists, L.L.C. (WCS) sued the Department of Energy (DOE)  for rejecting its proposal for a new facility for disposing of DOE's low-  level radioactive waste. After a one day hearing, the district judge  granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining DOE from refusing WCS's bid on  specific grounds. We reverse and order dismissal of the case.
</p>  
<p>I. Background
</p>  
<p>The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA)
<sup>
<a name="footref1">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote1">1
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> empowers the federal  government to regulate all activities involving radiological health and  safety of atomic energy and its byproducts. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste  Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (LLWPAA) amended the AEA to provide that the  federal government is &quot;responsible for the disposal of . . . low-level  radioactive waste owned or generated by the Department of  Energy.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref2">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote2">2
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> Low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) is defined in the  LLWPAA by what it is not: it is &quot;not high-level radioactive waste, spent  nuclear fuel, or byproduct material (as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of  this title).&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref3">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote3">3
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> LLRW generally consists of &quot;section 2014(e)(1)  byproduct material&quot;: &quot;any radioactive material (except special nuclear  material [i.e. plutonium or specified uranium isotopes]) yielded in or made  radioactive by exposure to the radiation incident to the process of  producing or utilizing special nuclear material.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref4">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote4">4
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>
</p>  
<p>DOE disposes of its LLRW under its &quot;Radioactive Waste Management Policy.&quot;  In accordance with that policy, the agency's LLRW &quot;shall be disposed of on  the site at which it is generated, if practical, or if on-site disposal  capability is not available, at another DOE disposal facility.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref5">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote5">5
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>  Disposal at a non-DOE facility requires an exemption from this policy.  Under the agency's current exemption policy, DOE may use a non-DOE disposal  facility if, among other things, the facility &quot;compl[ies] with applicable  Federal, State, and Local requirements, and ha[s] the necessary permits,  licenses, and approvals for the specific wastes involved.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref6">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote6">6
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>
</p>  
<p>The AEA authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue  licenses for LLRW disposal sites and to exempt certain activities from  licensing.
<sup>
<a name="footref7">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote7">7
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> An NRC regulation provides that &quot;any prime  contractor of the Department [of Energy] is exempt from the requirements  for a license set forth in [42 U.S.C. &sect; 2111] . . . to the extent that such  contractor . . . transfers, receives, acquires, owns, possess, or uses  byproduct material for: (a) [t]he performance of work for [DOE] at a United  States Government-owned or controlled site.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref8">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote8">8
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> 
</p>  
<p>The NRC may relinquish to states, by agreement, its authority to license  and regulate certain activities, including LLRW disposal  facilities.
<sup>
<a name="footref9">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote9">9
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> Among other things, the &quot;agreement state&quot; must  certify to the NRC that it &quot;has a program for the control of radiation  hazards adequate to protect the public health and safety,&quot; and that its  public health, safety and environment standards &quot;are equivalent, to the  extent practicable, or more stringent that,&quot; the NRC's corresponding  standards.
<sup>
<a name="footref10">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote10">10
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>
</p>  
<p>Texas is an agreement state.
<sup>
<a name="footref11">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote11">11
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> Under Texas law, &quot;[a] radioactive  waste disposal license may be issued only to a public entity specifically  authorized by law for radioactive waste disposal.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref12">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote12">12
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> Thus, a  private commercial waste disposal facility company is barred by state law  from obtaining a license in Texas for the disposal of LLRW. 
</p>  
<p>On August 29, 1996, DOE issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in connection  with the cleanup of its Fernald nuclear site in Ohio. In the Fernald RFP,  DOE required that the bidders demonstrate that they possess, or have the  ability to obtain within 27 months of a contract award, &quot;the proper  Federal, State and Local permits and licenses for the permanent disposal&quot;  of LLRW. 
</p>  
<p>WCS's facility in West Texas is licensed to dispose of hazardous and toxic  wastes, but not LLRW. On September 20, 1996, WCS submitted a proposed bid  to the DOE for the Fernald RFP. WCS included a provision in the application  for oversight of the site by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation  Commission (TNRCC). In December, after the TNRCC withdrew from  consideration as the proposed oversight body, WCS submitted an alternative  regulatory oversight mechanism. Under either plan, WCS argues that it would  be exempt from Texas state licensing requirements because it would  effectively become a DOE-controlled facility. 
</p>  
<p>On May 5, 1997, DOE sent WCS a letter informing it that, while &quot;DOE is not  prepared to accept the WCS proposal as submitted,&quot; the agency &quot;is  considering&quot; the development of an RFP for future waste disposal contracts  that &quot;could . . . allow for alternative regulatory structures.&quot; WCS sued  DOE, arguing that DOE's refusal to consider its proposal was arbitrary and  capricious.
</p>  
<p>After a one day hearing, the district court issued an injunction enjoining  DOE from denying any WCS bid &quot;on the ground(s) that: (i) WCS is not or  cannot be licensed by Texas for the disposal of low-level radioactive or  mixed wastes; (ii) WCS is not licensed by the NRC for the disposal of low-  level radioactive or mixed wastes; or (iii) WCS has imposed or sought to  alter the provisions of the Fernald RFP relative to title to the wastes  subject thereto.&quot;

II.  DiscussionBoth sides agree that WCS' proposal for DOE regulation of

the site could lawfully be implemented.  They disagree on whether DOE has

the discretion to require a state license as a requirement for bidding.

DOE's policy requiring such a license is set forth only in its memorandum,

which is not the product of a formal rulemaking.  Moreover, even that

memorandum does not address the issue of utilizing self-regulation of the

site in place of a state license.
<sup>
<a name="footref14">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote14">14
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>  We will not give deference

to DOE's interpretation under 
<i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources

Defense Council, Inc.
</i>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), because it had not enunciated

its interpretation prior to the litigation.
<sup>
<a name="footref15">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote15">15
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>

</pre>  
<p>In granting the injunction, the district court focused on section 110a of  the AEA, which provides that
</p>  
<p>
<tt>
<blockquote>&quot;Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed . . . to require a license for (1) the processing, fabricating, or refining of special nuclear material, or the separation of special nuclear material, or the separation of special nuclear material from other substances, under contract with and for the account of the Commission; or (2) the construction or operation of facilities under contract with and for the account of the Commission.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref16">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote16">16
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>
</blockquote>
</tt>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>The district court interpreted this section to mean that the NRC, and thus  the agreement states, could not require that a private entity contracting  with DOE for LLRW disposal have a license, and that DOE could therefore not  require an NRC or state license as a precondition for bidding. The district  court, in issuing the preliminary injunction, stated that &quot;[t]he existence  of a state or NRC license is neither a necessary prerequisite nor a  sufficient basis for the receipt by a DOE contractor of DOE low-level or  mixed radioactive wastes for disposal at a private site.&quot; Although correct,  that does not answer the question of whether DOE 
<i>may
</i> require a state or NRC  license as part of the grounds for the contract.
</p>  
<p>Section 110 is found in Subchapter IX, Atomic Energy Licenses, which begins  by stating that it is unlawful for anyone &quot;to transfer or receive in  interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, use,  import, or export any utilization or production facility except under and  in accordance with a license issued by the Commission.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref17">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote17">17
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> As DOE  argues, it appears clear that the introductory phrase, &quot;nothing in this  subchapter,&quot; limits &sect; 110 to production and utilization facilities. WCS  argues that such a reading renders the two subsections superfluous.  However, the second subsection addresses the &quot;construction or operation of  facilities under contact with and for the account of the Commission.&quot; The  first subsection addresses the issue the handling of &quot;special nuclear  material,&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref18">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote18">18
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> focusing on activities rather than facilities. 
</p>  
<p>This interpretation is supported by NRC's regulations. The regulations  provide that a contractor of the DOE is exempt from the licensing  requirements &quot;to the extent that such contractor . . . receives . . .  byproduct material for: (a) The performance of work for the Department at a  United States Government-owned or 
<i>controlled
</i> site.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref19">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote19">19
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>  Logically, if DOE does not &quot;control&quot; the site, then the contractor is  subject to the ordinary NRC licensing requirements.
<sup>
<a name="footref20">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote20">20
</a>&nbsp;
</sup>
</p>  
<p>If DOE chooses to regulate, or &quot;control&quot;, the private waste disposal sites,  then the sites are exempt from NRC and state licensing requirements.  Where, however, DOE does not exercise such control, the NRC and the  agreement states retain their power to regulate commercial sites providing  a service to DOE. Nothing in the statute indicates that DOE 
<i>must
</i> exercise  regulatory authority over such sites. 
</p>  
<p>WCS directs our attention to other statutes, arguing that they indicate  that DOE must facilitate competition. DOE's enabling statute, the  Department of Energy Organization Act, specifies that one of the founding  purposes of DOE is &quot;[t]o assure, to the maximum extent practicable, that  the productive capacity of private enterprise shall be utilized in the  development and achievement of the policies and purposes of this  chapter.&quot;
<sup>
<a name="footref21">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote21">21
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> The overall federal procurement policy provides  that, with limited exceptions, &quot;an executive agency in conducting a  procurement for property or services . . . shall obtain full and open  competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with  the requirements of this subchapter&quot; and the Federal Acquisition  Regulation.
<sup>
<a name="footref22">
</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#footnote22">22
</a>&nbsp;
</sup> Neither of these statutes, however, direct the DOE  to promote competition to the exclusion of other concerns, such as safety  and state involvement.
</p>  
<p>WCS is effectively asking the courts to intrude into the agency's policy  making process without a statutory basis. We reverse the grant of the  preliminary injunction and order dismissal of the suit against DOE. The  mandamus action against the trial judge based on his order that high-  ranking DOE officials attend the settlement discussions is also dismissed  as moot.
</p>  
<p>REVERSED. The district court is ordered to dismiss the case.
