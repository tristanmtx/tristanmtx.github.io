Waste Control Specialists is transferring more of its operations into the Andrews County facility, and any rumors that the firm has been sold are "total hogwash."
<BR><BR>
That's the word from new WCS chief executive officer Eric Peus, who talked about the company's recent changes on Friday at a meeting with the Andrews Industrial Foundation, county commissioners, and city council and school board members.

<BR><BR>

Peus replaced Ken Bigham as CEO when majority owner Harold Simmons decided to make a change in operations.
<BR><BR>

Bigham still has "some ownership, but will have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the company," said Peus. "He will act as a consultant and I won't hesitate going to Ken for advice."
<BR><BR>
Peus said Simmons "wanted more say in the company and now owns just under 75 percent of WCS.
"Nothing is going to change ownership-wise," he said. "Any rumors you might hear about a change in ownership are total hogwash.  Mr. Simmons is committed to improving the licensing of the Andrews facility and he wants to make good things happen here."

Three other employee changes were recently made by WCS.  Alan Hunt of Haliburton is the new chief financial officer and will be based in Dallas, Paul Nallon is the new Andrews facility general manager after serving in that position on an interim basis since February, and Vernon Dobb is the new safety manager at the Andrews plant.

WCS has closed its Pasadena operation and all work will now be handled in Andrews.
<BR><BR>
The Pasadena office had 15 employees, but none of them will be transferred to Andrews.
<BR><BR>
Peus said the company is "looking at the needs for the Andrews facility... trying to determine how many will be needed here overall."
<BR><BR>
He emphasized that "these changes are very positive for Andrews. It makes sense to have all of our operations here where the plant is.
<BR><BR>
The Andrews operation, including the downtown office and sales staff, has more than 100 employees "and we'll have more as the work increases," according to Peus. He said he would especially like to see the laboratory facilities at the plant enlarged and improved.
<BR><BR>
In looking to the future, Peus said "WCS will continue to strive toward improving our licenses and concentrate on expanding the capacity of the local mixed waste treatment and storage facility."
<BR><BR>
Peus also said that WCS plans to go back to the next Legislature, which will convene in January of 2001, to seek legislation that will allow private companies to dispose of radioactive waste. 
<BR><BR>
That's where we will need help... lobbying these people.  We'd like to see the Andrews County people involved earlier in the Legislative session this next time," he said.


<BR><BR>
 In response to a question about community involvement by City Councilman Brad Bunn, Peus said that WCS will continue to have its open-door policy... to keep the public informed about WCS issues."
