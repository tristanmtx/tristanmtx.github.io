This letter refers to a shipment of radioactive waste material sent to the commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal site operated by US Ecology, Incorporated, near Richland, Washington. The material, listed as Radioactive Material - low specific activity, n.o.s. and US D.O.T. Non Regulated Material on RSR #01029, was shipped on May 4, 2001, and was received on May 7, 2001. Inspections of your shipment 402259418 revealed the following violations of Washington Administrative Codes (WAC), US Ecology's Radioactive Materials License (WN-I019-2) and US Department of Transportation regulations (Title 49 CFR):
