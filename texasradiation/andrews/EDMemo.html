<B>Re:</B> Radioactive Waste Dump Could Be Disastrous for Texas
<BR>
<B>Date:</B> April 27, 2001


Your voices are needed to help head off a potential disaster in the making. 
<BR><BR>
The Texas Senate is poised to take up a bill that would authorize a for-profit 
low-level radioactive waste dump in Texas. The proposal openly calls for the 
importation of federal radioactive waste—waste that was generated by the Department 
of Energy (DOE) during production of nuclear warheads. The dump could also be opened 
to waste from nuclear reactors around the country. The State of Texas would ultimately 
take title to that waste, and the potential liability is staggering. By approving this bill, 
our lawmakers may well commit future generations of Texans to billions and billions of dollars 
in clean-up expenses. 

<BR><BR>

<B>Overview</B>
<BR>
The bill is SB 1541, sponsored by Senator Robert Duncan of Lubbock. We have been
critical of Duncan's proposal, but it became far worse last week when it was
amended in the Senate Natural Resources Committee with a 16-page amendment that
Senator Duncan himself opposed. 


<BR><BR>



The amendment was sponsored by Senator Teel Bivins of Amarillo, who represents
Andrews County, the most likely site of the dump. Bivin's amendment, which one
industry lobbyist termed "a hostile takeover,"  explicitly allows for the
importation of radioactive waste from the Federal Government. Bivins stated that
"in order for a site to be economically viable, it has to be able to take
additional [DOE] waste."

<BR><BR>


The primary beneficiary of the Duncan/Bivins bill is Waste Control Specialist,
Inc., the only firm interested in opening a dump. The Bivins amendment provides
for the licensing of two adjacent dumps, to be roughly a mile apart. The first
dump would handle waste from member states of the Texas Compact (Maine, Vermont &
Texas), while the second dump would be licensed to bury federal (DOE) waste from
outside Texas. There is no limit placed on the amount of DOE waste that could be
buried at the second dump.

<BR><BR>


Commercial waste generators in Texas, Maine, and Vermont are expected to generate
less than 2.7 million cubic feet of waste over the next 35 years. Bivins has said
that WCS will build a dump with a capacity for <I>350 million cubic feet</I>  of
low-level waste (LLRW) and mixed low-level waste (mixed with hazardous
chemicals). The DOE is expected to generate 93 million cubic feet of LLRW through
2008. Another massive quantity of LLRW will be produced by nuclear reactors
across the country as they are dismantled. This waste could also be brought to
Texas, thanks to a loophole in the Texas Compact law. This provision allows the
Compact Commissioners to open a Texas Compact dump to outside waste.

<BR><BR>

<B>The State Will Be Liable for Nuclear Power Plant Waste</B>
<BR>
Although there is no requirement for states to take title to LLRW under SB 1541,
the State of Texas would own the waste and the land at the compact site, and
would be liable for accidents and clean-up in the future when the dump leaks. As
noted above, a compact dump in Texas can be opened to massive amounts of
non-compact waste. There are 103 nuclear power plants in the U.S. nearing the
ends of their licenses. No other state has opened a compact facility in the 20
years since Congress authorized the formation of state compacts. It appears that
every state is waiting for someone else to take the bait.


<BR><BR>


<B>The State is Ultimately Responsible for U.S. Weapons Waste</B>

<BR>



In response to criticism that Duncan's bill exposed the State to liability for
large amounts of non-Compact waste, Bivins wrote his amendment to provide that
the Federal Government must assume title and liability for the waste it sends to
a Texas site. This is required in the bill as a condition of any contract that
the dump operator would obtain for the disposal of federal waste. Title to the
federal waste would be transferred to the DOE before the license is terminated,
and the land would be transferred to the DOE after the license is terminated.
Ostensibly, the DOE would accept liability for remediation of the site when it
leaks.  <B>However, this is NOT a guarantee that the site will be cleaned up.</B> 
Consider the following cases where the Federal Government has failed to clean up its mess:


<BR>
<BR>
<ul>
<li> <I>DOE Site in Texas Still Contaminated After 10 years</I>
In Texas, the DOE was responsible for cleaning up the Susquehanna uranium mill-tailings dump near Falls City. According to the DOE, hazardous and radioactive materials leached into the aquifer below the Susquehanna site and migrated at least 2,500 feet from the tailings piles. The DOE agreed to take responsibility for cleaning the aquifer, but balked at the price tag: $384 million. The DOE instead decided to allow the aquifer to "flush" itself clean, which will take at least a century. The State accepted the DOE plan. Not surprisingly, the aquifer is still contaminated.
<BR><BR>

<li> <I>Federal Government Cuts Funding for DOE Clean-Up Responsibilities</I>
According to the LA Times, April 24, 2001, the Bush Administration has omitted any money from the federal budget to continue the clean-up of a huge uranium slag heap in Utah that has been leaking radioactive waste into the Colorado River—a source of drinking water for 25 million people. The uranium waste heap is a DOE clean-up project. The waste was generated by a private company called Atlas Corp., which produced uranium for nuclear weapons.  Atlas went bankrupt in 1998. Cost estimates for removing the pile range from $300 million to $1 billion. The Bush administration may decide that it is too expensive and not necessary to move the pile at all. 
<BR><BR>

<LI> <I>DOE Lowers Clean-Up Standards in Order to Decrease the Cost of Clean-Up</I>
At Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory, the DOE changed their groundwater remediation requirement from 5 parts per billion for volatile organic compounds—the level it originally promised in a legally binding decision—to 25 parts per billion because it was a quicker, cheaper "solution."  Instead of cleaning up the plume of contamination in groundwater at the site, the DOE chose to "complete" its remediation by creating a "containment zone" within site boundaries. The DOE guaranteed that groundwater beyond the site boundaries met federal limits for pollutants, but never cleaned the site.
</ul>




<B>What Will it Cost to Clean Up a Mountain of Nuclear Waste?</B>

<BR>

No one can say for certain what it will cost in twenty-five, fifty or
seventy-five years to clean up a 350 million cubic foot dump situated above an
aquifer. A 1998 DOE report on the subject estimated that for a radioactive waste
dump handling just 1.5 million cubic feet of waste, the cost of cleaning up the
dump would be <I>$370 million.</I>  Using that cost ratio ($246 per cubic foot), Texas
would incur a liability of $86,333,000,000 in 1998 dollars. That's about 21 times
the size of the U.S. GDP.

<BR><BR> 

While we can only speculate about the clean-up costs that Texas
taxpayers will be liable for, we do know two things for certain: every nuclear
waste dump in America has leaked contaminants (other than a new site in Utah),
and every dump has to be cleaned up eventually. The table below gives some idea
of the potential clean-up costsæand the liability that would fall upon the
shoulders of our children and grandchildren.

It should be noted again that while the Bivins amendment seeks to make the
Federal Government liable for any waste it sends to Texas, <I>that provision in no
way reduces Texas' liability for the Compact dump and non-compact waste that goes
to it.</I>   Moreover, the legal feasibility of Bivins' liability provision for DOE
waste remains to be seen. No proposal like this has arisen anywhere in the
country, and there is no existing case law to inform us on the likely outcome of
litigation.

<Br><BR>


<B>Bad Policy, Bad Politics</B>
<bR>
The very premise of this bill is badly skewed. It is desired by one private
company that is tantalized by the prospect of enormous profits, and one rural
county and its senator for the purpose of economic development. Harold Simmons,
the billionaire owner of Waste Control Specialists, has contributed over $400,000
to Texas politicians since 1997. He has given Governor Rick Perry $210,000,
making him the Governor's third biggest contributor.<SUP>3</SUP> Perry will appoint the
TNRCC officials who will license and regulate the dump, and he will appoint six
of the eight Compact Commissioners. As we noted earlier, a compact dump in Texas
can be opened to out-of-state waste by a majority vote of the Compact Commission.

<BR><BR>
According to Senator Duncan, the purpose of licensing a dump is to meet Texas'
obligations under the Texas Compact. In light of the facts, and the intentions
made clear by Senator Bivins, we find that argument dubious. The bulk of LLRW
produced by Compact members (Texas, Maine, Vermont) will come from two nuclear
power plants in Texas and one in Vermont.

<BR><BR>

The waste from the Maine Yankee power plant, which was closed in 1997 and is now
being dismantled, is not bound for Texas. 40% of the plant has been taken apart
so far, and most of the radioactive waste has been sent to sites in Utah and
South Carolina. Maine Yankee also plans to store some of its waste on-site.
<BR><BR>

Decommissioning of Texas' two nuclear reactors is not scheduled to begin until
2030. According to the Duncan/Bivins bill, licenses for the operation of the
for-profit dump will last thirty-five years. But a licensee is not required to
operate a dump for the duration of the license. <I>A private company might in fact
abandon operations of a compact dump before decommissioning of Texas' reactors
begins--especially if it calculates that it has already maximized its potential
profit from dumping DOE waste.</I>  
<BR><BR>
Consequently, there is a very real prospect that in the name of finding a disposal 
site for Texas Compact waste, Duncan and Bivins might be authorizing the creation
 of massive nuclear waste dump that will actually handle very little radioactive
  waste from Compact members.
<BR><BR>


The most forthright explanation for this bill is the desire of West Texas
lawmakers to bring development to an isolated, rural county. But only 14,000
people reside in Andrews County, and the economic activity that would be created
by the dump is vastly outweighed by the massive liability that the entire the
State would incur. Our state leaders would be far wiser to give Andrews County a
direct grant for some alternate form of economic development.

<BR><BR>


<B>Bad for Texas, Especially West Texas</B>
<BR>
As the national leader in toxic and carcinogenic industrial emissions over the
last decade, Texas can hardly  afford to become known as the national nuclear
burying ground. According to a March 10 article in the <I>Houston Chronicle,</I> 
Houston's reputation for unhealthy air is causing the city difficulty in
attracting employers, skilled workers and tourist dollars. Despite concerted
efforts to improve the damage done to Houston's reputation, the Greater Houston
Partnership estimates that it will take 10 years for Houston to shed its bad air
image.

<BR><BR>

If that is the effect of a reputation for bad air, what will be the impact on
tourism in West Texas when the region is home to a massive nuclear waste dump?
Earlier this month Big Bend National Park was placed on a list of the 10 most
endangered parks in the country because of poor air quality and diminished river
flows. Area residents are very concerned about the impact the news will have on
tourism. The establishment of a massive dump could do irreparable harm to the
region's growing tourist economy.

<BR><BR>

<B>What Would Happen if No Legislation on Radioactive Waste Passes?</B>
<BR> 
Texas is NOT in a state of crisis with its  radioactive waste. Approximately
45 entities in Texas generate waste on an annual basis, according to the Texas
Department of Health, Bureau of Radiation Control.<sup>4</sup>
<BR><BR>
Of these, only about a third generate more than 15 cubic feet of waste annually.
15 cubic feet of waste would fit into a 2' x 2' box. Many hospitals and
universities store small quantities of waste on site. This type of waste tends to
have a very short half-life, and can be disposed of in an ordinary landfill after
a short time. All radioactive waste storage is regulated by the Texas Department
of Health.
<BR><BR>

The four largest radioactive waste generators— South Texas Nuclear Project,
Comanche Peak nuclear plant, Waste Control Specialist's waste processing facility
(imported waste), and Rhodia Rare Earths Inc.— account for 97% of all the waste
generated in Texas on an annual basis (36,503 ft<sup>3</sup> out of 37,723 ft<sup>3</sup>).  These
generators can continue to ship waste to an out-of-state facility, or store waste
on site until it decays enough to be dumped in an ordinary landfill. The disposal
facility in Barnwell, South Carolina will remain open until 2010. A new disposal
facility in Utah is also accepting low-level radioactive waste. The Sierra Club
does not support the export of Texas waste to other states, but we are not in a
crisis.
<BR><BR>

<B>What About PANTEX?</B><BR> 
The PANTEX facility in Amarillo does not generate appreciable amounts of
low-level radioactive waste. The operation involves the dismantling of nuclear
warheads, which contain highly radioactive plutonium. The plutonium pit in the
warhead is removed and placed in above-ground bunkers at the site. PANTEX  will
not be impacted by the passage or defeat of SB 1541.
<BR><BR>
<B>Our Solution</B> 
<BR>
Persistent radioactive waste can never be "disposed" of and
forgotten. Retrieval of buried waste is enormously expensive and technically
difficult, and generally doesn't occur until massive environmental damage has
been done. The only responsible way to handle radioactive waste is to store it in
non-permeable containers and repackage the waste when the container is no longer
viable. The Sierra Club advocates solutions for radioactive waste storage that
acknowledge this hard reality.

<BR><BR>
We believe that each state should take responsibility for its own waste to the
greatest extent practicable. Our organization and others advocate that waste
generated in Texas nuclear power plants should be managed on-site. An excellent
example of this type of storage is being put into practice right now at the Maine
Yankee reactor. The utility is storing its high-level radioactive waste in
airtight, steel and concrete containers that are placed on a concrete pad on the
plant site. This method of storage is regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which requires an approved security system and on-going monitoring.
It also allows the plant to be completely decommissioned.<sup>5</sup> We should establish a
long-term storage facility at one of Texas' nuclear power plants, limit capacity
to the volume of outstanding Texas compact waste, and require that the storage
site accept waste generated by health care providers and researchers in Texas.
<BR><BR>
For persistent radioactive waste, whether high-level or low-level, above ground
storage is the only sensible solution. This will prevent the contamination of new
areas, and assign responsibility for the waste to the appropriate parties. This
policy is grounded in common sense and equity, and it also forces utilities to
consider the true costs of building nuclear reactors.
<BR><BR>

<B>The Texas Legislature Should REJECT SB 1541</B>
<BR>
We should not import nuclear waste in the name of economic development, and we
should not accept a bill that has been written by WCS attorneys with that goal in
mind. Our radioactive waste situation in Texas is stable, and we have no pressing
need for a dump. Our lawmakers should kill this bill, go back to the drawing
board, and return in 2003 with a responsible proposal.
