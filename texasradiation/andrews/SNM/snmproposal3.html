If SNM (Special Nuclear Material) is present in the waste, this certification form must be completed and
signed certifying the following conditions. This form and all required information must be attached to the
waste profile form and the waste manifest.
<BR><BR>
1. Please check at least one of the foliowing that applies to the waste stream:

2. Please certify that the following conditions have been satisfied by checking each box:
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">a. Concentrations of SNM in individual waste containers do not exceed the applicable values listed in
the above table and SNM isotope concentrations listed in Table 1.
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">b. The SNM is homogeneously distributed throughout the waste or the SNM concentrations in any
contiguous mass of 450 kilograms (990 Ibs) do not exceed on average the specified limits. (Based
on process knowledge or testing).
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">c. Waste does not contain "pure forms" of chemicals containing carbon, fluorine, magnesium, or
bismuth in bulk quantities (e.g., a pallet of drums, a B-2s box). By "pure forms," it is meant that
mixtures of the above elements such as magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium
fluoride, bismuth oxide, etc. do not contain other elements. (Based on process knowledge or
testing).
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">d. Waste does not contain total quantities of beryllium, hydrogenous material enriched in deuterium, or
graphite above one-tenth of one percent of the total weight of the waste. (Based on process
knowledge, physical observations, or testing).
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">e. Waste packages do not contain highly soluble forms of uranium or plutonium greater than 350
grams of uranium-235 or 200 grams of uranium-233 or plutonium. If the waste contains mixtures of
plutonium, U-233 and U-235, the waste meets the sum of the fractions rule. Highly soluble forms of
uranium (and plutonium) include, but are not limited to: uranium sulfate, uranyl acetate, uranyl
chloride, uranyl formate, uranyl fluoride, uranyl nitrate, uranyl potassium carbonate, and uranyl
sulfate. (Based on process knowledge or testing).

3.	Please indicate that the following information is attached to the Radioactive Waste Profile Record by checking each box. (Note: Only the two-page SNM Exemption Certification form needs to be
 included with each manifest, unless an alternative sampling plan was approved at the pre-
acceptance stage).

<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">a. Provide a description of how the waste was generated, list the physical forms in the waste, and
identify the uranium chemical composition and other chemicals that may be present in the waste.

<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">b. Provide a general description of how the waste was characterized (including the volumetric extent
of the waste, and the number, location, type, and results of any analytical testing), the range of
SNM concentrations, and the analytical results with error values used to develop the concentration
ranges.
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">c. Describe the process by which the waste was generated showing that the spatial distribution of SNM
must be uniform, or other information supporting spatial distribution.
<BR><BR>
<DD><img src="box.gif">d. Describe the methods to be used to determine the concentrations on the waste profile and
manifests. These methods could include direct measurement and the use of scaling factors.
Describe the uncertainty associated with sampling and testing used to obtain these concentrations.
<BR><BR>
4. Generator's certification of compliance with the SNM exemption: I certify that the information
provided on this form is complete, true, and correct and is based on process knowledge, physical
observations, or laboratory testing. I also certify that any supporting documentation and analytical
results have been submitted to WCS.
