NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
<br><br>
[Docket No. 70-7005]
<br><br>

Consideration of an Exemption From Requirements of 10 CFR Part 70
for Waste Control Specialist LLC
<br><br>
AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<br><br>
ACTION: Consideration of an exemption.
<br><br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>
SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission)
is considering issuance of an Order pursuant to section 274f of the
Atomic Energy Act that would exempt Waste Control Specialist LLC (WCS)
from certain NRC regulations. WCS requested this exemption in a letter
dated September 25, 2000. The proposed exemption would allow WCS, under
specified conditions, to possess waste containing special nuclear
material (SNM), in greater mass quantities than specified in 10 CFR
part 150, at WCS's facility located in Andrews County, Texas, without
obtaining an NRC license pursuant to 10 CFR part 70. NRC issued a
similar Order to Envirocare of Utah, Inc. in May of 1999. During the
issuance of that Order, the Commission indicated that staff should
consider similar requests from others prior to exploring rulemaking in
this area (SRM-SECY-98-226).
<br><br>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The WCS facility is approximately 1200 acres
in size and is located in western Texas, approximately 32 miles west of
Andrews, Texas. WCS is licensed by the State of Texas Department of
Health to treat and temporarily store low-level radioactive waste. WCS
is also licensed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to dispose of hazardous
waste. The hazardous waste activities at the site are not subject to
the Order currently under consideration.<br><br>

     Prior to the issuance of the Order, NRC will have made findings
required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and NRC's
regulations. These findings will be documented in a Safety Evaluation
Report and an Environmental Assessment.
