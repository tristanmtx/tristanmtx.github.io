Dear Mr. Essig:
<BR><BR>
In response to your letter of May 8, 2001 you will find attached a draft procedure that
memorializes the commitments previously made and responds to the new issues that you have
identified. This should allow the final processing of our requested exemption from 10 CFR Part
70 for possessing special nuclear material in quantities greater than those specified in 10 CFR
Part 150.
<BR><BR>
We have provided the Texas Health Department Bureau of Radiation Control with a copy of this
letter, including all attachments, to keep them informed of our progress on this issue.
<BR><BR>
You may contact me at 717-540-5220 if you have questions or require additional information to
process this request.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
[signed]<BR>
William P. Dornsife<BR>
