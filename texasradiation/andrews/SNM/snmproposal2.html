<B>1.0	PURPOSE AND SCOPE</B>
<BR>

This procedure describes the waste acceptance requirements for Special Nuclear Material, SNM.
Sampling and documentation requirements for the waste generator and for Waste Control
Specialists, WCS, are described. The procedure lists concentration limits for SNM and the
sampling frequency required for characterizing the shipments of various concentrations of SNM.
<BR><BR>
The requirements of this procedure must be satisfied for all SNM received and processed at
WCS.

<DD><B>4.3.2</B> Waste Generator Sampling Frequency Guidelines

<BR><BR>

<DD><B>4.3.2.1</B> The Waste Generator shall submit a sampling plan for characterizing the
SNM waste. The plan shall include:
<BR><BR><DD> - sampling methods,
<BR><BR><DD> - sampling points,
<BR><BR><DD> - number of samples,
<BR><BR><DD> - analysis methods,
<BR><BR><DD> - detection levels,
<BR><BR><DD> - data reduction and analysis
<BR><BR><DD> - review of the data, and
<BR><BR>
<DD> - increasing the sampling frequency when the data show higher
concentrations of SNM than originally assumed or non-homogeneous
concentrations.
<BR><BR>
<DD><B>4.3.2.2</B> The Waste Generator is expected to follow these sampling frequency
guidelines. The guidelines require a higher frequency of samples to be
obtained and documented as the concentration of SNM increases.
<BR><BR>
<DD><B>4.3.2.2.1</B> Table 2 lists the activity concentrations for each SNM
radionuclide. The columns show the concentrations (action
levels) that will define the sampling frequency.

<BR><BR>
<DD>Column 1 shows the WCS SNM concentration limit. This
value shall not be exceeded.

<BR><BR>
<DD>Column 2 shows one-tenth of the WCS SNM concentration limit

<BR><BR>
<DD>Column 3 shows one-hundredth of the WCS SNM concentration
limit.

<BR><BR>
<DD>The MDA, Minimum Detectable Activity (95% confidence level)
listed, applies to samples that are low in activity (at or below
one-hundredth of the WCS limit). When the sample contains
measurabie activity, achieving the MDA is not required...samples should be counted long enough to achieve 15% relative error (1 sigma total analysis uncertainty).

<DD><B>4.3.3</B> SNM Waste Profile Homogeneity of Concentrations
<BR><BR>
The SNM concentrations will be accepted as homogeneous if the waste profile
shows that the maximum and minimum concentrations are within a factor of 5 of
the average concentrations.

<BR><BR>

If the container sample concentration uniformity cannot be demonstrated by
process knowledge, then the Waste Generator will perform additional sampling
and additional information from the Waste Generator certifying the waste will be
required in the sampling plan:
<BR><BR>
Additional sampling requirements (Waste Generator sample and analysis) when
the homogeneity cannot be demonstrated are: One sample for every 450 kg
(990 lbs) of waste will be required unless it can be demonstrated by some other
means (process knowledge or other sampling) that there is less than 350 grams
of U-235 and less than 200 grams of U-233 or Pu in the entire waste stream that
will be sent to the site under this waste profile.
<BR><BR>
Direct sampling is the preferred method of waste characterization. Scaling
factors and/or process knowledge may be used as an alternative or supportive
method of characterization, however the information must be of sumcient detail
and quality to justify its use.
<BR><BR>
<DD><B>4.3.4</B> Sample Analysis Methods
<BR><BR>
The analysis method used to analyze the SNM should be an industry accepted
method, and analysis should only be perfommed by a certified lab.
<BR><BR>
Generally accepted methods of analysis include:
<BR><BR>
<DD>- Gamma Spectroscopy
<BR><BR>
<DD>- Isotopic Uranium (alpha spectroscopy)
<BR><BR>
<DD>- Isotopic Plutonium (alpha spectroscopy)
<BR><BR>
<DD>- Liquid Scintillation Counting by plutonium separation/alpha spec to
determine separation yield/ gas proportional counting.
<BR><BR>
<DD>- ICP mass spectroscopy
<BR><BR>
<DD><B>4.3.5</B> Waste Generator- Special Nuclear Material Exemption Certification
<BR><BR>
The Waste Generator shall complete Attachment 1 to this procedure, Special
Nuclear Material Exemption Certification, to certify that all requirements for
shipment and receipt of SNM to WCS have been met. A completed and signed
Attachment 1 shall be attached to the waste profile and the waste manifest.
<BR><BR>
<DD><B>4.3.6</B> WCS Review of Special Nuclear Material Exemption Certification and
Verification Sampling
<BR><BR>
WCS will review and approve the SNM exemption certification documentation
required in Attachment 1 using the guidelines specified in Attachment 2 for
preacceptance of SNM at the WCS facility.
<BR><BR>
WCS will review and approve the SNM exemption certification documentation
required in Attachment 1 using the guidelines specified in Attachment 3 for final
acceptance of SNM at the WCS facility. WCS will perform verification sampling
of the waste shipments when the waste arrives on site at the frequency
described in Attachment 3 to this procedure.
