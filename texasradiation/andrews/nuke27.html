WASHINGTON -- A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the top of a
million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried near Richland.
<BR><BR>

Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate pockets of
hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor sampling, threatens
other instruments and could eventually overflow, according to officials of the
Department of Energy and the contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin
Hanford Corp. They are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank,
possibly within a month.<BR><BR>

In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by lancing the crust
with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they made is beginning to close.
<BR><BR>

"I don't make any claims about this tank," said Donald Oakley, a retired
environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory, hired by the Energy
Department as an outside consultant. "I'm not convinced anyone understands the
chemistry and physics involved in this crust."
<BR><BR>

At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson, manager of the
nuclear-waste program, said that before the crust was lanced, engineers were
predicting the waste would reach the top of the tank this fall. "It was 'The
Blob' kind of thing," he said.
<BR><BR>

The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the surface at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, 20 miles from Richland, a city of about 32,000
people. The waste in the tank produces unwanted hydrogen as radiation bombards
organic chemicals that were added years ago in what officials now say was a
mistaken strategy to reduce the waste's volume.
<BR><BR>

Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases that official
studies call burps, causing "waste-bergs," chunks of waste floating on the
surface, to roll over.
<BR><BR>

With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly 100-day
intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at some point it would
burp during a lightning storm and cause an explosion. "Under certain conditions,
you could rupture the tank," said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's
chief environmental official during the Bush administration. "You'd have a
challenge on your hands in the state of Washington," he said.
<BR><BR>

An explosion would spread radioactive material into the environment, experts
say.
<BR><BR>

In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.
<BR><BR>

To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department ordered
installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the hydrogen into tiny bubbles,
which engineers hoped would then rise to the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing
out of a soft drink.
<BR><BR>

For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust started to toughen
because it no longer rolled over from time to time, and it prevented the hydrogen
from coming to the surface. In December 1997, the crust began to rise, even
though virtually nothing was being added to the tank.
<BR><BR>

The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the bottom of the tank to
435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced it, with each inch representing
almost 3,000 gallons. That level was 13 inches above the maximum specified for
the tank's operation. By Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The
tank is protected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the level
at which the outer shell ends.
<BR><BR>

"We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be," said Dr. Carolyn
Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for environmental management.
<BR><BR>

The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the intake nozzle of
the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the pump, the hydrogen would begin
accumulating at the bottom again and burping to the surface, but the crust that
would then roll over would be four times bigger than it was before the pump was
installed. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far smaller,
making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that would support a fire or
explosion.
<BR><BR>

"The rollovers were spectacular, but now we've got another problem, caused by the
solution to that problem," said Stephen Agnew, a chemist who worked at Hanford
for years. "Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an end to it," he said.
<BR><BR>

Another expert, Robert Alvarez, a former senior adviser to the energy secretary
on environment, safety and health, said of the managers at Hanford: "They were
lulled into complacency and forgot the fact the pump was only meant to be a
temporary measure to mitigate the problem. They completely ignored the
fundamental problem of dispositioning these materials."
<BR><BR>

Hanford managers should have transferred some of the contents to a different tank
and diluted the rest to break up the crust years ago, he and others say.
<BR><BR>

In fact, in June 1996, the Energy Department crossed hydrogen off its list of
problems at SY-101; in October of that year, it announced that "all safety issues
with the tank are now understood."
<BR><BR>

Fran DeLozier, president of Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp., said in a telephone
interview, "It really wasn't until the fall of 1998 that everyone was convinced
the crust was growing, that we didn't know how to stop the growth and that the
solution was to do a transfer."
<BR><BR>

Even then, some people thought the department was moving too slowly. In June,
Agnew sent an e-mail to Oakley that said, "It is amazing that the level has
reached 435 inches and no one is freaked out yet."
<BR><BR>

Some experts say that they are not sure the pumping will work and that they will
not trade a bad situation (one problem tank) for a worse one (two problem tanks).
There is only one spare tank available, and some experts think the wastes may be
incompatible with other wastes that are supposed to go into it, organic liquids
from older, leaking tanks that the department wants pumped dry, and wastes from a
defunct plutonium-processing plant.
<BR><BR>

"The whole situation at Hanford is a reaction mode rather than a planning mode,"
Duffy said. "I gather they're baffled by what's going on."
