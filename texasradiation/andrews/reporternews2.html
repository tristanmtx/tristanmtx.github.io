<P><FONT SIZE="+3">Low level radioactive dump for Andrews County
is debated</FONT></P>

<P><B>By CHRIS NEWTON</B></P>

<P><B>Associated Press Writer</B></P>

<P>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) - A key Texas legislator said Saturday
that rather than support a nuclear waste dump for Andrews County,
he favors central locations for storing waste above ground in
huge vaults.</P>

<P>State Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, chairman of the House Environmental
Regulation Committee, said at a public forum on the issue Saturday
that he'll back his own plan rather than a proposal favored by
the Andrews Industrial Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated
to diversifying and improving Andrews' economy.</P>

<P>Nearly 100 people attended the forum, sponsored by the League
of Women Voters and The Midland Reporter-Telegram.</P>

<P>Without Chisum's support, any plans for a dump could face an
uphill battle.</P>

<P>&quot;We've spent $53 million in search of a magical site that
everyone agrees upon,&quot; Chisum said. &quot;We haven't found
it, and I don't think we're going to. Allowing counties to keep
the waste above ground and have it constantly monitored is a different
road, and we believe we'll be able to gain support for this idea.&quot;</P>

<P>Two companies, Envirocare of Texas and Waste Control Specialists,
are vying for the contract if Andrews County gets the state's
approval as a nuclear waste dumping site.</P>

<P>Many hurdles remain before such approval could come.</P>

<P>First, Texas legislators would have to pass a law permitting
the state to consider a site other than Sierra Blanca, a town
90 miles east of El Paso and less than 20 miles from the Rio Grande.</P>

<P>In December, capping a process that took nearly two decades,
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission vetoed Sierra
Blanca as a storage site because of a geologic fault line there.
Any future site would have to get the nod from the commission.</P>

<P>The Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Authority, charged with
the oversight of radioactive wastes, must also approve the site.</P>

<P>Doug Bell, general manager of the Authority, says the Andrews
County proposal will require more investigation.</P>

<P>&quot;There are maps that show that the Ogallala aquifer does
run under that part of the county. There is a lot of scientific
research to prove that something does not exist there.&quot;</P>

<P>The forum also focused on a University of Texas study declaring
that most maps and previous documentation show the aquifer is
beneath the proposed dumping site.</P>

<P>Throughout the forum, proponents of a dump were on the defensive.</P>

<P>&quot;I have three children and a wife and I would never support
a plan that was dangerous just for the industrial diversification
of Andrews County,&quot; said Lloyd Eisenrich, director of the
Andrews Industrial Foundation.</P>

<P>&quot;Our opponents are not asked to prove their statements,&quot;
he said. &quot;They rely upon emotion rather than facts to make
a point. Just because some group in Washington says it's bad isn't
enough to ignore the fact that we can be a site with the solution.&quot;</P>

<P>Don Moniak, president of Serious Texans Against Nuclear Dumping,
questioned proponents' tactics.</P>

<P>&quot;The problem is that this all moving way too fast,&quot;
Moniak said. &quot;It's not a matter of being opposed or not opposed
to it, it's a matter of not just following the path of least resistance.&quot;</P>

<P>Lawrence Jacobi, vice president of operations at Envirocare
of Texas, said he isn't convinced the Ogallala Aquifer isn't near
the proposed area.</P>

<P>&quot;We're interested in the possibility of making Andrews
County a site, but we're not completely sold on the idea that
it is viable,&quot; Jacobi said.</P>

<P>&quot;We are in the business of making 100 percent certain
that a site is 100 percent safe before committing in any way.&quot;</P>

<P>Kent Hance, a major stockholder of WCS and also a former congressman
and former state railroad commissioner, said he believes the Andrews
site is safe.</P>

<P>&quot;We've done the research, and we're convinced that there
is not a threat to the Ogalalla aquifer,&quot; Hance said.</P>

<P>Residents at Saturday's forum seemed divided.</P>

<P>&quot;It's hard to know what to believe, but I think there
are still some serious concerns that need to be looked at,&quot;
said Dorothy Carrington, who lives near Andrews.</P>
