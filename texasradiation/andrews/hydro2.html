<span class="newstdtext11">
In 1993, as part of its application for a RCRA Class-C hazardous waste disposal license, an extensive study by Terra Dynamics
was submitted to the TNRCC (now TCEQ) for the WCS site.  This study performed core sampling to create a underground picture of what lies under the site,
for which it reported in detailed cross-sections both the existence of the Ogallala, and the thickness of the formation.  The 
report states for each core sample that the Ogallala is just below the topsoil
 with conclusive evidence.  Later, WCS produced its own site report 
to the TDH Bureau of Radiation Control, for which an extensive land survey was not conducted.  Without presenting scientific data to 
refute the claims of other thorough studies, WCS declared that all other studies, including 
the Terra Dynamics study, misidentified the Ogallala formation, and that it was, they claimed, Antler Sandstone.  Antler sandstone is 
indigenous to the <a class="redlink12" href="antler.gif">Antlers aquifer</a> which is barely in east Texas and resides in southern Oklahoma.  
It does not extend into west Texas, and is over 300 miles away.

At the link below, I have compiled some of the more outstanding excerpts from this 1993 study
 with some of the other pertenant material found here on the Ogallala at WCS's site.
 This is a 21 MB PDF file, so I advise against downloading from a slow internet connection<BR>

<BR><BR>
Andrews County has been rejected in the past for a disposal facility by other state agencies over the presence of the Ogallala.
Although the Terra Dynamics study remains on file at the Bureau of Radiation Control, the Bureau never questioned WCS's claims
in this matter, and did not do their own Environmental Assessment.  The Bureau never bothered to check the facts, and failed 
to regulate proper siting criteria.  We charge WCS with submitting false information, that the site is geologically unsuitable, 
and charge the TDH Bureau of Radiation Control with failing to enforce or investigate siting criteria, which demonstrates a failure 
to do its job to regulate.</span>

    This  is a photo of a geologist pointing out a
    major recharge feature at the Andrews site (in the huge onsite "pit")
     known as a 'sand worm' or 'sand tube'.  This is where percolating, flowing waters
     have removed the organic matter from the clay over millions of years, leaving behind sand in a 
     tube form connecting the aquifers beneath to  the surface water collection 
     forms known as playa lakes.  There are 19,500 playa lakes
     in the southern high plains of Texas that feed the enormous Ogallala aquifer 
     as well as the numerous minor aquifers.
