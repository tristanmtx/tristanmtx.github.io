    <h3><!--HEADLINE BETWEEN HERE-->Report indicates Andrews site may be unsuitable<!--AND HERE--></h3>
    <h4><!--SUBHEAD BETWEEN HERE-->UT study discloses presence of Ogallala aquifer in proposed nuclear waste site.<!--AND HERE--> </h4>
    <p><em><!--BYLINE BETWEEN HERE-->By Greg Harman <!--AND HERE--><br>
    Odessa American</em></p>
    <p><!--STORY BETWEEN HERE-->A study released by the University of Texas at Austin&#146;s Bureau of Economic Geology
    shows the geology of western Andrews County may be unsuitable for radioactive waste
    disposal.</p>
    <p>The report, released late last month and made public Tuesday, said the Ogallala aquifer
    is located beneath land owned by Envirocare of Texas and may also lie beneath Waste
    Control Specialists&#146; hazardous and low-level radioactive storage facility.</p>
    <p>Both companies have proposed their facilities be used to dispose of low-level
    radioactive waste from Texas, Maine and Vermont.</p>
    <p>Concerned mainly with the possible location of underground water beneath the two sites,
    the report prepared by the bureau&#146;s research scientist, Alan Dutton, questions the
    methodology behind a recent report by Texas Tech University scientists, paid for by
    Pasadena-based Waste Control Specialists.</p>
    <p>The Texas Tech report concludes that the Ogallala aquifer was not beneath the WCS site.</p>
    <p>&quot;He states that Ogallala is absent at the WCS site,&quot; Dutton&#146;s report
    said. </p>
    <p>&quot;No scientific description or documentation were included with the text . . . to
    substantiate these interpretations.&quot;</p>
    <p>The report also states that &quot;the description of core materials&quot; at the WCS
    site resemble those found at Envirocare&#146;s 888 acres, located eight miles southeast of
    Envirocare&#146;s unimproved lands.</p>
    <p>Wet core samples taken from the Envirocare of Texas site reflect the presence of
    groundwater, the report said. </p>
    <p>Core samples taken from the WCS site for the company&#146;s 1993 application for
    radioactive waste disposal also were wet.</p>
    <p>Both companies have touted the presence of the Red Bed Ridge, a thick bank of
    &quot;impermeable&quot; clay, on their lands as suitable for disposal of radioactive
    materials.</p>
    <p>Dutton&#146;s report said the ridge itself may not be as old as previously reported,
    and that the thickness of the High Plains aquifer increases along the ridge by 1.25 feet
    per mile to the southeast.</p>
    <p>Groundwater &quot;recharge&quot; may be occurring at either location, the report says.</p>
    <p>&quot;A saturated section can develop and build up across the &#145;Red Bed Ridge&#146;
    in a given area that is presently unsaturated,&quot; the report reads.</p>
    <p>The report said the &quot;conditions&quot; at the WCS location &quot;might at a later
    time come to resemble&quot; those at Envirocare of Texas land areas.</p>
    <p>Texas law forbids either site from being considered for radioactive waste disposal
    unless it can be proved that the Ogallala aquifer is not &quot;recharged from or
    discharged to&quot; either site area, a 1987 letter by Rick Jacobi, former manager for the
    Authority states.</p>
    <p>The report said further study of the WCS site and lands in the south-central part of
    the county, near the border with Ector and Winkler counties, is needed.</p>
    <p>The Texas Low-Level Radioactive Disposal Authority, the state agency charged with
    siting and operating a low-level radioactive waste dump in Texas for industry, educational
    and medical wastes from Texas, Maine and Vermont, requested the report from the Bureau of
    Economic Geology in January. </p>
