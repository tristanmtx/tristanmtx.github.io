Subject:	Proposed shipments of LANL Waste to WCS facility in Texas
<BR><BR>
Dear Mr. Cortez,
<BR><BR>
The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is proposing to ship a number of mixed
low-level radioactive wastes (MLLRW) generated at their site in the comlng year
to Waste Control Specialists in Andrews, Texas. The proposed waste streams will
be treated at WCS and then either sent to Envirocare in Utah or returned to LANL
for future disposal.
<BR><BR>
Department of Energy requirements for radioactive waste management are contained
in DOE Order 435.1, entitled "Radioactive Waste Management". This document, along
with subsequent guidance, requires preparation of an exemption request to use
commercial, non-DOE facilities for waste management. One of the many requirements
of DOE Order 435.1 is that host States be consulted prior to approval of use
non-DOE, commercial facilities located in their states.
<BR><BR>
LANL has prepared such a exemption request package which is currently being
reviewed at DOE/ Albuquerque. I am sending this email to you to inform you of our
intent to approve such shipments once all the requirements have been met.
<BR><BR>
In addition, DOE requires notification of the host State prior to each shipment.
We intend to make such notifications via email in the future. If for some reason
you do not desire such notifications, please so indicate.
<BR><BR>
Please acknowledge the receipt of this information. If you have any questions
concerning this notification, please call or email me. Thank you for your
consideration.
