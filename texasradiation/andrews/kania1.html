Dear Mr. Kania:
<BR><BR>
The Bureau of Radiation Control was recently informed by staff of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission of your intent to dispose of some material in your hazardous waste facility
that contains naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). They referred to an internal Waste
Control Specialists Andrews Facility Radioactive Material Regulatory Interpretation Notice as the basis
for acceptance of the waste. The Interpretation Notice states that the determination of radioactive
material concentrations for purposes of disposal of exempt level NORM can be averaged over an entire
shipment from the same generator, as long as the materials have similar characteristics and result from
a single decontamination or decommissioning project.

<BR><BR>


The Interpretation Notice also stated that the position is supported by a letter dated March 6, 1999, signed
by me, to Charles Dartez of Woodward-Clyde. The letter that I sent dealt with a single railcar load of
NORM that was assumed to be well characterized by the generator and had also been sampled by Texas
Department of Health staff. The reference to average concentration was not meant to apply to any entire
shipment from a generator or for a generator to be able to average concentrations of material over an
entire decommissioning project. In addition, the 30 picocuries per gram exemption limit for NORM
other than that from oil and gas production is only applicable if the radon emanation has been
characterized and found to be below the limit listed in the regulations.
<BR><BR>
If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at (512) 834-6689.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
