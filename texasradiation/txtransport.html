<B>Transportation to WIPP: Hazards of Transuranic Waste Shipping Containers</B>
<BR>
Shipping containers for transporting transuranic waste on the highways to WIPP are called TRUPACTs.
The safety of the TRUPACT-II containers has come under scrutiny for a number of reasons.
The majority of the tests conducted by the NRC were computer simulations, and not actual tests.
One actual test included dropping a canister 30-feet into concrete.
In the first two of these tests, the outer shell had breached.  Although the DOE estimates that
 40% or more of the contents of a TRUPAC container will be combustible materials, there were no tests
 done to determine the effects of an internal fire.
 
 <BR><BR>
Shipments to WIPP will cross 22 states.
Initially, 1450 shipments a year were estimated to arrive at WIPP, and that rate has nearly been reached.   
In August 2001, WIPP reached 14 shipments a week, and for 2002 expects to reach at least 
24 shipments a week.

From the 38,089 TRUPACT shipments scheduled over the next 35 years the DOE has estimated that 6 deaths and 48 
injuries would result from accidents, and that an additional 3 people would die from radiation exposure.
Since the DOE doesnt consider an accident will release radioactivity these numbers are expected to be much higher.
  Rail transport has been estimated to result in 10 times lower exposures to the public, and
  100 times lower doses to workers than the truck shipments, but trains are not being 
  considered for use in WIPP shipments.
<BR><BR>

Two traffic accidents involving TRUPACT shipments to WIPP occurred within a month apart in 2002.

<B>Transportation to Yucca Mountain - Risks of High-Level Waste Transportation</B>
<BR>

Yucca Mountain shipments would pass through 734 counties in 44 States. 

The transportation casks have not been fully tested to ensure they could withstand 
realistically severe crashes.  Motions have been in process to adopt IAEA standards for 
transportation containers, which would weaken US standards.  Also, the waste will make 
a tempting terrorist target as it rolls across the country
<BR><BR>
Tests at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground and Sandia National Labs found that shipping 
containers are vulnerable to shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles and high explosives. 
Terrorists would not have to steal radioactive material and smuggle it into a population 
center; they could wait for the Energy Dept. and nuclear industry to do the hard part for them.
This would result in a situation worse than any dirty bomb senario. 
<BR><BR>
Wastes stored on-site at reactors
across the U.S. must be immediately fortified, bunkered with thick
concrete to guard against attack. 
Waste shipments by truck, train, and
barge between the reactors and Yucca
cannot be fortified: they'd be too heavy to move.   
<BR><BR>

It is unlikely that emergency workers 
would be prepared to adequately handle such potential disasters. DOE estimates nearly 300
 crashes could occur while this dangerous waste is being 
shipped to Nevada.  NIRS says 450 (15 a year) over 30yrs.  Each transport container holds the equivalent of up to 240 times the
radioactivity that was released in the Hiroshima bomb.
<BR><BR>
Current
reports show that even the release of a small fraction of the contents of a nuclear waste cask during an
accident could contaminate 42 square miles and if it occurs in a city (which is the greatest likelihood)
require over $9.5 billion per square mile to clean up. Knowing this, the nuclear industry has lobbied to
create laws exempting them from any liability once the nuclear waste has left the reactor. It will be the
U.S. taxpayers who will be paying the huge cleanup costs.
<BR><BR>
Over 1/3 of our nation's populations lives near these radioactive highway routes threatened by these
accidents waiting to happen. For cities like Las Vegas and Salt Lake City the danger is even greater, as
all of these shipments would pass close to schools, businesses and homes with hundreds of
thousands exposed to the potential radioactive disaster waiting to happen.
<BR><BR>
The Price Anderson Act limits radioactive waste companies' liability for accidents to $9.4
billion. Clean-up costs for an accident with this waste are estimated at $14 to $313 billion by
the State of Utah's Dept. of Environmental Quality.

<B>What <a class="redlink12" href="http://www.mapscience.org/">MapScience.org</a> 
says about Texas and Yucca Mtn:</b>
<BR>

Transporting nuclear waste to Nevada does not get rid of nuclear waste in
Texas. Instead, shipping high level nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain adds
new transportation security risks that residents of Texas will have to deal
with for 38 years beginning in 2010.
<BR>
<table border=0><TR><TD width="400"><span class="newstdtext10">
&bull; The Comanche Peak and South Texas Project reactors in Texas will still have 1,637 and
1,307 metric tons of high level nuclear waste on-site when the Yucca Mountain Project is
completed.
<BR><BR>
&bull; When the Yucca Mountain Project is completed there will be roughly the same amount of
high level nuclear waste at power plants across the country as there is today.
<BR><BR>
&bull; The only reactors that will get rid of their waste completely, according to the Department of
Energy, are those that are closed today.
<BR><BR>

&bull; High-level nuclear waste in Texas now - 1,141 metric tons.  
High-level nuclear waste in Texas if Yucca Mt. Project proceeds to completion - 2,944 metric tons.


</td></tr></table>
<BR><BR>
Shipping 77,000 metric tons of high level nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain means thousands of
nuclear waste shipments through Texas, many from out of state. The proposed routes move
potentially lethal nuclear waste through Texas's major population centers including 
Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso.

&bull;  In the event of an accident where radiation is leaking, first responders, local police, fire and

costs of $10 billion or more.


<BR><BR>
&bull;  Three-quarters of all firefighters in the United States are volunteers. These men and women
are being offered voluntary radiation training, but it is extremely unlikely that the nations' 2
million first responders will be properly trained and equipped to respond to a serious leak of
high level radiation from a transportation wreck or a terrorist incident.

<B>Transportation to Andrews</B>
<BR>
Transportation routes to Andrews and other LLW processing sites in Texas are not posted.
 DOE documents show that between 1971 and 1994 there were 306 accidents
 involving 3,649 containers of "low-level" radioactive waste. Of these, 236
 containers were damaged and 149 resulted in an unspecified amount of radiation
 being released into the environment. 
 
 <BR><BR>
On August 24th 2001, it was revealed that a 22-ton shipment of
 waste from a Illinois gaseous diffusion plant had headed for Andrews, and was lost for
 nearly a month when found dumped on a North Texas cattle ranch near Oklahoma
 piled on plastic and covered with dirt. 
 <BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

Trivia Time: During the following 78th Texas State Legislature, Sen Bivins again released WCS's
bill -which would allow them to dump vast amounts of DOE waste- in the Senate, it was originally 
 ironically numbered as Senate Bill 824- corresponding to the date that the above blunder was reported to 
federal authorities [NRC Daily Event Notification Listing 08-24-2001 EN#38227].  
Later, it was the identical House version, HB1567,  which was passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor.
