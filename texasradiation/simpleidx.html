	<br>
							
							<span class="text12"><font color="#FFFF88">
							Since 1997, Waste Control Specialists LLC, (WCS) has operated a mixed waste processing facility
							on the Ogallala aquifer, including both radioactive and hazardous wastes.  
							So far they have been storing highly radioactive wastes
							and dumping materials with small amounts of radioactivity
							into a pit which is dug right into the formation.  The area is additionally seismically 
							active with a history of regional earthquakes.							
							<BR><BR>
							The WCS site in Andrews is actually dug into the Ogallala
							formation which resides 30-40 feet below the surface.  
							The company has a history of aggressive behaviour
							and political influence.  It has even blocked nominations of 
							federal regulatory officials who have upheld the law.
							
							<BR><BR>
							
							In May 2003, The 78th Texas Legislature gave WCS permission to build 
							two new enormous radioactive waste dumps- 
							one for federal nuclear weapons facility waste,
							and another for commercial power plant waste from the Texas Compact.
							These will be the first major dumps to be built in the US in decades, 
							and every nuclear waste dump ever built has leaked.

							<span class="text12"><font color="#FFFF88">

							 							
During the Cold War, Pantex was the central US assembly plant for nuclear weapons.
Afterward, this role was switched to disassembly and plutonium storage.  
Thousands of plutonium "pits" from old bombs are stored at the site.  
In the Ogallala aquifer below, chemicals from high explosives have been found 
in surrounding wells for several miles, so plutonium and tritium may follow.
							<BR><BR>
Recently, Pantex has been making small nuclear "bunker buster" B61-11 bombs, but not thermonuclear bombs,
however, the US Government plans to increase the nuclear 
weapons stockpile in the next 20 years, which means that Pantex will once again be producing large numbers of WMDs.
<BR><BR>
							Former target of the Soviet Union, and huge
							threat to global security.  
							A chain reaction of the tons of onsite plutonium would have 
							 immeasurably disasterous consequences.

	<center><B><font color="white">Risky Repair for South Texas Reactor Vessel</B></font></center>
	
	<br>
							
							<span class="text12"><font color="#FFFF88">
South Texas (Nuclear) Project is one of two Texas nuclear power plants with a long history 
of safety violations, worker intimidation, and shoddy construction.	 Like its companion Comanche Peak near Ft Worth,
it forces billions of dollars in cost overruns on cities who are utility partners, who don't even recieve significant 
percentages of power from the plant in return for their contracts.					
							<BR><BR>
In February 2003, one of the two reactors at the plant was found to have a major coolant leak, which
was on the reactor vessel itself.  Although experts recommend that a reactor vessel be replaced 
entirely, and not patched with a weld, plant operators insist on repairing the vessel in this manner.
This significantly decreases the chance of recovery from a loss-of-cooling accident, and makes a meltdown more likely.
							<BR><BR>
STNP is on the opposite end of the Colorado River from 
Andrews, at the Gulf of Mexico.  Another threat to international 
security.  In event of a meltdown, Gulf winds would blow nuclear 
fallout throughout the region, threatening the Gulf Coast, Carribean, and Mexico.

	<center><B><font color="white">Deadly Yucca Mtn and WIPP Waste Transports Across Texas Highways</B></font></center>
	
	<br>
							<span class="text12"><font color="#FFFF88">
For several years, shipments have been driving across Texas to Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.
The Department of Energy (DOE) has proudly announced that the rate of these shipments have increased significantly 
without incident, despite several local incidents.  One of these involving a drunk driver, and another when a shipment 
drove off of the transport routes for miles before even noticed by the safeguard satellite tracking system.
The DOE hopes to send 1450 shipments a year, and set a recent goal of 24 shipments per week to WIPP.
From the 38,089 shipments scheduled over the next 35 years, the DOE estimated that 6 deaths and 48 injuries 
would result from accidents, and that an additional 3 people would die from radiation exposure.

<BR><BR>
Additionally, proposed routes to Yucca Mountain will add shipments of irradiated (or "spent") fuel to Texas highways 
through major metropolitan areas, including Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso.   
Over 38 years, it is projected that 8,411 truck shipments (an average of 234 per year) and an additional 
12,570 train shipments (an average of 349 per year) will be driving across Texas.  
In Texas, 2,336,290 people, 599 schools, and 76 hospitals reside within just 1 mile of these routes
(8,003,276 people, 1,414 schools, and 142 hospitals are within 5 miles).

<BR><BR>
Each of these transport containers will hold the equivalent of up to 240 times the 
radioactivity that was released in the Hiroshima bomb.  Current reports show that even the release of a small fraction 
of the contents of a nuclear waste cask during an accident could contaminate 42 square miles and if it occurs in a 
city (which is the greatest likelihood) require over $9.5 billion per square mile to clean up.
