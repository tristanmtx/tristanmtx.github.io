<B>What is Assured Isolation?</B>
<BR>
Assured isolation is a concept of waste management which proposes the interim
storage of waste at a site which will 300-500 hundred years later either be emptied
and decommissioned, or formally converted into a disposal facility.  In this manner, the
disposition of the waste is postponed, and supposedly, so is the fate of the
site to become a declared dump.  This fork in the road is a fundamental
defining characteristic of assured isolation, and each possibility is
supposedly given equal consideration, funding, and planning.
<BR><BR>
Another fundamental characteristic of an assured isolation facility is that
some basic monitoring of the waste is to be mandated, which is not required at
a waste dump.  It is for this reason that any monitoring put in place is
misleadingly called "enhanced monitoring."  In fact, there's absolutely nothing
enhanced to speak of, and what has been proposed is a simple system of cameras
and dosimeters.  In addition, external monitoring of the facility is casually
dismissed by planners as being unnecessary.  This same attitude is reflected
when it comes to the site selection criteria- the environmental requirements
for a dumpsite are repeatedly declared to be too strict to be applied to an
assured isolation facility.
<BR><BR>

When approached, assured isolation proves to be a big experiment in Texas
environmental law.  Regulations for assured isolation do not yet exist in
either federal or state law, and no federal agency provides a formal
definition.  Texas would be the testing ground for a type of facility which the
NRC and DOE have yet to actually define, and would probably become a national
model, inheriting all of the defects of this poor documentation.
<BR><BR>

<B>The Origins of Assured Isolation: A Public Relations Motive</B>
<BR>
The assured isolation concept was first presented in the 1995 Radwaste
Magazine article "Assured Storage Facilities: A New Perspective on LLW Management,"
 written by William L. Newberry, David H. Leroy, and Thomas Kerr.  


Refering to the LLRWPA, it says, "states assumed responsibility for disposal of radioactive 
waste just as public cynicism
toward government initiatives and skepticism about the safety of nuclear technologies were 
both reaching a high plateau.  The renewed efforts of states to develop new disposal sites have 
taken place against the political backdrop of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, nuclear disarmament,
and toxic waste horror stories."

<span class="newstdtext12">
 
The proposal whines that "regardless of their engineered features, the planned structures for housing 
waste are still commonly referred to as dumps.  The popular image remains that of sanitary 
landfills for radioactive waste, complete with tipping fees, wheeling seagulls and occasional
scavengers."



It also states, "like a child's chinese finger puzzle that tightens its grip as 
the victim tries harder to extricate himself, the more vigorously states attempt to site 
new disposal facilities, the more strident, vocal, and effective the opposition becomes."
<BR><BR>

"We suggest replacing the objective of permanent disposal with one that may be realistic
and politically palatable."  After the article was published, the name 'assured storage'
itself was judged to not be sufficiently "politically palatable" (and still implied 
'disposal' too much) for planners so it was changed to 'assured isolation'.

<BR><BR>

Assured storage was said to be a facility built with a 100-year deferred disposition.
Although the facility was not required to be designed to disposal facility specifications
 or siting regulation, it was proposed to be backfilled with sand when converted into a 
 permanent dump.  Active monitoring was to consist of inspection walkways, cameras, and 
 dosimetry in floor drains.  The decommissioning option for the hypothetical site is not
  discussed at any length.
<BR><BR>

<BR>
<B>The Problem of Deferred Disposition</B>
<BR>
One of the most obvious issues when approaching assured isolation is that of the 
deferred disposition of the waste.  (waste always has some disposition such as
generation, processing, storage or disposal) The nature of deferred disposition in the case
of assured isolation is such that after a 100-500 year storage period, the facility 
is to either be converted to a disposal facility or decommissioned (with the waste 
destined to be retrieved to a disposal site).  These two options, decommission or dispose 
(often referred to as retrieve or dispose) are supposedly to be given equal consideration in the
implementation process of an assured isolation facility.

<BR><BR>

This has not been the case with legislation in Texas regarding assured isolation, which has devoted
 emphasis to the disposal option and done little more than mandate a decommissioning fund without
 outlining the use of decommissioning funds. [HB1171, 1999 76th Leg.; HB3420,
 2001 77th Leg.]  This demonstrates the intent of the bill's authors, and that
it is not simply cynicism which encourages the view that there really is no serious consideration 
 or intent to decommission an assured isolation facility.


<BR><BR>



<B>Active Monitoring Used To Justify Weak Regulation</B>
<BR>
When looking at just about any regulatory aspect of assured isolation, active monitoring (or
"enhanced monitoring") is used as a sole justification for dropping standards from
the federal disposal and storage requirements [10 CFR 61].
Most literature on assured isolation calls for weak siting criteria and lack of external monitoring.
  The DOE states "the waste 
containers themselves would be accessible for ongoing
inspection from within the facility, eliminating the possibility of
radionuclide release through the groundwater pathway" 
<BR><BR>
An assured isolation facility will have inspection aisles for workers, and cameras placed in 
these corridors.  A common proposal is that a drainage system would be monitored by dosimeters
to detect a leak, although leaks outside of the drainage area would be undetectable.  This is 
obviously a very rudamentary system, with nothing enhanced about it.  

<BR><BR>
This simple internal monitoring system is used to dismiss external monitoring, emergency plans
and environmental considerations of siting an assured isolation facility.  There are some minor 
variations on this, for example, whereas the TNRCC recommended that
the siting criteria be as strong as that for a disposal facility, they had still maintained that external monitoring 
was inappropriate.

<BR><BR>

There seems to be a general attitude on this issue which reflected in
a statement of a 1999 Waste Management Symposium report by one of the
founders of the assured isolation concept:
 <BR>
 <center>
 <table border=0><tr><td width=500> <span class="courier11">"because an assured isolation facility is subject to continuous
inspection and preventive maintenance, it would not need to meet the site
characterization requirements necessary for a 10 CFR 61 disposal facility. The
problem of selecting a natural site and successfully licensing it in spite of
the unavoidable geological and hydrological uncertainty of that site then
disappears. Siting and licensing an assured isolation facility become much
simpler.   An assured isolation facility could be
built practically anywhere.  In Texas, for example, the
pragmatic solution to the problem of placement would seem to be locating the
facility in the less densely populated regions of either northern or western Texas.
An assured isolation facility could be built virtually anywhere in this
area."

<BR><BR>

<B>Mixed Messages: Accidents More Likely, Yet Emergency Plan "Inappropriate"?</B>
<BR>

In the TNRCC Legal Considerations, it actually admits that "because AI incorporates active monitoring 
and maintenance during the
service life of the facility (approximately 300 years), there may be greater potential for employee
exposure or on-site accidents than at a disposal facility which operates for a few decades before
closure and post-closure."

<BR><BR>

In the DOE literature it says that active monitoring makes an emergency 
plan to handle such accidents "unnecessary and inappropriate ... regardless of projected accident doses".

  DOE first states that
emergency procedures for disposal facilities are too strict for an Assured
Isolation facility, and proposes downgraded procedures outlined for an 11(e)2 dump, but
later concludes by saying "a requirement to prepare an Emergency Plan,
regardless of projected accident doses from the AIF,  appears to be unnecessary and inappropriate".

This sort of contradiction which is not unusual for assured isolation literature.
<BR><BR>

<B>Texas and Federal Law</b> 
<BR>
Texas is what is called an NRC "agreement state" [42 U.S.C. 2021(b), (d)(1), and (o)(2)]. 
 What this means is that the state
has chosen to regulate its own radioactive material in an agreement with the NRC, and that the state will 
enact laws which serve as functional equivalents to NRC regulations.  In this relationship,
Texas law is supposed to follow the federal lead.  In the case of assured isolation, there are no relevant 
federal laws to adopt from when drafting legislation.  Since assured isolation is not federally defined, 
the process of such drafting legislation makes Texas attempts to outline assured isolation 
incomplete and inadequate.
 
 <BR><BR>
 
 Although the NRC 
 has offered to provide their assistance, the NRC does not endorse the concept of deferred disposition.
   Federal decisionmaking processes including environmental impact statements should be conducted
    before an agreement state considers assured isolation legislation.

<B>Closing: Main Points</B><BR>

Here are ten reasons why assured isolation is a bad idea:
<BR><BR>

1. There
is no guarantee that an Assured Isolation facility would ever be placed into a
Case 1 phase of "Retrieve and Dispose."  Most, if not all literature written on assured isolation stresses the 
option to convert the facility to a disposal site, and even sometimes presents this as a goal.
It is a reasonable assumption that facility will likely be converted to a disposal site.
<BR><BR>

2. Planners
have presumed there will be no error over centuries in both the internal monitoring system, or
the containment of waste, and proclaim this to justify loose
environmental regulation and siting criteria.

<BR><BR>
3. The TNRCC study
says reduced external environmental monitoring justified, and that environmental impact
projections need not be prepared. 
Department of Energy downplays need for an environmental report required
by NEPA for preparation of Environmental Impact Statement.
<BR><BR>

4. Regulations
for assured isolation do not yet exist in either federal or state law, and no
federal agency provides a formal definition.
<BR><BR>

5. Assured isolation legislation in Texas has repeatedly misdefined assured isolation, and has 
failed to outline key points of the concept.  A primary example is the extensive outline of the
use of funds to convert the facility to a disposal site, and no mention whatsoever on how a 
decommissioning fund is to be implemented.  For this reason it must be concluded that what Texas 
legislation has outlined would not be considered assured isolation if put into practice, and suggests that point one
(about no intent to decommission) is reiterated.
<BR><BR>

6.  As an "agreement state," Texas models its radioactive material
 laws on the federal laws, such as the Atomic Energy Act.
This process does not operate in reverse.
<BR><BR>
7.  For reasons stated in numbers 4 and 6, there is a possibility that the
 DOE may legally have to regulate such a site, which would 
exclude State oversight at the facility.
<BR><BR>
8.  If an assured isolation facility license is issued to a company such as WCS, there is a high probability
that WCS will return to the DOE with a proposal as it had done in 1996 (which began the WCS v.s. DOE lawsuit).
Since federal authorities admit some confusion as to whether assured isolation is "disposal" or is "storage,"
WCS will likely claim that it is admissable as a disposal license required by the DOE to qualify for disposal
 proposals.

<BR><BR>

9. Assured isolation does not satisfy the Texas Compact's requirement for waste disposal.
  This is a matter of State record.
<BR><BR>

10. Assured isolation was openly designed to evade public and stakeholder perceptions 
by claiming to not be a disposal site.  The planners said in the original proposal
that it was a plan that was primarily designed to mislead the public- they spent 
the entire introduction discussing how it would deal with the public perception problem
faced with siting waste dumps.  Any pursuit of this option must be interpreted as an extension of this
intent.  

Monitored
aboveground retrievable storage may be the solution for Texas waste, but assured isolation is far
from filling the prescription.

<B>Reflections on the 78th Legislative Session: Misinterpretations of Assured Isolation Abound</B>
<BR>
During the 78th Session of the Texas State Legislature, it became apparent that assured isolation
was becoming a name even more removed from the concept itself.  Democrats and republicans all around 
began to use the term as a synonym, to merely be the idea of a facility utilizing 
aboveground monitored retrievable storage.  Differed disposition was never mentioned once this session.
Amendments calling for monitored aboveground retrievable storage of waste were also called
"assured isolation amendments."  Representative Chisum, who previously proposed his own version of 
assured isolation for State waste as an alternative to importing DOE waste, performed an about face, 
a full promoter of DOE waste importation.  The only bill which directly defined the concept 
(using the term "assured isolation") was presented by a democrat who ignored differed disposition 
entirely.  Assured isolation was entirely misrepresented in an unprecedented manner this session, 
not just selectively utilizing the concept, as Chisum had done before with his preference for 
disposal option, but completely ignoring any of the concept's basic historical development.
Some responded to this by saying that one of the 
authors of the concept (one of three) publically implied that assured isolation can be whatever
it is ultimately defined as (the main excuse for ignoring the concept's key points).  
In short, assured isolation was taken as a phrase literally meaning "assuring the isolation of
the waste," and nothing more.  As said earlier in this article, assured isolation is not a <B>synonym</b> 
for aboveground monitored retrievable storage, but an <B>implementation</b> of such storage 
with many strings attached in a larger plan- mainly to mislead the public that it is not a dump.
