<B>A VERY Brief History of DOE Facilities</b> 

<p class="indentpara">The Department of Energy is caretaker of all sites in the United States
which were involved in nuclear weapons manufacturing, research and development during World War II
and through the Cold War.   In 1942, the Army Corp of Engineers began to work on nuclear weapons 
at its Manhattan Engineer District, which took the more popular name "The Manhattan Project."  
This produced bombs for the initial testing of nuclear weapons and notably the two bombs 
used on the Japanese mainland at the end of WW&nbsp;II, nicknamed "Little Boy" [Hiroshima] and "Fat Man" [Nagasaki].
</p><BR>

<p class="indentpara">Soon afterward, the Atomic Energy Commission was created (with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946)
and assumed leadership of the development and production of nuclear weapons.  The preliminary 
network of small scattered private facilities was soon transformed into a complex of large 
centralized production facilities under the government agency.  The stockpiling of nuclear materials and
weapons required an extensive manufacturing process that generated enormous amounts of 
radioactive waste and considerable environmental contamination.  In addition to the nuclear fuel chain which is 
discussed in the section on weapons and power plants, plutonium production facililities and other
factories were needed to produce hydrogen weapons, and other plants were needed to create weapons 
components such as neutron triggers and tritium boosters.  During the Cold War, the United States 
operated a total of 14 plutonium-production reactors, creating approximately
100 metric tons of plutonium for its tens of thousands of nuclear warheads.
</p><BR>

<p class="indentpara">The United States had detonated 1,054 nuclear weapons at its test sites 
in Nevada and around islands in the Pacific, punching holes in the atmosphere and distributing 
fallout downwind upon unsuspecting communities.*  The Nevada Test Site hosted 904 of the these
test explosions.
The environmental consequences of the various manufacturing 
processes were also not a concern of the government during weapons development.  As a result, 
each site involved in weapons manufacturing remained riddled with groundwater contamination, 
skyrocketting local cancer rates, and massive amounts of poorly managed radioactive waste often 
buried in unlined trenches.</p><BR>

* The latest work on the effects of radioactive fallout from US weapons testing was a joint study prepared for U.S. Congress in August 2001 
by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National 
Cancer Institute entitled, 

"A Feasibility Study of the Health Consequences to the American 
Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations" <BR>

<p class="indentpara">
Redundant facilities ensured that nuclear weapons production
would not be interrupted by a problem at any single site. By the mid-1950s, all of the major weapons
complex facilities had been established.
Budgetary considerations and an abundance of formerly scarce nuclear materials resulted in a shift from
redundant sites to single-mission sites and a shutdown of some sites and materials production facilities in
the mid-1960s.  In 1975, the Atomic Energy Commission was dissolved into the short-lived Energy Research and 
Development Administration (ERDA) which was just two years later in 1977 incorporated into the Department of Energy.
As the Cold War continued, the Reagan administration continued to push for a larger 
nuclear stockpile even as the hazards of the arms race became even more apparent; 
several of these weapons production facilities were modernized and restarted.  
George Bush Sr. continued this policy, yet due to increasing public relations pressure 
and the collapse of the former Soviet Union, 
declared an end to the Cold War and nuclear weapons production was soon brought 
to a close, and most of the sites were seen as obsolete.  In 1989, an office of Environmental Management within the jurisdiction of the 
Department of Energy was created, which would oversee the mothballing and "long-term 
stewardship" of the major legacy weapons sites and constituent facilities.  In Texas, 
this meant Pantex and a small few of the uranium mining sites which the Atomic Energy 
Commission had utilized in its day.
</p><BR>


<p class="indentpara">
Throughout the United States, the Department of Energy is responsible for over 91 sites 
through the Office of Environmental Management.  These sites produce low-level 
radioactive waste ranging from low and high radioactivity soil which has been contaminated by 
leaking and operations, to previously buried unclassified waste which is not cataloged at all, 
to reactor vessels and components from plutonium production facilities which are not 
considered high-level waste merely upon the statutory technicalities of waste classification.
  
</p><BR>

<p class="indentpara">

The Office of Environmental Management's mission was to undertake cleanup operations 
of these facilities, which in many cases had been done with questionable efficiency and method.  
At the time this is being written, George W Bush as president 
has used his administration and the September 11th 2001 terrorist attack to deliver to his 
nuclear industry campaign donors renewed subsidies and a re-energized 
nuclear weapons complex, which will ensure that the lessons of the past at these 
facilities will be ignored, and that the nuclear arsenal of the United States will be
"modernized" for the 21st century.  Meanwhile, even supporters of the republican 
party who are "in the know" have spoken out in protest.  Without exception, all 
of these sites have leaked into the environment with an endless litany of horror 
stories accompanying them.  The DOE provides thier official overview of the history 
of this complex in a series of books which are currently out of print, yet are now 
available online.  They are named "Linking Legacies" and "Closing the Circle on the 
Splitting of the Atom," and are available at a DOE website named 
<a class="redlink12" href="http://legacystory.apps.em.doe.gov/">The Legacy Story: 
The History of the US Nuclear Weapons Complex</a>.  These books do not by any 
means sufficiently discuss the social injustice or violations of health and 
safety at these facilities, but does provide an organizational background 
in how the complex operates, and demonstrate the scope of cleanup operations.

<HR>

<B>Hanford Reservation - Richland, Washington<BR>
Multipurpose Weapons Development Site</b> 

<BR>

<p class="indentpara">
Located on the Columbia River, Hanford is the largest site in the DOE nuclear 
weapons complex, with many separate designated areas. 
Established in 1942, the site not only houses facilities which fabricated reactor fuel, 
but also produced uranium-238 and lithium targets for use in the production of 
plutonium and tritium, and many other tasks.  The site was fully equipped for plutonium production operations,
operating 9 reactors and 5 chemical separation facilities (which are also called "canyons").  All sites at Hanford are 
obscurely referenced by alphanumerical codes and occassionally by acronyms. Hanford's 300 Area was involved in uranium fuel 
and component fabrication.  Hanford reactors were named the
B, D, F, H, DR, C, KW, KE, and N Reactors.  
Hanford performed chemical separation in the 200 East and West Areas at the PUREX, REDOX, T and
B Plants, and 231-Z Plant.  The PUREX, UO<sub>3</sub> Plant, REDOX, and U Plant performed uranium recycling.
The 234-5 Plutonium Finishing Plant produced plutonium weapons 
components and also recycled plutonium.  

</p>
<BR>
 


 <p class="indentpara">
Hanford's B reactor was the first plutonium production reactor built in the world, and operated from 1944-1968.  
It was the source of plutonium for the historic "Trinity" test, 
and Nagasaki "Fat Man" weapon.  The nearby T Plant canyon was the world's first reprocessing canyon and
second large-scale reprocessing facility, which dissolved the irradiated fuel rods in acid to chemically 
extract the plutonium. It continued 
reprocessing until 1956.
The Hanford N Reactor, which has a graphite core, 
also produced much plutonium at Hanford;
 was the last to be built at the site, and was shut down permanently in 1986.

 There were a 
total of 14 plutonium-production reactors the United States operated during the Cold War, 
creating approximately 100 metric tons of plutonium for its tens of thousands of nuclear warheads.

 <p class="indentpara">
 

Onsite waste disposal operations include Trench 94, which holds 
the gigantic cutout hulls of decommissioned nuclear submarines.  After the spent fuel was removed from these hulls, 
they were then used to store other radioactive wastes.
Hanford also has onsite million-gallon double-walled tanks which hold high-level waste from the site's
reactor operations.  The older leaky single-walled tanks were replaced in the 1990's with double-walled 
tanks the DOE says will last for 50-years.  Mixing pumps are utilized inside the tanks to stir the 
waste slurry inside, in an attempt prevent the buildup of explosive gases.  Robotic arms are employed 
to break up and remove sludge and solidified waste inside.  Other high-level wastes onsite, such as corroding 
spent fuel elements from the N-Reactor, are kept in unlined concrete pools, creating highly contaminated and
irradiated wastewater. Hanford later became a waste disposal site for the various facilities around the DOE complex, 
and also accepted waste from outside of the DOE.  After the passage of the Low-Level 
Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act, it became a host disposal site for the Northeast 
Interstate Compact.  In recent years, waste intake has been limited to accepting only
waste from the Northeast Compact, and only Class A and NORM waste from states outside of 
the Compact agreement.  At this point, limiting waste intake has been too little, too late- 
irreparable environmental damage has been done all over the Hanford site in the name of 
Cold War rhetoric.
</p>
<BR>



 <p class="indentpara">
Pollution at Hanford has reached legendary proportions.  The site was a focus during 
a campaign by INFACT from 1983-1991, critical of General Electric's involvement 
in nuclear weapons production.  An INFACT documentary expos&eacute;d a neighboring 
stretch of highway which had been nicknamed "Death Mile" due to the large number of 
deaths and incidents of cancers, tumors, lymphomas, and other illnesses.  
When GE managed Hanford, it knowingly released extensive amounts of radiation 
into the air and water, and 27 of 28 neighboring families had suffered deadly cancers 
or birth defects.  On one occassion, the company had released a huge cloud of 
radioactive iodine into the atmosphere merely to see if the Soviets could 
track it on radar.


It included interviews with residents and the widows of workers at the plant who 
told thier stories of deteriorating health and mysterious secrecy surrounding the 
deaths of thier spouses.  Some workers were so irradiated from thier exposure at the 
plant that thier bodies were taken by the company and disposed of as radioactive waste 
while thier widows were told nothing.</p>
<BR>



 <p class="indentpara">INFACT's video is named "Deadly Deception: General Electric, 
 Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment."
It can be found at some independent rental shops, or if you want a copy, you may order 
it from INFACT by <a class="redlink12" href="http://www.infact.org/deadly.html">clicking here</a>.  
 INFACT also released a companion book, "Bringing GE to Light:
How General Electric Shapes Nuclear Weapons Policies for Profits,"
but unfortunately refuses to distribute this sort of other work from that campaign,
merely stating that they are no longer working on that issue [since General Electric
 claimed to pull out of the nuclear weapons business by leaving Hanford, which it had 
 been a part of for so many years, and the fact that INFACT's organized boycott was 
 focused on that particular company- not the nuclear weapons complex as a whole, such as 
 the "collective" of all the other companies involved in the big picture].  In essense Deadly Deception 
 becomes reduced in some ways to a portfolio piece for INFACT, since they chose the short battle
 and caved into the industry early on.  GE never really left the nuclear weapons industry, since it 
 continued to create non-nuclear components.  INFACT got alot of attention to generate public interest
 with Deadly Deception video, and could have done a great deal more with it, but dropped the ball, and 
 later went after Joe Camel instead.  Nonetheless, it is still worth seeing and showing to interested friends.
 Also look for another short film which toured theatres with INFACT's documentary called "Building Bombs."  
 It has even more information about the Hanford site.

<B>Paducah, Kentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio<BR>
Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b> 
<BR>
  <p class="indentpara">

These site's began their activities in the early 1950's to place uranium enrichment plants 
at dedicated locations.  Previously, uranium was enriched at Rocky Flat's K-25 site, discussed later.
Their sole functions have been uranium enrichment, a process which takes natural uranium and processes it so that 
  the percentage of the fissionable type of uranium is sufficiently higher for use in bombs or reactors.  
The process uses converter vessels with
 porous barriers that concentrate uranium in a gaseous form by separating out the
atoms of uranium-235 from the more abundant uranium-238.  Each of these single vessels is a stage in the larger
enrichment process- the more stages the uranium hexafluoride gas passes through, the higher its enrichment becomes.
Each of these plants use over 5,000 individual converter-vessel stages (the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge used 5,122 stages).
Today, Paducah has remained the primary facility, producing commercial reactor fuel, as the others have been shut down 
(Portsmouth was a secondary plant for the complex,<BR>
 and K-25 was the original prototype plant).</p>


<BR>
  <p class="indentpara">

  Highly enriched uranium
 is procured, while unfissionable 
  depleted uranium remains as a waste product, both are output in gaseous form.  585,000 metric
tons of depleted uranium are stored in 46,000 cylinders in Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and make 
up 70% of the DOE's "Materials in Storage" category.  The DOE says that a two thirds of this comes from producing 
fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.
<BR>
[note: NYT 02-14-2005 reported "700,000 tons of depleted uranium, still mixed with fluorine and much of
it in decaying metal canisters, in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee"]
  
  This material is conveniently used by the military as a weapon,  which functionally  turns out to actually be a means of
   waste disposal on a widespread international basis.

<BR>

  <p class="indentpara">[Note on Military Use of Depleted Uranium (DU): 
  DU is stored at these sites in gaseous form, but it in metal form, it is one of the densest materials
  known.  It's density and mass form warheads which can penetrate armored vehicles like tanks, but it also burns 
  up on high impact- creating extremely high temperatures and burrowing a hole through the target.  As it burns, the DU turns 
  into a white powder form, which can travel downwind 60 miles in conditions such as Iraq.  Even small particles of 
  depleted uranium are extremely dangerous when inhaled or ingested.  Not only is DU toxic, but is additionally radioactive. 
  Alpha radiation, which it primarily emits, is generally only harmful when the emitting object
   is in contact with our skin or organs.   Thus it is through ingestion or inhalation that DU can enter our bloodstream and 
   become lodged in our bodies, causing cancer.  Meanwhile, many U.S. veterans of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 have 
   acquired "Gulf War Syndrome," and many who posed for photos atop Iraqi tanks covered in white DU powder died within 
   10 years.  The US military actively denies that DU is a chemical weapon or has any toxic characteristics after usage, 
   since it would incriminate them in violating the articles of the Geneva Convention.  Since it does not fission like 
   an H-bomb, it is not termed a nuclear weapon.   
The pentagon's estimate was about 320 tons (640,000 pounds) of DU dropped
during the first war with Iraq (this is a count for just DU, and not the non-DU parts of the missile).  
Much more was used in Kosovo, Iraq, Afganistan, and elsewhere; and the US continues to use it today.]

<B>Oak Ridge Reservation - Tennessee <BR>
Nuclear Components, Uranium Enrichment</b>
<BR>

  <p class="indentpara">
  This site has a dual function: it fabricates various nuclear components for the weapons, but it also houses operations 
  for uranium enrichment.  The K-25 Site, one of many areas at Oak Ridge, was the first site to house
   a gaseous-diffusion plant in 1947.  
Like other uranium enrichment plants that would come online in the early 1950s, 
K-25 stores depleted uranium hexaflouride waste gas onsite, and has about 5,000 of the 10-14 
ton cylinders.  K-25 also has 45 basement vaults intended for the storage of low-level 
radioactive waste and mixed waste, capable of storing some 63,000 drums.

Like at Paducah and Portsmouth, uranium hexafluoride cylinders are also stored near the K-25 Plant, 
each containing 10 to 14 tons.  Some of these units being 50 
years old, ultrasound is used to evaluate the effects of external corrosion on the steel cylinders. Cylinders closest 
to the ground can experience accelerated corrosion.  This hot gas is cooled with freon, and 88% of the USA's ozone 
depleting CFC's originate from leaks from Paducah.  Over the years, enriched nuclear power plant fuel for 
commercial reactors has been all come from the enrichment facilities at Paducah, dispelling the industry's 
myth of "clean air through nuclear power."

 <p class="indentpara">

The Y-12 Site, another well-known facility at Oak Ridge, primarily formed depleted and enriched
uranium metal into components for nuclear weapons and reactors, including fabrication of fuel rods.
 As with the uranium enrichment 
operations at K-25, Y-12's functions are primarily handled by another site, which is Rocky Flats. 
Y-12 also enriched lithium for use in tritium production (lithium must be enriched before 
it can be used as a target in a reactor to produce tritium for nuclear weapons).  Surplus 
lithium deuteride (already enriched) was also recovered and recycled at Y-12.  All of these 
operations at Y-12 took place primarily at the COLEX and ELEX facilities. 
     </p>
<BR>

 <p class="indentpara">
After lithium enrichment stopped 
in 1962, some 35,000 areas were contaminated with mercury and airborne mercury vapor.
Large amounts of mercury are used in this task, and many tons were released at the site 
during these operations.  

 White Oak Creek, which runs through the Oak Ridge site, drains into the Clinch River, carrying with it 
 fission products like strontium-90 and cesium-137, but also hazardous materials like PCBs into the river.
 The DOE constructed a sediment-retention dam, but it wasn't until 1992 (much too late) and only 
 partially effective.  Oak Ridge also operates a radioactive and hazardous waste incinerator [TSCA Incinerator]
which is licensed by the EPA to burn waste at the site.

Before and after photos of Rocky Flats "cleanup." 
Like at many sites, wastewater was often directed into ponds to evaporate, where it contaminated the 
groundwater with toxic chemicals and radionuclides.  Additionally, 
like many sites the DOE have remediated, it's debatable whether much 
remediated at all-  at the cubical pond area above, the existing water was merely treated, drained out, 
and afterward the area was filled and paved over with a giant parking lot.
  The DOE presents this 
as
an example of thier cleanup efforts, but just as in the South Texas mining areas 
groundwater and aquifer pollution was ignored, seen as too costly to consider.
Additionally, they use terms such as "greenfields" to describe remediated areas, where the notorious 
supposedly "impermeable" clay (a phrase used at many nuclear sites)
is used to cap the waste, covered with a bit of topsoil.

Due to the 
plutonium processing capabilities at the site, SRS has been involved in producing Mixed Oxide Fuel (also 
called MOx fuel) for experimental reactors capable of testing this new fuel.  MOx fuel is composed of 
both uranium oxide and plutonium oxide powders.  MOx fuel is frowned upon as a means of dealing with the plutonium 
predicament for two reasons.  Plutonium not only burns hotter and can be more dangerous to use
in reactor fuel,  it also simply produces more waste and plutonium when used in a reactor.  
Another process which instead immobilizes plutonium in a glass form, called vitrification, is favored since it 
has been proven as effective in preventing the proliferation of plutonium.  The process makes the plutonium 
extremely difficult to extract.  
</p>

<BR>

  <p class="indentpara">
SRS has been looking
 into both options- however, on recommendation from the DOE Inspector General,
 vitrification has been shelved to an extent due to the cost involved, 
in favor of unvitrified onsite storage of surplus plutonium.
Onsite waste currently includes approximately 35 million gallons of liquified waste stored in 49 underground tanks.
Ed Lyman, president of the 
Nuclear Control Institute said, "There is no basis at all to conclude that it is safe to dispose of this in
concrete, which is a water-laden solid.  To simply dump it at the
Savannah River Site instead of processing it and disposing of it responsibly is
an outrage."
</p>

<BR>

  <p class="indentpara">
In 2002, a proposal to import 34 metric tons of plutonium from 
Rocky Flats for storage at SRS was underway, which, coupled with the decision to dispose rather than vitrify, 
caused quite a controversy.  
Originally, this waste was to come to SRS for vitrification, so that it could be 
slated for disposal elsewhere.  South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges said, "The Department of 
Energy has broken promises, offered no assurances and left few
options. Once plutonium arrives, it will never leave," Hodges said. "They want South
Carolina to quietly become the nation's plutonium dumping ground."  
</p>

<BR>

  <p class="indentpara">
Hodges proceeded to sue the Energy Department on May 1, saying that 
the government had failed to make a legally binding promise not to store the
plutonium in his state, and he demanded that the two sides get a court order enforcing the promise. Without
an agreement that the promise was enforceable in court, he said he would physically
prevent the Energy Department's trucks from rolling over the state line with State Troopers 
guarding the borders until a federal court ordered him to comply.  He 
 said he would lie in the road himself to keep trucks loaded with
plutonium out of South Carolina.  
"We want to make sure South Carolina has the legal tools available to make sure the government keeps its
 promises," he said, "there will be no plutonium shipments 
 until they do so."  "I order that the transportation of plutonium on South Carolina roads and highways is
prohibited," Hodges said. "I order that any persons transporting plutonium shall not
enter the state of South Carolina."  
In time, a federal judge
 crushed Hodge's case, forcing him to comply- to the disappointment of many who saw hope in this skirmish.

Burlington, however it wasn't long before Pantex assumed all assembly duties.  After the Cold War ended, 
Pantex's mission was switched to dismantling nuclear weapons, although it continued to quietly produce
low-yield nuclear weapons.  Since 1995, Pantex has been designated the primary storage site for 
surplus plutonium in the DOE Complex, thus, both this site and Savannah River are key when 
discussing plutonium in the United States.

Ohio: Fernald Plant: Uranium Refinery, Metal Foundry and Machinery Plants


<BR><BR>

Ohio is home to two major sites in the DOE complex, one is a uranium conversion facility in 
Fernald which has of late become a hot topic in regard to waste arriving to Texas for 
disposal.  This site has leaked into the aquifer below the plant, the ZXXXXXX aquifer.  
Uranium ore arrived at the plant from around the nation and the globe to be
refined into uranium fuel pellets for reactors.  The Mound facility........

  <p class="indentpara">
Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) was the first geological repository in the 
United States for the attempted isolation of radioactive waste from the DOE complex.
It was believed from studies by the National Academy of Sciences in the 1950s that
the salt beds surrounding the waste would shrink and contain the waste onsite.  Many 
critics have pointed out that there is a serious problem with onsite karst, which is
characterized by flowing water between fissures in the geology.  '
It resides below a regional aquifer and there has been much discussion about the risk of 
radionuclides percolating out of the site into a pathway into the Pecos River.
The waste which is sent to WIPP is called "transuranic waste," which refers to 
waste that not only has an atomic number above uranium (thus <i>transuranic</I>) 
but also emits radiation of over 100 millicuries.  As with many other types of radioactive waste for disposal, 
proponents of the site have consistently refered to the contents as being nothing more than contaminated "gloves and booties."
