<B><font color="black">2 Huge Nuclear Waste Dumps For Andrews County - Now Adding a Third?</B></font><BR>
There have been some other important events regarding the 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</A> facility.  A review of what happened during the previous legislature, including more 
background information, is available below.  During the last legislative session, WCS was given the opportunity to apply to host 
two huge nuclear waste dumps at the Andrews County site in Texas.  The state agency responsible for the licensing and oversight of this process 
(the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/permitting/wasteperm/stakeholdergroup/llrw.html">TCEQ</a>) 
has since reviewed WCS's huge application for deficiencies, and responded with three separate notices pointing out shortcomings 
in the application.  The application was finally declared administratively complete February 18, which moves proceedings into 
the Technical Review portion of the process.  A public meeting to
take comments has been set for 7 p.m. March 31 at Andrews High School, Andrews, Texas.

Meanwhile, WCS has been attempting to become licensed for storing and disposing of 11(e)(2) waste yet again.
In order to dispose of this sort of waste, WCS must petition for another license at the TDSHS 
(which licenses both storage and disposal of this material). 
In a proposal similar to one <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="andrews/openrec.html">previously denied in 2001</a>,
WCS seeks permission to both store and dispose of 1.5 million cubic feet of what is refered to as "11(e)(2) byproduct material," which largely 
consists of wastes from 
the pre-enrichment process of converting uranium from milled ore to a gaseous form.  As in the past, the drive to apply for such a license
comes from a formal announcement that a particular facility is seeking a disposal site for its waste.  In this case, the facility is the 
D.O.E.'s Fernald conversion facility near Cincinnati, Ohio- a deal for a $14 million disposal contract.  Another drive toward this sort of 
permitted activity functions to ease becoming a dedicated disposal site to the proposed National Enrichment Facility in Eunice N.M., 
mentioned earlier.

Three leaky concrete silos at Fernald built in the early 1950s contain high-activity "K-65" sludge waste that was originally slated 
to be sent to the Nevada Test Site, until the State of Nevada threatened to sue the Department of Energy.  In November 2003, 
at the request of the Bush administration, reclassification of 
unusually concentrated radium waste (such as the waste in the silos) 
was added to the Senate version of the 2004 Energy and Water Appropriations bill,
allowing burial in a commercial surface landfill as 11(e)(2) waste rather than in a government-owned underground 
disposal site as originally proposed.  International Uranium Corp.'s 
White Mesa mill in Blanding, Utah declined the waste, saying it was "too hot for us to handle."  Lakewood, Colorado-based Cotter Corp. also declined to seek approval.
The company EnviroCare in Utah considered taking the waste up to late 2003, until the State of Utah 
also prohibited its disposal along with Class B and C "low-level" waste.  

<BR><BR>
The primary reason
for this inhibition of dumping this waste at just any site in the nation is that these silos consist of waste from refining pitchblende from the Belgian Congo, which previously contained
much higher concentrations of uranium than found in average ore (40-65% concentration of various uranium isotopes, compared to typical U.S. 2-5% uranium). 
The remaining waste of naturally occurring radionulides is also more concentrated:
 thorium, lead, and polonium isotopes.    Radium releases radon gas as it very slowly decays, with
penetrating gamma rays, and alpha radiation, being a primary concern to
 the Fernald cleanup oversight of the leaking silos.   
 Whereas ordinary ore such as mined in Texas has concentrations of radioactivity near 500 picocuries per gram, 
this ore from the Belgian Congo has been stated to be near 85,000 picocuries per gram.

Fluor Fernald is to recieve a $215 
million performance bonus for completing cleanup by a December 2006 
deadline, and if done six months earlier, the bonus will be an additional $73 million dollars.  This is part of the DOE's 
Accellerated Cleanup program, which has been criticized for encouraging rushed, sloppy cleanup operations with its site remediation contractors.
Fernald's 240,440 cubic feet of silo waste amounts to about 30 million pounds, including 31 tons of uranium, 130 tons of barium, 900 tons of lead, 
almost 3 tons of arsenic in addition to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); a total estimated to amount to more than 6100 curies.

WCS aims to recieve 800 railcars with a total volume of 1.5 million
cubic feet for disposal from the Fernald silos.


<BR><BR>

Fortunately, some Texas legislators are calling for this to not be considered by 
the State agencies, but that the matter should instead be taken under consideration during the 2005 legislative session.  


In October 8 2004, Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock wrote a letter to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS, the new name 
for the Texas Dept. of Health, which licenses both storage and disposal of 11(e)(2) waste) in response to WCS requests 
to have their license amended.  In it he stated, "a decision to accept this quantity and quality of radioactive waste
involves numerous policy decisions that need to be carefully weighed by
the Legislature and all appropriate state agencies ... Accepting this proposal without qualifications assumes an implied 
policy that Texas is willing to serve as the radioactive waste disposal state of first and last resort.  
That decision belongs to the Legislature ... I also respectively request that this proposal be deferred until the 
legislature has an opportunity to review and direct your agency and others with regard to the appropriate public policy, 
safety and financial matters that are associated with this proposal."  

<BR><BR>

October 18 2004, WCS's Kent Hance responded by sending a letter to the same TDSHS official, pressuring that "(Sen. Duncan's) request to delay action on 
the WCS application is unsupported and should be denied ... (his) assertion that the site has not been evaluated technically 
as an appropriate site is not supported by the facts." 
Those familiar with WCS's approach to government officials and representatives should not
be suprised by the tone in the letter.  This behavior is demonstrated repeatedly in WCS's TDSHS file, some of which is available 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="andrews/openrec.html">here</a>.  "We are confident that after a thorough technical review of the applications,
the radiation control experts in your agency will agree the storage and ultimate disposal of the Fernald material at the WCS facility 
is a safe and appropriate proposal."  

<BR><BR>

The TDSHS responded to Sen. Duncan that he would be updated of the status of the applications, and that the 
Technical Review for the 11(e)(2) disposal would not be completed until September 2005.  On January 10 2005, a 
letter quite similar to Sen. Duncan's original was sent to the TDSHS, this time his signature was accompanied by 14 
of his Senate peers.  WCS's Hance managed to shoot off a response to the TDSHS dated the <I>very next day,</I> saying, 
"there is no basis in law to delay the processing," and, "further delay could cause <I>irreparable harm</i> to WCS and
its efforts to develop its business."  Hance also coyly pretends that the Senators' letter addresses only amendments to 
the storage license, "the current amendment application has absolutely nothing in relation to disposal of radioactive waste."
Recall earlier that it was Hance personally who asserted WCS's intentions of "storage and ultimate disposal of the 
Fernald material at the WCS facility," and that the disposal application had already been entered.  
To make everything by the book, on January 12 2005 Senators Duncan and Armbrister submitted to the TDSHS that licensing 
activity on 11(e)(2) waste be held off under a "good cause" exception.



<BR><BR>

The Senate Natural Resources Committee met on February 1 2005 for scheduled testimony on the issue of WCS and
Fernald.  Sen. Duncan presented an update and some background on the issue, followed by representatives from the 
relevant state agencies, WCS, and the Department of Energy.  So far, the discussion appears to focus on the idea 
that the state should receive 
financial compensation, rather than whether to allow the importation of this waste or not.  Duncan 
has suggested that the state should receive at least
10 percent of the gross revenue, plus a surcharge based on a
number of additional factors.

Despite Senate action, on February 23 2005, TDSHS approved WCS's amendment request for the storage of the Fernald waste which increases WCS's 
licensed storage space 5 times- from 250,000 to 1.5 million cubic feet.  
Sen. Duncan has now presented SB1667 which, as introduced, does not prevent the importation of the Fernald waste, yet does some interesting things like 
transfering all  regulatory oversight of processing, storage and disposal of radioactive material, including 11(e)(2), from the TDSHS 
to the TCEQ.  Since WCS has pretty much gotten whatever they ask for from the TDSHS in the past, they are needless to say not to pleased with this,
or other parts of the bill which outline surcharges on the waste.  Duncan also has fixed a part of the Texas Administrative Code he previously criticized regarding 
amendments to licensees like WCS, which states that when an amendment is requested, it takes effect immediately, with a notice posted to the 
public afterward, and public hearing granted only if an "affected person" writes TDSHS within 31 days.  Even though this bill doesn't repair 
the passage of last session's CSSB 1567, it has alot of good stuff in it, and we support alot of what it has in it.  There is currently some 
discussion that there may be a committee substitute for this bill may come out shortly.

<BR><BR>
On February 28 2005, Rep. Pete Gallego
[D-Alpine]  filed a concurrent resolution calling for the creation of a
House-Senate interim committee appointed by the House Speaker and Lieutenant Governor, to study Texas' role in the disposal of
radioactive waste.  It calls for this move in light of several developments since last session, including
the 11(e)(2) waste from Fernald, depleted uranium waste from the LES's proposed National Enrichment Facility, 
and the proposal to import waste from Nebraska and the Central Compact.  These developments contradict the basic idea 
that the Compact would limit waste from non-compact states, and in the case of Fernald and LES, transcend the definition of "Federal Waste"
in last Session's CSSB 1567.  Many good points and a very worthy resolution, but it was not allowed to pass out of Committee.

<BR><BR>
<font color="black">A public hearing was held in Andrews County on March 31, 2005 by TCEQ regarding the Fernald waste.
[<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="WCS_033105PUBHEARING.pdf">click here to view transcript PDF</a>]. 
WCS was granted permission to store this waste, and was also awarded the $7.5 million DOE contract in April.  
The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club had filed a
request for a contested case hearing on the storage amendment to the license, and a hearing in front of an 
administrative judge in Austin is now set for July 11.  Despite this, shipments were  
reported across the nations newspapers to begin arriving at Andrews during the first week on June.

As if there wasn't already enough evidence critical of the TDSHS oversight of radioactive materials in Texas
to necessitate Sen. Duncan's SB1667 bills transfer of responsibility, the federal government
started expressing its own concern about how Texas is handling its Agreement State responsibilities.

At the end of April, the NRC placed the TDSHS on "heightened
oversight" and gave it 30 days to submit an
improvement plan, saying that since August 2001 (when TDSHS 
got the best possible
rating), the department failed to notify the
commission of 37 of 160 reportable incidents
involving radioactive materials until long after
required deadlines, and 22 others needed
additional follow-up information.  
TDSHS officials responded that this was the result of a lack of staffing.
