<B>Site Updates:</b><BR>
<span class="sans13"><I>
This site has basically been put on mothballs since 2006 or so- however- it still serves as the only 
source of an omnibus historical overview of the nuclear history of Texas.  In 2008, Waste Control 
Specialists in Andrews County recieved the license to dump waste that we discuss here, and the uranium 
mining operations have continued to start up again.  Alot of people put alot of work during the 
legislature over the years trying to fight this stuff, which is an uphill battle as the powerful corporate interests have our state in their grasp, influencing lawmakers and the regulatory process.
This site should prove valuable to all who take up the fight, and want to have a solid foundation of the background has they begin to work on these subjects.
Thanks you for using it, and I hope that it functions as one of the most important resources in your toolbox toward promoting safe, renewable, and sustainable 
alternatives to nuclear fuel. <BR>

After the 79th Session of the Texas State Legislature drew to a close, this section was 
restructured to make things easier to read.  The previous layout of all of the latest 
news and issues was on one page, the main topics were been given thier own pages to ease.  
There are more changes to come but may take time.  (I have a day job).
  Things have also been slow on the waste issue, but not on the issues of Andrews County!  
  See the first item below for what I'm talking about.
  <BR><BR>
  
  Also- don't forget that there is now a 2MB text archive of newspaper and media coverage
related to nuclear issues, <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('NewsBits.html')">available here</A>.  
It goes back to the mid-1990s, and usually  lists to the current week.  
Our factsheets in english and spanish are now located at the bottom of this page below the news items.  
Our latest factsheet regarding WCS and LES is available

<B>Even <b>More</b> Sites Proposed in Andrews County- Experimental HTGC Reactor</b><BR>


A high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is proposed by UT System and General Atomics for siting in Andrews to open in 2012.
As if Andrews County wasn't getting nuked enough already.  I haven't summarized in yet, but here are 3 articles about it.
The most recent type of HTGC reactor to be tested is the Pebble Bed Modular reactor, pushed by the commercial reactor operator
Exelon in the US.  The most famous recent PBMR siting attempt has been in South Africa.  The second and third links have info on the 
shortfalls of these technologies.

WCS Fernald Waste Storage Proceeding, SOAH Hearings DONE - State gifts WCS AGAIN</b>
<BR>
On December 16 2005, the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) concluded with a ruling: WCS will
not bear scrutiny  upon this license amendment.  In the ruling my testimony was truncated - 
I discussed Monahans and Monument Draw, the Pecos River as well. 
This was generally ignored from the record by the judge who signed for both judges on the document.  
The only meaningful comment I seemingly had when looking at thier decision was that I said the Colorado was 
"just north" of the facility.  I actually said Monument Draw was to the north and west of the site.  One 
branch goes to the Colorado, the other goes down to Monahan's water supply tank.  
I never thought 
that I would get status of affected person, since I don't fall under the legal definition.  

I did hope that the judges would acknowlegde my main point about the previous ruling WCS mentioned,
(see last paragraph in this block)- and not simply dismiss all contesting testimony.  As in 1997, radiological 
pathways were portrayed as hypothetical scenarios and not taken under 
serious consideration.  Here is some history that I will truncate it later.  

<BR><BR>

Since Sept 1st, SOAH has continued the case of 
whether WCS should have been issued license amendment 32 to expand their storage space to 
1.5 million cubic feet, in order to accommodate the 11(e)(2) waste that has been arriving
from Fernald, Ohio.  WCS is already storing some of this waste as it began 
arriving in early June.  Oddly enough, State law actually tells the Department of State Health 
Services to grant approval prior to any hearing on the issue, which is to
occur 30 days after the amendment has been granted.  The meeting was originally 
scheduled as such on July 11, 2005.  Lawyers from WCS and the major requestor 
for the contested case hearing (Sierra Club) agreed to postpone the meeting due to 
issues regarding the notice for the meeting itself, and on Sept 1st proceedings
were finally underway.  

<BR><BR>

Attempting to set a precedent for the meeting, WCS beforehand presented to the court and all parties 
<a class="redlink" target="_blank" HREF="WCS-SOAH-1997.pdf">a previous SOAH ruling</A>
from  when it became licensed to store radioactive materials.  The 1997 decision 
 dismissed all requests for contesting the licensing based solely upon the testimony 
 of expert testimony that WCS flew in.  At that time, the opposing parties
 were individuals and organizations without resources for presentation or defense 
 by lawyers and experts.  WCS was again attempting to simply quash any critical 
 opposition by getting the Judges to deny anyone the status of "affected person."
 Under the statute, an "affected person" is only eligible if living within the 
 host County (or adjacent), and can demonstrate that "he/she suffered or
will suffer actual injury or economic damage." Once all potential "affected persons" 
are eliminated, the hearings end, and WCS again escapes scrutiny. The previous ruling 
caved in to the standard nuclear industry explanations to dismiss County residents raising 
issues from geology to transportation of waste.  Particularly at question continues the
"will the person suffer injury" issue.  In 1997, radiological 
pathways were portrayed as hypothetical scenarios and not taken under 
serious consideration in the final decision.

<B>The 79th Legislature's Special Sessions and Waste Legislation</b><BR>
Sen. Duncans bill during the Regular Session (SB1667, see below for details) 
was quickly reintroduced for the first Special Session as SB39, and was scheduled for the Senate Committee
on Natural Resources meeting on Monday, June 27th, but then never got further.  For the second Special Session, 
Rep. Bonnen first introduced a House version as HB26 on July 25th.  At first Sen. Duncan unsuccessfully attempted to 
attach the bill to judicial pay-raise legislation, and then finally introduced the bill as SB40 on August 9.
The bill hit the Senate Floor and passed the <I>very same day it was submitted,</I> so in less than 24 hours it 
had been filed, voted, passed, and delivered to the House by morning.
<BR><BR>
Overall, what it does with waste is alright.
Check out the Regular Session summary below for our analysis of this legislation during the Regular Session.  
Unfortunately, the most controversial part of this legislation remains, in the changes it slips into the Water Code
which have more to do with uranium mining than of waste disposal 
[specifically, "Sec. 27.023 Authorization for Area-Wide In-Situ Mining of
Radioactive Substances," Texas Water Code].  
Section 36 of Sen. Duncans bill allows 
companies with permits for injection wells to begin uranium mining without a public 
hearing or any further approval from the State whatsoever.  It even says a 
contested case hearing is forbidden.  I know Sen. Duncan invited uranium mining companies 
from Texas and elsewhere to Austin during the Regular Session, and am pretty sure he 
didn't invite people like the folks from Kleberg County who are being told by the EPA not 
to drink the water due to uranium contamination (see below).  Why is Duncan doing this?  
Is it a gift for companies like URI in Kleberg?  It sure walks and talks like one.
Will he reconsider this prior to the 80th Legislative Session?

<B>The 79th Texas State Legislature: Ideas, but little action</B>
<BR>
This session, there were a number of bills, none of which succeeded in passing, that had to do with 
waste and mining.  Rep. Villareal's HB1656 attempted to address the infamous loophole in the Texas 
Compact law by expressly limiting waste imports to Compact member States.  Rep. Gallegos presented 
HCR85, a concurrent resolution calling for an  interim panel (appointed by the Speaker and Lt. 
Governor)  to study the implications of importing radioactive waste as mandated by the previous 
session, and the issues which have arisen since that order was considered and signed into law.
Both of these bills were not allowed passed thier House Committees to be considered on the House Floor.

<BR><BR>
Sen. Duncan procured SB1667, which would have moved agency supervision of radioactive waste 
processing, storage and disposal all under the TCEQ, and added revenue generation to a 
part of the Texas Code which went somewhat overlooked during the last session regarding 
uranium byproduct, which incidentally WCS has been ramming through to import to thier 
Andrews facility.  This bill was passed the Senate, and then died in the House.  It was a good bill,
although we recommended that the revenue be used ater 
versions of this bill added a provision which limited public participation in uranium mine 
licensing.  Meanwhile, Rep. "Buddy" West's HB2982 (which never made it to the House floor), 
pretty much ignored Sen. Duncan's efforts to consolidate regulation to the TCEQ, and attempted 
to give oversight of uranium mining operations to the non-nuclear Railroad Commission.
There is discussion about a Special Session being announced, so it is possible that 
Sen. Duncan's bill will return then.

<B>Review: The 78th Texas State Legislature: Nuking Texas with Waste Imports</B>
<BR>
 

In 2003, the Texas State Legislature considered a bill which it 
had been presented with in several different forms for many years,
and finally signed it into law.  Just like previous versions, HB1567 (aka SB824)
was largely written by a group of extremely highly paid lobbyists for the waste disposal 
industry, specifically a company in Andrews County called 
<a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('wcsandrews.html')">Waste Control 
Specialists LLC (WCS)</A>.  The company had accomplished this through years 
of pouring millions of dollars in campaign contributions and soft-money
contributions to state legislators.  Sen. Bivins authored the Senate version with Sen. Duncan 
and sponsored the prevailing House version of this bill (incidentally, Pres. Bush has since granted Bivins the role of 
Ambassador to Sweden).  Rep. "Buddy" West authored the House version with Reps Chisum and Smith.

<BR><BR>

This law mandates that rather than merely open a waste dump for 
<a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('texascompact.html')">The Texas Compact</A>,
that a private company (WCS) would be allowed to open the Compact dump and a second huge one 
about 100-times larger for waste from the Department of Energy, which is waste from 
our nations many legacy nuclear weapons factories from the Cold War.  This law has opened the door
for Texas to become "the radioactive waste disposal state of first and last resort."  
(quote from Sen. Duncan regarding later activities during the 79th Legislative Session).
<br><BR>

The DOE dump has been slated to have a capacity of 
281 million cubic feet, and is to open along with the Compact dump in 2008 by the TCEQ's 
current schedule.  Since the Barnwell site in S. Carolina will be closing in 2008, Texas will be 
the only existing dump to take the nations waste.  It also says that when the company closes the dump and leaves with the 
profits, the contaminated site will belong to Texas taxpayers in perpetuity.  
Although it takes billions of dollars to maintain and clean up these sites after closure, 
the company is only required to place a comparatively miniscule amount into a cleanup fund.

<B>Uranium Mining Coming back</B>

<BR>

There was some activity on mining during the 79th Session, but none 
of the bills passed that had been proposed.
Rep. "Buddy" West's bill this Session to deregulate mining by giving oversight to the 
non-nuclear Railroad Commission.  Also mentioned was the committee amendment that got attached 
to Sen. Duncan's mostly-otherwise good bill, an amendment which restricts public participation 
in the licensing process for uranium mines.  Several companies with interests in uranium mining have been 
lobbying this session, primarily encouraged by the Bush Administration's renewed nuclear energy program,
its push for opening new plants (as well as grandfathering old ones), and the fuel that will be required 
to power these plants. Opponents of further mining have refered to the long well-documented history and
legacy pollution of uranium mining in Texas, in the 18 counties in which these activities have occurred.

<BR>
<BR>

In October 2004, residents of rural Kleberg County near Kingsville
were notified by the EPA that uranium and radiation levels as high as eight
times the federal safety standards had been detected in the water wells, and to not drink the water.  
The mining company URI is currently attempting to reopen two sites 
and start a new injection well in the county, and claiming the area pollution as naturally present.
Hearings on the issue are to continue through early August.

<B>National Uranium Enrichment Facility = Waste to WCS</B><BR>
For some time, Louisiana Energy Services (LES) has been pushing to become licensed to operate the new 
National Enrichment Facility right accross the border from WCS.  Along with this site would be a "deconversion" plant
to prepare the waste for disposal.  So far, the Texas dump has been assumed to take the waste from the facility for 
disposal, and now it appears LES is considering placing the deconversion facility in Texas as well, probably at the 
WCS site.  Due to all of the changes since last session, 
such as LES and Nebraska's waste, Rep. Gallego filed a resolution calling for a joint committee to study 
these issues and report to the next legislative session in 2007, but it did not pass this Session.

<B>The Texas Compact</B><BR>
On February 28 2005, 
Rep. Mike Villarreal [D-San Antonio] submitted House Bill 1656, which attempted to add a requirement that Texas 
radioactive waste disposal be limited to the compact member State of Vermont.  This bill did not pass.  
Last year, Nebraska began seriously 
considering sending waste to Texas from the States in the Central Compact (Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, 
and Nebraska).  This proposal is still on the table, and Nebraska now has an additional incentive: relief on paying 
$11 million in its settlement if it can get Texas to take the waste.  Now at the end of the Session, 
other states are now attempting to send rubble from decommissioned power plants to WCS as "exempted 
waste" to go into their HazMat hole in the ground.

<B>WCS and 11(e)(2) Waste from Fernald, Ohio</B><BR>
In 2003, the Dept. of Energy's Fernald Plant began looking for a disposal site for 3 silos of uranium tailings 
which are categorized under Section 11(e)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act.  Two of these silos contain unusually 
radioactive wastes that are as hot as Class C waste.  For this reason, other sites in the US have declined to 
accept the waste, but WCS sure didn't.  WCS applied to both extend its storage license and obtain a license for a 
third dump for this type of material.  Texas Senators have asked for consideration of any 11(e)(2) licensing to
be postponed until after they have investigated the implications of the issue.  All the while, WCS
 protested- not only pretending that there is no application to dispose being processed, but saying delay in 
 granting their 
 licensing aims has "no basis in law" and  "could cause irreparable harm to WCS."  Traditional  
 behavior from WCS exhibited yet again.  WCS got TDSHS to give them their license amendment anyway,
 Sen. Duncan submitted a bill (SB1667) that had some promising ideas, including transferring
regulatory authority over processing and storing radioactive waste from the historically lax TDSHS over to the TCEQ. 
The bill did not make it through the session.  Beginning in June 2005, shipments began.   
The Sierra Club had filed a contested case hearing which has now finally been scheduled for July 11, 2005
(the law in this area only
allows for public participation <i>after granting the company's licensing request</I>... a little, well, wierd.  
Sen Duncan's bill would have corrected this).  There is information at the top of this page regarding the 
hearing and its location.

<B><font color="black">Nuclear Weapons and Texas [Pantex, Los Alamos, and more]</B></font><BR>
There has been a campaign to address Los Alamos National Labs as
UT System has been considering a very expensive bid to manage the DOE lab, where the first nuclear weapons were developed and where nuclear
weapons research and production continues to this day.  It could be said that this is a conflict of interest, as plutonium runoff from
Los Alamos has polluted the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers for decades since the 1940's, pollution that has increased as much as a 
hundredfold after the fires several years ago.  It now appears that the bid for Los Alamos may be fading, but another bid is arriving
with Sandia.
 You can find out more about this material by visiting 
<a class="redlink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.utnukefree.org">UTNukeFree.org</A>.  We also want to congratulate students 
in the group <a class="redlink" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.utwatch.org">UTWatch</A> for taking on the nuclear subject.  

<BR><BR>
For some time, Texas has been home to the primary nuclear weapons factory in
the United States, which assembles all of the U.S. stockpile out of the parts 
sent from the other factories (final assembly).  Since the end of the Cold War, 
the site called <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('pantex.html')">Pantex</A> has instead decommissioned some older nuclear weapons 
and currently stores over 60 tons of plutonium onsite from these activities.  
In the 1990s, low-yield bunker-buster nukes started being manufactured at 
<a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('pantex.html')">Pantex</A>, and with the latest Bush Administration, new plans are to revitalize the 
U.S. stockpile of thermonuclear weapons, placing <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('pantex.html')">Pantex</A> back into production mode as during the Cold War.
This is not the end though- <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('pantex.html">Pantex</A> is seen as a prime location for placing a new 
"Modern Pit Facility," which would manufacture plutonium pits, taking over the previous role 
of Rocky Flats, one of the most polluted sites of the weapons complex (a plutonium pit is the fissionable core of thermonuclear warheads) .   
The <a class="redlink" HREF="javascript:openit('wipp.html')">WIPP</A> site in New Mexico is also a candidate for housing the Modern Pit Facility.
