<span class="text13">Version 2.0 - Over 7,300 defined terms and acronyms!</span><BR>

<DD><B>How to use this dictionary:</B>
<BR>

Sources for the definitions is found in square brackets [ ].  This glossary was made from 8 glossaries from DOE
publications, two EPA glossaries, 2 TNRCC glossaries, an IEER glossary, and finally, 2 listings found at the NRC's website.
 Additions were then made using 10 other 
glossaries from other sources found on the internet.  IMPORTANT- Some definitions have an addition with the label 
"TAC &sect; 401.003 - Texas Health and Safety Code."  This definition is the authoritative legal definition of that particular term in the State of Texas.
<B>New definitions added during and after the 78th Regular Session of the Texas State Legislature will be added when time permits.</B>

<BR>
<BR>
Some definitions appear in the form of "reactor, pressurized" or alternately, "pressurized reactor."  In instances that both forms were found in glossaries I used, 
an attempt was made to merge them into one single defining term, so that there would be no duplication.
Due to the multiple origins of the definitions, and the limited manpower on the project, there are sure to be items which were not merged, or which 
utilized either one form opposed to the other.  If you are unable to find a multiple word term in the dictionary, please check to see if 
the other form is used to verify that the term you seek to define is here.  Better yet, use Ctrl-F (Cmd-F on Apple Computers), to enter a term to 
find on the page. 
<BR><BR>

One word on acronyms and such- these are often found in separated documents from the definitions themselves, and were previously neglected in 
the process for this reason.   I just added (Oct 2003) over 6000 acronyms from the NRC's NUREG-0544, which is dedicated to acronyms.  
These are at the top of each alphabetical category.  There are previously existing other acronyms mixed in with the definitions which will be later consolidated 
so that all acronyms will be grouped, listed at the beginning of the alphabetical category.  This will happen when time permits since there 
are between five and ten concurrent ongoing projects being worked on at one time here.

<DD><I><B>Origin codes found in square brackets:</B></I><BR>
Some origin code are missing from a few of the definitions, these were either formulated in priori or were simply 
missed in the mechanical work of accumulation.

<b>Arms Control:  </B> Arms control, a term popularized in the early 1960s, refers to the voluntary limitation or reduction of weapons and their means of delivery, between and among countries, through negotiation. It is distinct from disarmament, which seeks to eliminate, also by international agreement, the means by which countries wage war. While arms control compiled a mixed record during the post-World War II era, revolutionary changes in international politics during the early 1990sÇmost especially the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold WarÇhave opened up promising new opportunities for radical reductions in the nuclear and conventional weapons arsenals of the major powers.

<B>Assured Isolation: </B> An integrated management system for isolating waste, while preserving
options for its long-term management, through (a) robust, accessible facilities, (b) planned,
preventive maintenance, and (c) sureties adequate to address contingencies or implement future
alternatives.[DOE/LLW-250a]  
<BR><BR>
The following definition is given as the "concise definition" in the text of the TNRCC's Texas Compact Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Generation Trends and Management Alternatives Study, and is considered the most authoritative definition specific to Texas:
<BR>
"Assured Isolation of LLRW means managing LLRW in an isolation system that uses waste
form characteristics; above ground facility design features; active monitoring and
maintenance activities; facility operating procedures; natural site characteristics; and
institutional controls to inhibit the release of radioactive constituents from LLRW so that
concentrations of these materials entering the accessible environment will remain within
prescribed limits. Assured Isolation also means preserving the ability to retrieve the
managed LLRW for subsequent use, processing, or management; managing LLRW with
reliance on engineered features, ongoing active maintenance, and natural site characteristics;
not precluding the ability to license the facility for LLRW disposal in the future with
consideration of existing site-specific data and information; and providing financial
assurances necessary to accomplish all activities associated with such LLRW management,
including ultimate disposal."  [TNRCC]
<BR><BR>



<B>Assured Isolation, Cases for AI Evaluation:</b>
<DD><I>Retrieve and Dispose (Case 1):</I>  Case defined to assist in evaluating
the AI concept as a LLRW management alternative; involves an AI facility
developed with the intent to isolate LLRW for hundreds of years and then retrieve
it for final disposition at some other facility. 

<DD><I>Convert to Disposal (Case 2):</I>  Case defined to assist in evaluating the
AI concept as a LLRW management alternative; involves an AI facility developed
with the intent to isolate LLRW for hundreds of years and then license it for
LLRW disposal in compliance with all LLRW disposal licensing requirements at that
time.  [TNRCC]

<B>Atomic Energy Act (AEA) : </b>  The federal law that established a program for 
government control of the possession, use or production
of atomic energy and special nuclear material, including highly enriched uranium.
[DOE/EA-1172].   The act was passed in 1946, was amended
substantially in 1954 and several times since then.  This Act created the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC). The AEC later split into the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) and the Energy and Research and Development Administration (ERDA). ERDA
then became part of the Deparment of Energy in 1977. This act is the basis of
authority for NRC, DOE, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in regulating
radioactive materials defined in the AEA. NARM is not defined under this act and
is therefore  not subject to its requirements.   [EPA-MW and DOE/EM-0319] <BR><BR>

<B>Atomic Energy Commission (AEC):</b>	A five-member commission established by The
Atomic Energy Act to supervise nuclear weapons design, development, manufacture,
maintenance, modification, and dismantlement.[DOE/EA-1172]  The AEC was created by the United
States Congress in 1946 as the civilian agency responsible for the production of
nuclear weapons. The AEC also researched and regulated atomic energy. When broken up in 1974,
 its weapons production and research activities were given to the Energy Research and
Development Administration(ERDA), while its regulatory responsibilities were given
to the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  ERDA's functions were later transferred
to the Department of Energy. (DOE).

<b>Atomic Mass Unit:  </B> A relative mass unit based on the atomic weight of carbon 12, which is taken to be 12; the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.008 amu. The atomic mass unit (amu) is 1.660 <SUP>-27</SUP> kg.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Atomic number (symbolized Z): </B>  The atomic number of an element, 
which indicates its place in the periodic table of elements, 
is the number of protons (positively charged particles) in the
 nucleus of one of its atoms. If an atom is electrically neutral,
  the same number of electrons are present. Atomic number is often
   symbolized with the letter Z and is shown as a numerical subscript
    to the left of its chemical symbol. For example, the letter C 
    preceded by a superscript number 12 and a subscript number 6 
    indicates a carbon atom of atomic mass 12 and atomic number 6,
     the difference being equal to the number of neutrons present in the nucleus.
[ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Atomic weight (atomic mass) : </B>  The nominal atomic weight of an  isotope is given by the
sum of the number of neutrons and protons in  each nucleus. The exact atomic
weight differs fractionally from that  whole number, because neutrons are
slightly heavier than protons and  the mass of the nucleus is also affected by
the binding energy.      [IEER]  As
a basis of reference, the atomic weight of the common isotope of carbon
(carbon-12) is taken to be exactly 12; the atomic weight of hydrogen (the
lightest element) is then 1.008.  Hence, the atomic weight of any element is
approximately the mass of an atom of that element relative to the mass of a
hydrogen atom.

  (2) The tailings or wastes produced by
the extraction or concentration of uranium or thorium from ore processed
primarily for its source material content, including discrete surface wastes
resulting from uranium solution extraction processes. Underground ore bodies
depleted by these solution extraction operations do not constitute "by-product

of abandoned and uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.   [DOE/EM-0266] Provides the
legal authority for emergency response and cleanup of hazardous substances
released into the environment and for the cleanup of inactive waste sites. 
[DOE/EM-0466]  Under the Superfund program, EPA has the authority to clean up the
nation's worst hazardous waste sites using money from a trust fund supported
primarily from a tax on chemical feedstocks used by manufacturers. Companies or
individuals responsible for the wastes are identified by EPA, if possible, and
made to pay for the cleanups.  The 1986 amendments included provisions that
require DOE and other federal agencies to clean up their facilities under Federal
Facility agreements with EPA.    [DOE/EM-0319] The Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 reauthorized CERCLA to continue cleanup
activities around the country. Several site-specific amendments, definitions,

<B>Deactivation:</b>   Activities that ensure surplus facilities are secure in a safe and stable 
condition pending their ultimate disposition. Includes eliminating immediate
safety and environmental hazards as well as removing most contaminants within the facility.
    [DOE/EM-0319]   "The deactivation process places a facility in a safe and stable condition that
minimizes the long-term cost of a surveillance and maintenance program and is protective of
workers, the public, and the environment until decommissioning is complete. Actions include
the removal of fuel, draining and/or de-energizing of nonessential systems, removal of stored
radioactive and hazardous materials, and related actions."  [DOE D&amp;D Resource
Manual" (DOE/EM-0246)]   <BR><BR>  

<B>Decay chain, radioactive:</b> A series of nuclides in
which each member decays to the next member of the
chain through radioactive decay until a stable nuclide
has been formed.<BR><BR>

<B>decay correction: </B>  The amount by which the calculated 
 radioactivity (for example, of a release of radioisotopes) must be reduced 
 after a period of time, to allow for its radioactive decay during that 
 time.     [IEER]  <BR><BR> 
 
<B>Decay (radioactive):</b>	Spontaneous disintegration of the nucleus of an unstable atom, resulting in the emission of particles and energy.   [DOE/EM-0266]
The decrease in the amount of any radioactive material with the passage of time, due to the spontaneous emission from the atomic
 nuclei of either alpha or beta particles, often accompanied by gamma radiation.  [TDHBRC]  
The transition of a nucleus from one energy state to a lower one, usually involving the
emission of a photon, electron, neutron, or alpha particle. [DOE-IDB97]<BR><BR>

<B>Decommissioning:</b>   Decontamination  and dismantlement of retired,
contaminated facilities and removal and/or  disposal of the resulting wastes.    
[IEER]  Retirement of a nuclear facility, including decontamination 
and/ or dismantlement.    [DOE/EM-0466]  "Decommissioning takes place after deactivation and includes surveillance
and maintenance, decontamination, and/or dismantlement. These actions are taken at the end of
the life of a facility to retire it from service with adequate regard for the health and safety of
workers and the public and protection of the environment. The ultimate goal of
decommissioning is unrestricted release or restricted use of the site."  - DOE D&amp;D
Resource Manual" [DOE/EM-0246].   

<BR><BR>

<B>Decommissioning waste:</B>  Waste (generally LLRW) generated in the decommissioning of a facility   [TNRCC]   <BR><BR>

 <B>decon: </B> A method of decommissioning in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safety
 buried in a low-level radioactive waste landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits the property to be released for unrestricted use shortly after cessation of
 operations. [NRC]  
 One of three decommissioning options established by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. Decon is immediate decontamination and dismantlement, the
option selected for the Haddam Neck Plant. The other two options are Safestor
and Entomb. Safestor is putting a nuclear power plant into a safe condition and
delaying decontamination and dismantlement activities for as long as 60   years.
Entomb is encasing in a structurally long-lived substance, <I>e.g. </I>concrete,
with future dismantlement option.  [CY]<BR><BR>

<B>Decontamination:</b>	   Removal of radioactive or hazardous contamination by a chemical or mechanical process.    [DOE/EM-0466] 
The reduction or removal of contaminating radioactive material from a structure, area, object, or person. Decontamination may be 
accomplished by:  1) Treating the surface to remove or decrease the contamination, 
 2) Letting the material stand so that the radioactivity is decreased as a result of natural decay, 
 3) Covering the contamination to shield or attenuate the radiation emitted.  [TDHBRC]
  Activities taken to remove unwanted
(typically radioactive) material from facilities, soils, or equipment by washing, chemical action, mechanical
cleaning, or other (treatment) techniques.  [DOE-IDB97].  It should be noted that some have considered decontamination 
itself as being a form of contamination, since the materials are moved to an uncontaminated area and pollute the environment 
at that new location.  This alludes to both new waste disposal sites yet also techniques such as surface irrigation of radioactive 
wastewater at mining sites.

<B>Decrement Level Funding:  </b>One of the three funding levels used in the development of the ADS  by the Office of Environmental Management (EM).  The decrement level funding is established annually as a percentage of the target level at the program level by the operations/field offices.  Funding at the decrement level meets activities and projects of the highest priority. [DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>


<B>Deep-bed plant:</b>  A boiling-water reactor facility using
a demineralizer vessel for water purification which
contains an ion-exchange resin that is 3 ft or more deep. [DOE-IDB97]

<B>Defense-in-depth:  </b> 
 A design and operational philosophy with regard to nuclear facilities that calls for multiple layers of protection to prevent and mitigate accidents. It includes the
 use of controls, multiple physical barriers to prevent release of radiation, redundant and diverse key safety functions, and emergency response measures. [NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>Defense-generated waste: </b> Waste resulting from weapons research and development, the operation
 of naval reactors, the production of weapons material, the reprocessing of defense spent fuel, the dismantling of nuclear
 weapons, and the decommissioning of nuclear-powered ships and submarines  [NSCEHC].<BR><BR>

Natural uranium is composed  of three isotopes:  uranium-238 (99.284
percent); uranium-235 (0.711  percent); and uranium-234 (0.005 percent), all of
which are radioactive.  The purpose of uranium enrichment is to concentrate
uranium-235, the  fissile isotope, in one stream. The other stream which is low
in uranium-235,  is called "depleted uranium," which contains about 0.2 to 0.3
percent  uranium-235.     [IEER]  The U-238 radionuclide is also commonly refered to as depleted uranium.
<BR>
Uranium that, through the process of enrichment, has
been stripped of most of the uranium-235 it once contained, so that it has more
uranium-238 than natural uranium. It is used in some parts of nuclear weapons and
as a raw material for plutonium production.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>



<B>Derived air concentration (DAC): </b>

 radioactive waste later.  The term does not include emissions and discharges under department rules.
 [<I>TAC &sect; 401.003 - Texas Health and Safety Code</i>]   <BR><BR>


<B>Disposal Facilities:</b>   DOE Order 435.1 defines a disposal facility as the land, structures, and
equipment used for disposal of waste. A disposal site is the portion of a disposal facility that is
used to dispose of waste. For LLW, it consists of a disposal unit and a buffer zone. A disposal
unit is the discrete portion (e.g., a pit, trench, tumulus, vault, or bunker) of the disposal site into
which waste is placed for disposal (Source:   DOE Order 435.1). The Department has stipulated
that waste management disposal facilities at only three sites (Hanford Site and Nevada Test Site)
accept waste from offsite generators. CERCLA disposal facilities are designed and constructed
to manage LLW/MLLW generated by onsite remediation activities only.    [DOELLWRpt]   <BR><BR>  

<B>Disposal Ready Volume Projections:</b>   LLW and MLLW are generated by a number of
Department of Energy programs and disposed by waste operations and CERCLA disposal
facilities, as well as commercial facilities. LLW and MLLW volume projections vary depending
on the point in time at which they were reported. Projection data are available for a number of
different volumes, from initial LLW generated from a remediation response to contaminated
media to volumes transferred for treatment to volumes transferred for disposal. In general, data
on treatment were not available. The projections reported in this Report represent the waste
volumes requiring disposal in engineered facilities. Volume projections transferred by any
generator to the Environmental Management program for treatment and/or disposal represent the
volumes at the time of transfer to the Environmental Management program. As certain types of
treatment, such as compaction or incineration, may significantly reduce volumes for final
disposal, these volumetric projections may overstate required disposal capacities. Moreover,
employing aggressive waste minimization techniques may further reduce the volume projections. [DOELLWRpt]<BR><BR>

<B>Disposal in CERCLA Facilities:</b>   This disposition category consists primarily of disposal in the
existing, approved, and planned CERCLA disposal facilities. Appendix A contains a detailed
discussion of the existing, approved, and planned CERCLA disposal facilities. Note that these
disposal facilities will accept only onsite remediation LLW or MLLW.    [DOELLWRpt]   <BR><BR>  

<B>Disposition:</b>	 Reuse, recycling, sale, transfer, storage, treatment, or disposal.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Disposition to be Determined:</b>   Some sites did not report a final disposition remediation strategy
for specific elements. Examples include collection and treatment or collection and storage (the
Report did not consider these remediation strategies as final disposition types) where no
additional responses were provided by the sites. Other sites did not have sufficient data to
provide an initial volume of contaminated media. Finally, some sites dispositioned only fractions
of certain elements. In all these instances, the Report segregated these elements into the
"disposition to be determined" category.    [DOELLWRpt]   <BR><BR>

<B>Dose:</b>	 A specific amount of ionizing radiation or a toxic substance absorbed by a living being.    [DOE/EM-0319]  

 The absorbed dose, given in rads (or the international system of units, grays), that represents the energy absorbed from the radiation in a gram of any material.
 Furthermore, the biological dose or dose equivalent, given in rem or sieverts, is a measure of the biological damage to living tissue from the radiation exposure. [NRC]
 <BR><BR>

<B>Dose equivalent:</b>  (also called biological dose) The product of the absorbed dose in rad and the effect of this type of radiation
in tissue and a quality factor. Dose equivalent is expressed in units of rem or Sievert, where 1 rem
equals 0.01 Sievert. The dose equivalent to an organ, tissue or whole body will be that received
from the direct exposure plus 50-year committed dose equivalent received from radionuclides taken
into the body during the year.
 [DOE/EA-1172]  A measure of the biological damage
to living tissue from radiation exposure. It takes into account the type of radiation and the
absorbed dose. For example when considering beta, xray, and gamma ray radiation, the
equivalent dose (expressed in rem) is equal to the absorbed dose (expressed in rads). For
alpha radiation, the equivalent dose is assumed to be 20 times the absorbed dose. It is
expressed numerically in rem.  [EPALLRW]

<b>E = mc<sup>2</sup>:  </b>Albert Einstein's equation E = mc<sup>2</sup> is the most famous in the history of science. It states that energy and mass are equivalent, a concept that enabled scientists to understand the energy source of the sun and other stars and led to the development of nuclear energy. Specifically, the equation states that a mass m can theoretically be transformed into an amount of energy, E, equal to m multiplied by the square of the speed of light (3 X 10 to the 10th power cm/sec). Einstein deduced this concept from his theory of special relativity. The equation first appeared in a paper he published in 1907.  [ATARC]  See " Mass-energy equation"<BR><BR>

<b>Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP):  </b>A sharp pulse of radio-frequency
(long wavelength) radiation produced when an explosion occurs in an
asymmetrical environment, especially at or near the earth's surface or
at high altitudes. The intense electric and magnetic fields can damage
unprotected electrical and electronic equipment over a large area. It is
now thought that a single high-altitude blast over the U. S. could
seriously disrupt the nation's communications system, and perhaps shut
down the entire power grid. At present, however, there is no known way
of providing complete protection against the effect.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<b>Gadget, The:  </B> The Gadget was built to test the implosion design. It was placed atop a 100 foot tower and detonated at 5:29:45 am on July 15, 1945.  
It had a yield of 19 kilotons.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Gamma rays/ radiation:</b>	High-energy, short wavelength, electromagnetic radiation emitted from the nucleus in the radioactive decay of many radionuclides.
 [DOE/EM-0266]   Waves of gamma rays can ionize atoms and split 
 chemical bonds.  Gamma radiation frequently accompanies alpha and beta emissions and
 always accompanies fission. Gamma rays are very penetrating and are best stopped or shielded by dense materials, such as lead or depleted uranium.  [NRC]
 Gamma rays are similar to X-rays, the latter term being 
 applied usually to electromagnetic waves generated by electron accelerators, 
 as for instance in medical equipment.     [IEER]  <BR><BR> 
 
 
 <B>Gap:  </b> The space inside a reactor fuel rod that exists between the fuel pellet and the fuel rod cladding.  [NRC] <BR><BR>
 
 
<B>Gas centrifuge:</b>	 A uranium enrichment process using a large number of
rotating cylinders in a series. The lighter uranium-235 isotope concentrates at
the center of a spinning centrifuge of gaseous uranium hexafluoride. This method
produced the first gram quantities of enriched uranium in 1944.    [DOE/EM-0319] 
<BR><BR>


<B>Gaseous diffusion:</b>	 A uranium enrichment process based on the
difference in rates at which uranium isotopes in the form of gaseous uranium
hexafluoride diffuse through a porous barrier. This process is used to enrich
uranium in the United States. The full scale K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was
completed and operational at Oak Ridge, Tennessee in August 1945. Two additional,
currently operating, gaseous diffusion plants previously used by AEC and DOE for
weapons production are located at Paducah, Kentucky and Piketon, Ohio.   
[DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs):</b>  Gaseous diffusion is the process used in the United States to
enrich uranium so that it can be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. Two DOE-owned uranium
gaseous diffusion plants are leased to and operated by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation.
 [DOE/EA-1172]  A facility where uranium hexafluoride gas is filtered, uranium-235 is
separated from uranium-238, increasing the percentage of uranium-235
from 1 to about 3 percent. The process requires enormous amounts of
electric power. [NRC]   Although nuclear power has been touted as a
"clean" energy alternative to combat global warming, the truth is that uranium enrichment is one of the most CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive
industrial operations on earth. The uranium enrichment plant in Kentucky
is the nation's single largest emitter of banned chorloflourocarbons.

<B>GC/MS:  </b>  Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer

<BR><BR>

<B>Geiger-Mueller counter</b> A radiation detection and measuring instrument. This
instrument consists of a gas-filled tube containing electrodes, between which there is an
electrical voltage but no current flowing. When ionizing radiation passes through the
tube, a short, intense pulse of current passes from the negative electrode to the positive
electrode and is measured or counted. The number of pulses per second measures the
intensity of the radiation field. It is sometimes referred to as simply a Geiger counter.  [EPALLRW, NRC]
It was named for Hans Geiger and W. Mueller, who
invented it in the 1920s. It is sometimes called simply a Geiger counter
or a G-M counter, and is the most commonly used portable radiation
instrument.
<BR><BR>

<B>General Plant Projects (GPP):  </b>Miscellaneous small construction projects that each have a total estimated cost of  less than $2 million and cannot be specifically identified in advance of the fiscal year, although "representative" lists of projects are offered during budget formulation.

<B>Generator:</b>
              A cow -a system containing a parent-daughter set of radioisotopes in which the parent decays through a daughter to a
              stable isotope. The daughter is a different element from that of the parent, and, hence, can be separated from the parent
              by elution (milking). [LBNL]<BR><BR>


<B>generator sites: </b> DOE facilities across the United States that currently store, or will soon generate,
 transuranic waste destined for disposal at the WIPP.  [NSCEHC]<BR><BR>

beneath the earth's surface.    [DOE/EM-0319]   A mined facility for disposal of radioactive
waste that uses waste packages and the natural geology as barriers to provide
waste isolation.    [DOE/EM-0466]   A facility that has an excavated
subsurface system for the permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level waste.  [DOE-IDB97]<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

<B>Glovebox:</b>	A sealed box used to handle some radioactive materials with gloves attached to the wall. Often filled with an inert gas and fitted with a filtered ventilation system.   [DOE/EM-0266]
<BR><BR>

<B>Graded Approach :  </b>The depth of detail required and the magnitude of resources expended for a particular management element to be tailored to be commensurate with the element's relative importance to safety, environmental compliance, safeguards and security, programmatic importance, magnitude of the hazard, financial impact, and/or other facility-specific requirements. [DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>

<B>Graphite reactor:</b>	 A nuclear reactor using graphite blocks surrounding
the nuclear fuel to slow the neutrons to low energy so that a self-sustaining
chain reaction is achieved. The first nuclear reactors built near Chicago,
Illinois; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington were graphite reactors.  
 [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

Commission limits for Class C low-level radioactive
waste, as defined in 10 CFR Part 61.55. [DOE-IDB97]
<BR><BR>

<B>Graphite:  </b>  A form of carbon, similar to the lead used in pencils, used as a moderator in some nuclear reactors. [NRC] <BR><BR>


<B>gray (Gy): </B>  A unit of absorbed radiation dose expressed in terms of absorbed energy per unit mass of tissue, equal  to 100 rads.

<B>Halite:</b> A mineral composed of sodium chloride, NaCl. [WIPPEA]<BR><BR>


 
<B>Half-Life : </b>  The half-life of a radioactive material is the time it takes
for half of the material to radiate energetic particles and rays and transform to
new materials. For example, the half-life of cesium (Cs-137) is 30 years after
which time half of it decays to a non-radioactive stable nuclide, barium
(Ba-137). If you start with 100 Kg of Cs-137 then after 30 years you will have 50
Kg of Cs-137 remaining. After 30 more years you will have 25 Kg of Cs-137
remaining and so on.  (After one half-life, half the radioactive atoms 
in a sample remain radioactive; after two, one quarter; after three, one-eighth; etc) [EPA-MW, NSCEHC]

<BR>

The time it takes for one-half of any given number of unstable atoms to decay and 
disintegrate into another nuclear form.  Each isotope has its own characteristic half life. 
They range from millionths of a second to
  billions of years. A general "rule of thumb" in health physics is that the hazardous period for 
  a given isotope is 10 half-lives.   [DOE/EM-0266, DOE/EM-0466]  Also called physical or radiological halflife. [NRC]
<BR><BR>


<B>Halflife, biological</b>  The time required for the body to eliminate one half of the material taken in by natural biological means. [NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>Halflife, effective:</b>  The time required for a radionuclide contained in a biological system, such as a human or an animal, to reduce its activity by one-half as a combined result of

used in the Savannah River Site production reactors.   [DOE/EM-0266]<BR>
Deuterium oxide, D<sub>2</sub>O. Water in which the hydrogen is replaced by "heavy
hydrogen" or deuterium. Because of the very low neutron absorption
cross-section of deuterium, heavy water makes an excellent moderator and is used
in e.g. CANDU (Canadian Deuterium Uranium Reactor) and SGHWR (Steam Generator
Heavy Water Reactor) nuclear reactors. It is present in ordinary water at part
in about 5000.  [AT]
<BR><BR>
Water containing significantly more than the natural proportions (one in
6,500) of heavy hydrogen (deuterium, D) atoms to ordinary hydrogen
atoms. Heavy water is used as a moderator in some reactors because it
slows down neutrons effectively and also has a low probability of
absorption of neutrons. [NRC]

 wastes have been converted. HLW is primarily in the form of spent fuel discharged from commercial nuclear power reactors. It also includes some reprocessed
 HLW from defense activities, and a small quantity of reprocessed commercial HLW (see 10 CFR Part 60). [NRC]
<BR>

The radioactive waste material that
results from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid waste
produced directly from reprocessing and any solid waste derived from the liquid
that contains a combination of transuranic and fission
product nuclides in quantities that require permanent isolation. HLW is also a
mixed waste because it has highly corrosive components or has organics or heavy
metals that are regulated under RCRA. HLW may include other highly
radioactive material that NRC, consistent with existing law, determines by rule
requires permanent isolation.   [EPA-MW]

<B>Initial Financial Plan:  </b>The first allocation of budget authority for the applicable fiscal year.[DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>


<b>Initial Nuclear Radiation:  </B> Nuclear radiation (essentially neutrons and gamma rays) emitted from the fireball and the cloud column during the first minute after a nuclear explosion.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Initiator:</b>	 A device that produces a timed burst of neutrons to
initiate a fission chain reaction in a nuclear weapon. Initiators made of
polonium-210 and beryllium were located at the center of the fissile cores of
early atomic weapons.    [DOE/EM-0319]  The initiator  produces neutrons at
just the right instant, when the assembly process has reached the stage
at which the fissile material has supercritical mass. This allows some
of the early stages in the chain reaction to be bypassed. As the
protective shell collapses, the alpha particles combine with the
beryllium powder to form huge amounts of neutrons for the chain
reaction. [ATARC]<BR><BR>


<B>Installation:  </b>The laboratory, production plant, or other-geographically distinct site where the unit of work is principally performed or managed. [DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>

<b>Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM):  </B> A ballistic missile with a range of 3,400 miles or more.

[ATARC]<BR><BR>


<B>Institutional Controls:</b>	   Non-engineering measures usually, but not
always, legal controls— intended to affect human activities in such a way as to
prevent or reduce exposure to hazardous substances. Institutional controls
include, but are not necessarily limited to: land and resource (e.g., water) use
and deed restrictions; well-drilling prohibitions, building permits and well use
advisories and deed notices; other legally enforceable measures. However, they
are distinct
from physical engineering measures such as treatment and containment systems.   
[DOE/EM-0466] <BR><BR>

<B>Institutional waste:</b> Commercial low-level waste
resulting from bioresearch, medical, and certain
nonbioresearch sources. Bioresearch wastes include
wastes from animal studies at universities. Medical
wastes include those generated from diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures on humans at hospitals.
Nonbioresearch wastes include research reactor wastes;
small-volume, sealed radiation sources; and accelerator
targets. [DOE-IDB97]

<B>internal radiation dose: </B>  The dose to organs of  the body from
radioactive materials inside the body. It may consist  of any combination of
alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.     [IEER]  <BR><BR> 


<B>ion</B> - Atomic particle, atom or chemical radical bearing an electric
charge, either negative or positive. [CY]  An atom that has lost or gained one or more orbital electrons, thus becoming electrically charged.  [AT]  
An atom that has too many or too few electrons, causing it to have an electrical charge, and therefore, be chemically active; or, 
2) An electron that is not associated (in orbit) with a nucleus.  [TDHBRC]

 <BR><BR>



<B>Ion exchange resins:</b>	 Synthetic material used to selectively remove
dissolved contaminants such as heavy metals or radionuclides from water by
replacing or exchanging them with other constituents. Resins are typically used
in beads or cartridges of beads or powders through which water is pumped.   
[DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Ionization Chamber</b>
A device for measuring the intensity of ionizing radiation. The radiation ionizes the gas in the chamber and the rate at which ions are collected (on
oppositely-charged electrodes) is measured as an electric current.  [AT]<BR><BR>

<B>ionize: </B>  To split off one or more electons from  an atom, thus leaving it
with a positive electric charge. The electrons  usually attach to other atoms or
molecules giving them a negative charge.      [IEER]  <BR><BR> 

<B>Ionizing radiation:</b>	Radiation that is capable of breaking apart molecules or atoms. The splitting or decay of unstable atoms typically 
emits ionizing radiation.   [DOE/EM-0266]  Any radiation capable of displacing electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby producing ions. Some examples are alpha, beta, gamma,
 X-rays, neutrons. High doses of ionizing radiation may produce severe skin or tissue damage.  [TDHBRC]   Electromagnetic radiation (gamma or X-ray)
or particulate radiation (alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons,
etc.) capable of producing ions, i.e., electrically charged particles,
directly or indirectly, in its passage through matter.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>IPABS: </b>   Integrated Planning, Accountability, and Budgeting System    [DOELLWRpt]   <BR><BR>  

 <B>Iron Fence: </B> The most-restricted alternative case for
land use. It is characterized by containing, rather than actively
remediating, contaminated sites. This means that soil and buried
waste sites would be capped, ground-water contamination would
be controlled from spreading by hydraulic controls and barriers,
and facilities would be entombed.
[DOELL]<BR><BR>

<B>Irradiate:</b>	To expose to ionizing radiation, usually in a nuclear reactor. Targets are irradiated to produce isotopes.   [DOE/EM-0266]

              different nuclear energy states. [LBNL]<BR><BR>

<B>Isometric transition: </b>
              A mode of radioactive decay where a nucleus goes from a higher to a lower energy state. The mass number and the
              atomic number are unchanged. [LBNL]<BR><BR>

<B>Isotopes:</b>	 Atoms of the same chemical element that differ only by the
number of neutrons in their nucleus.  Any of two or more variations of an element in which the
nuclei have the same number of protons (i.e., the same atomic number) but
different numbers of neutrons so that their atomic masses and weights differ.  (A useful working definition is "atoms that are the same outside but different inside").  
Isotopes of a
single element possess almost identical chemical properties, but often different
physical properties (e.g., carbon-12 and 13 are stable, carbon-14 is
radioactive).  Most elements have more than one naturally
occurring isotope. Many more isotopes have been produced in nuclear reactors and
accelerators.  [DOE/EM-0466, DOE/EM-0319, IEER, AT]   
<BR><BR>

<B>Isotope separation (enrichment):</b>	 The process of separating different
isotopes of the same element. The three elements that have been isotopically
enriched in large quantities for use in nuclear weapons production are uranium,
lithium, and hydrogen.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Isolation:</B>  Not defined in Texas statues or rule; in the context of high
level
radioactive waste disposal, isolation means "inhibiting the [environmental]
transport of radioactive material so that amounts and concentrations of
this material entering the accessible environment will be kept within
prescribed limits."   [TNRCC]   <BR><BR>

contains radioactivity and is not classified as high-level waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel,
or 11e(2) byproduct material (as defined in section 11e(2) of the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended), or naturally occurring radioactive material. Test specimens of fissionable
material irradiated for research and development only, and not for the production of power
or plutonium, may be classified as low-level waste, provided the concentration of transuranic
is less than 100 nanocuries per gram.  [DOELLWRpt, DOE/EM-0466]

<dd>LLRW is waste that satisfies
the definition of LLRW in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1985. The LLRWPAA defines LLRW as "radioactive material that (A) is not
high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material as
defined in section 11e.2 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954) and;(B) the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, consistent with existing law and in accordance with
paragraph (A), classifies as low-level radioactive waste." In a sense, LLRW is
defined by what it is not and consequently is the most broad category of waste.
It encompasses materials that are slightly above natural radiation background
levels to highly radioactive materials which require extreme caution when
handling (Greater than Class C : GTCC).   [EPA-MW] <BR><BR>

<DD> Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) is a general term for a wide range of wastes. Industries, hospitals and medical, educational, or research institutions; private or
 government laboratories; and nuclear fuel cycle facilities (e.g., nuclear power reactors and fuel fabrication plants) using radioactive materials generate low-level
 wastes as part of their normal operations. These wastes are generated in many physical and chemical forms and levels of contamination (see 10 CFR Part 61).  [NRC] 
<br><br>
<DD>
Texas Dept of Health Bureau of Radiation Control states a very misleading definition that "most are generally short-lived and have low radioactivity."
This definition is untrue.  The LLRW classification has absolutely nothing to do with the degree of radioactivity or the length of halflife.  Additionally, over 90% of LLW that is generated
 is from nuclear power plants, and includes nearly everything except for spent fuel and the reactors themselves.

<B>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA):</b>	   NEPA is the basic
national charter for protection of the environment.   Enacted in 1970, that requires the Federal government to consider 
the environmental impacts of, and alternatives to, major proposed actions in its decisionmaking processes.

It establishes policy, sets
goals (in Section 101), and provides means (in Section 102) for carrying out the
policy. Section 102(2) contains "action-forcing" provisions to ensure that
Federal agencies follow the letter and spirit of the Act. 
For major Federal
actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, Section
102(2)(C) of NEPA requires Federal agencies to prepare a detailed statement that
includes an environmental impact statement for proposed action and other specified
information.    [DOE/EM-0466]  Its main purpose is to provide environmental information to decision makers so that
their actions are based on an understanding of the potential environmental consequences of a
proposed action and its reasonable alternatives.

<B>Naturally Occuring or Accelerator Produced Radioactive Materials (NARM) : </b>  Radioactive materials not covered under the AEA that are naturally occurring or produced by an accelerator. Accerlerators are used in sub-atomic particle physics research. These materials have been traditionally regulated by States. A subset of NARM is NORM. NARM waste with more than 2 nCi/g of 226Ra or equivalent is commonly referred to as discrete NARM waste; below this threshold, the waste is referred to as diffuse NARM waste. NARM waste is not covered under the AEA, not a form of LLW, and is not regulated by NRC.   [EPA-MW] <BR><BR>

<B>Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) : </b>  NORM is a
subset of NARM and refers to materials not covered under the AEA whose
radioactivity has been enhanced (radionuclide concentrations are either
increased or redistributed where they are more likely to cause exposure
to man) usually by mineral extraction or processing activities. Examples
are exploration and production wastes from the oil and natural gas
industry and phosphate slag piles from the phosphate mining industry.  
This term is not used to describe or discuss the natural radioactivity
of rocks and soils, or background radiation, but instead refers to
materials whose radioactivity is technologically enhanced by
controllable practices.  Sometimes it is referred to as TENORM. [EPA-MW, EPALLRW] <BR><BR>

<B>Net summer capability:  </b> The steady hourly output that generating equipment is expected to supply to system load exclusive of auxiliary power, as demonstrated by tests at the time of
 summer peak demand. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Neutrino: </b>
 An electrically neutral particle with negligible mass. It is produced in many nuclear reactions such as in beta decay. [LBNL] <BR><BR>

<B>Neutron:</b>	 An elementary, uncharged particle slightly heavier than a proton that comprises part of an atomic nucleus.  Neutrons are required to initiate the fission process,
 and large numbers of neutrons are produced by both fission and fusion reactions.

Together with protons, neutrons form the nuclei of all atoms. Being neutral, a neutron can approach a nucleus without being deflected by
the positive electric field, so it can take part in many types of nuclear interaction. In isolation neutrons are radioactive, decaying with a
half-life of about 12 minutes by beta emission into a proton.  [AT]  
 Uranium and plutonium atoms fission when they absorb neutrons. The chain reactions that make nuclear reactors and weapons work
 thus depend on neutrons. Man-made elements can be manufactured by bombarding other elements with neutrons in production 
 reactors.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Neutron activation:</b> The process of irradiating a
material with neutrons so that the material itself is
transformed into a radioactive nuclide.<BR><BR>

<b>Neutron Bomb:  </B>The neutron bomb differs from standard nuclear weapons
insofar as its primary lethal effects come from the radiation damage caused by
the neutrons it emits. It is also known as an enhanced-radiation weapon (ERW).
The augmented radiation effects mean that blast and heat effects are reduced so
that physical structures, including houses  and industrial installations, are
less affected. Because neutron radiation effects drop off very rapidly with
distance, there is a sharper distinction between areas of high lethality and
areas with minimal radiation doses.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Neutron capture: </b> The process in which an atomic nucleus absorbs or captures a neutron. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Neutron chain reaction: </b> A process in which some of the neutrons released in one fission event cause other fissions to occur. There are three types of chain reactions: (1) Nonsustaining
 chain reaction--An average of less than one fission is produced by the neutrons released by each previous fission (reactor subcriticality). (2) Sustaining chain
 reaction--An average of exactly one fission is produced by the neutrons released by each previous fission (reactor criticality). (3) Multiplying chain
 reaction--An average of more than one fission is produced by the neutrons released by precious fission (reactor supercriticality). [NRC]<BR><BR>


<B>Neutron flux: </b> 

 A measure of the intensity of neutron radiation in neutrons/cm2-sec. It is the number of neutrons passing through 1 square centimeter of a given target in 1
 second. Expressed as nv, where n = the number of neutrons per cubic centimeter and v = their velocity in centimeters per second. [NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>Neutron Generator:</b>	 Device resembling a particle accelerator
that produces a timed burst of neutrons to initiate a fission chain
reaction in a nuclear weapon. Neutron generators located outside the
fissile pit supplanted initiators.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Neutron generation:  </b>The release, thermalization, and absorption of fission neutrons by a fissile material and the fission of that material producing a second generation of neutrons. In
 a typical nuclear power reactor system, there are about 40,000 generations of neutrons every second. [NRC]<BR><BR>


<B>Neutron leakage:</b> Neutrons that escape from the vicinity of the fissionable material in a reactor core. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause
 fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessel for that purpose. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<b>Neutron Radiation:  </B>In fission bombs the neutrons are produced in the fission process. They are emitted from the highly excited fission products. The way that neutrons interact with matter is quite different from the way that gamma rays interact. Neutrons have negligible interaction with atomic electrons. Their only direct interaction is with nuclei. Neutron interaction in the human body can produce ionizing radiation and subsequent doses of radiation.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Neutron source: </b> A radioactive material (decays by neutron emission) that can be inserted into a reactor to ensure that a sufficient quantity of neutrons are available to register on
 neutron detection equipment for power level indication. [NRC]<BR><BR>


<B>Neutron yield</b>
The average numbers of fission neutrons emitted per fission. Usually per thermal neutron absorbed in Uranium-235. [AT]
<BR><BR>

<B>Neutron, thermal:</b>  A neutron that has (by collision with other particles) reached an energy state equal to that of its surroundings, typically on the order of 0.025 eV (electron volts).  [NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>No Further Action:</b>   After consulting with stakeholders and regulatory agencies (whether the
Environmental Protection Agency, other Federal agencies, or State and local agencies), the
Office of Environmental Management may determine that no further action is appropriate. Sites
reported a number of elements that have been determined as or are forecasted to require no
further action.    [DOELLWRpt]   <BR><BR>

 and their associated piping systems. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Nuclear force:</b>  A powerful short-ranged attractive force that holds together the particles inside an atomic nucleus. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<b>Nuclear Freeze Movement:  </B>The nuclear freeze movement advocates an agreement between the United States and the USSR to halt (freeze) the production and deployment of nuclear weapons and delivery systems. First formulated in 1980 by Randall Forsberg, director of the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies in Brookline, Mass., the freeze proposal attracted growing support in the United States during the next two years, when the administration of President Reagan was increasing military spending and preparing to deploy more nuclear missiles in Europe. A series of antinuclear protests culminated in a vast demonstration by nearly half a million people from the United States and other countries in New York City on June 12, 1982.  [ATARC]<BR><BR>


 <B>Nuclear Material and Facility Stabilization: </B> An Environmental Management subprogram
that manages the transfer to Environmental Management of the responsibilities
and facilities that formerly belonged to the nuclear weapons program.
Several sites already have been transferred to Environmental Management
for deactivation and subsequent cleanup. As other sites are transferred
to Environmental Management, the existing resources (funding and
personnel) also will be transferred to Environmental Management.

<B>Nuclear reactor:</b>	
              A device in which a fission chain reaction can be initiated, maintained, and controlled. Its essential components are
              fissionable fuel, moderator, shielding, control rods, and coolant. [LBNL] (see Reactor) <BR><BR>



<B>Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC):</b>	 An independent agency of the
Federal government created by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which
abolished AEC and transferred its regulatory function to the NRC. Specifically,
the NRC is responsible for ensuring that activities associated with the operation
of nuclear power plants and fuel cycle plants, and medical, industrial, and
research applications, are carried out with adequate protection of the public
health and safety, the environment, and national security . Responsible for regulation of commercial nuclear power reactors; nonpower
research, test, and training reactors; fuel cycle facilities; medical, academic,
and industrial uses of nuclear materials; and the transport, storage, and
disposal of nuclear materials as waste.      
<BR>

At full complement,
the NRC has five Commissioners nominated by the President and confirmed by the
Senate; the President designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman. NRC
regulates all commercial AEA materials. Except in a few cases, NRC does not
regulate DOE. NRC does not regulate NARM.  [DOE/EM-0319, EPA-MW]<BR><BR>

<B>Nuclear Safety (NS):  </b>A safety and health (S&amp;H) functional area that includes all those activities that involve radioactive or fissionable materials in such form that a nuclear hazard potentially exists to the employees or the general public. [DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>

<B>Nuclear steam supply system:  </b>The reactor and the reactor coolant pumps (and steam generators for a pressurized water reactor) and associated piping in a nuclear power plant used to generate the steam needed to drive the turbine generator unit.  [NRC] <BR><BR>


<B>Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA):</b>	 Public Law 97-425. The federal law
that provides for the development of geologic repositories for disposal of
high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel and establishes a program of research,
development, and demonstration regarding disposal of high-level waste and spent
nuclear fuel.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>

<B>Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act:</b>  Title IV, Subtitle A of P.L. 100-203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.  Prior to this Act,
the DOE was required to select three candidate
sites for the first national high-level waste repository.  Under the amendments, the only candidate site
DOE may consider for a permanent high-level waste repository is at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. They also 
authorized construction of a monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility to store spent fuel and prepare it for
delivery to the repository.  Dry cast interim storage at Skull Valley, Utah was later proposed in 1996.  [DOE/EM-0466]<BR><BR>


<B>Nuclear Weapons Complex:</b>	   The chain of foundries, uranium enrichment plants, reactors, chemical 
separation plants, factories, laboratories, assembly plants, and test sites that produced nuclear weapons. 
Sixteen major U.S facilities in 12 states formed the nuclear weapons complex.    [DOE/EM-0466] <BR><BR>

<B>Plutonium: </B>  A highly toxic, heavy, radioactive  metallic element with the
atomic number 94, pure plutonium is a silvery
metal that is heavier than lead..  A manmade fissile element, it is produced artificially by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Plutonium has 15 isotopes with atomic masses ranging from 232 to 246 and half
lives from 20 minutes to 76 million years.  Only five are produced in significant
quantities: plutonium-238, -239, -240,  -241, and -242. Plutonium-239 is
the most important plutonium isotope  as it is fissile and is used in nuclear
weapons and some reactors. One  the other hand, plutonium-240 is unsuitable for
use in nuclear weapons  and reactor fuel. Thus, in a reactor whose main purpose
is plutonium  production, the rate at which plutonium-240 is formed controls the
length  of time fuel is allowed to remain under irradiation. Plutonium is
categorized  according to plutonium-240 content, as follows super-grade 
has 2-3% Pu-240; weapons-grade has less than 7% Pu-240; fuel-grade  has 7-18% (or
sometimes given as 7-19%) Pu-240; and reactor-grade  has 18% or greater (or 19% or
greater) Pu-240.   Despite what the  name implies, "reactor-grade"
plutonium has been used successfully to  make a nuclear bomb.  Material rich in the plutonium-239 isotope is
preferred for manufacturing nuclear weapons, although any plutonium can be used. 
Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,000 years.   [IEER, DOE/EM-0342]

<B>QA/QC:</B>  Quality Assurance/Quality Control   [TNRCC]   <BR><BR>


<B>Quality factor: </b> The factor by which the absorbed dose (rad or gray) is to be multiplied to obtain a quantity that expresses, on a common scale for all ionizing radiation, the
 biological damage (rem or sievert) to an exposed individual. It is used because some types of radiation, such as alpha particles, are more biologically damaging
 internally than other types. [NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>Quantum theory: </b>The concept that energy is radiated intermittently in units of definite magnitude, called quanta, and absorbed in a like manner.[NRC] <BR><BR>

<B>RA:  </b>  Remedial Action
<BR><BR>

<B>Rad (Radiation Absorbed Dose) : </b>  One rad is defined as the absorption of 100 ergs per gram of material.  It amounts to 
 approximately one ionization per cubic micron, equivalent to 0.01 joules per kg.    [IEER, AT]
The rad is a unit used to measure a quantity called absorbed dose.  It refers to the amount, or dose, of ionizing
 radiation actually absorbed by any material, including human tissue.  
 The unit is being replaced by the SI unit, the Gray (Gy), equal to 100
rads. 

 [DOE/EA-1172, EPA-MW, AT] <BR><BR>

<B>Radiac:  </b>An acronym derived from "radioactivity detection, indication, and computation." It is a generic term.  [TDHBRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Radiation : </b>  Particles or waves from atomic or nuclear processes.  Ionizing radiation, which is
capable of breaking up atoms or molecules, is comprised of highly energetic and
penetrating x-rays and gamma rays and lesser penetrating particles. Beta
particles are simply energetic electrons and alpha particles are helium nuclei
both arising from the nucleus of a decaying atom. The alpha particle is the
easiest of these radiations to stop and the gamma rays are the most difficult to
shield against. A piece of paper can stop an alpha particle, but it may take as
much as many inches of lead shielding to stop most of the x- rays or gamma rays
in a beam. Depending on the dose, kind of radiation, and observed endpoint, the
biological effects of radiation can differ widely. Ionizing radiation has been
proven to cause cancer at high doses and is assumed to cause cancer and other
deleterious health effects at low doses.   The splitting, or decay, of unstable
atoms emits ionizing radiation.[EPA-MW, DOE/EM-0266] <BR><BR>

<B>Radiation chemistry</b>
The study of influence of radiation on chemical properties and reactions, and its applications. See Radiochemistry. [AT] <BR><BR>

<B>Radiation Protection (RP):  </b>A safety and health (S&amp;H) functional area that includes all those activities that are intended to control exposure of workers and the public to radioactivity. [DOEEMGMT] <BR><BR>

 
<B>Radiation sickness (syndrome)</b>
The acute non-stochastic effects caused by a large dose of radiation to the whole body, such as might be received in a reactor accident
or from a nuclear weapon explosion or its fall-out. The symptoms and their outcome vary with dose size, ranging from temporary nausea
to death. [AT]<BR>
The complex of symptoms characterizing the disease known as radiation injury, resulting from excessive exposure (greater than 200 rads or 2 gray) of the
 whole body (or large part) to ionizing radiation. The earliest of these symptoms are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be followed by loss of
 hair (epilation), hemorrhage, inflammation of the mouth and throat, and general loss of energy. In severe cases, where the radiation exposure has been
 approximately 1,000 rad (10 gray) or more, death may occur within two to four weeks. Those who survive 6 weeks after the receipt of a single large dose of
 radiation to the whole body may generally be expected to recover. [NRC]
 <BR><BR>

<B>Radiation Standards:  </b>Exposure standards, permissible concentration, rules for safe handling, regulations for transportation, regulations for industrial control of
 radiation, and control of radioactive material by legislative means.  [TDHBRC] <BR><BR>

<B>Radiation
 Warning Symbol:  </b> An officially prescribed symbol (a magenta or black trefoil) on a yellow background that must be displayed where certain quantities of
 radioactive materials are present or where certain doses of radiation could be received. [TDHBRC]  <BR><BR>

<B>Radioactive: </b>	Of, caused by, or exhibiting radioactivity.    [DOE/EM-0466] <BR><BR>

<b>Radioactive Cloud:  </b>An all-inclusive term for the cloud of hot gases,
smoke, dust, and other particulate matter from the weapon itself and from the
environment. It is carried aloft in conjunction with the rising fireball
produced by the detonation of a nuclear weapon.
[ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Radioactive contamination:  </B> Deposition of radioactive material in any place where it
may harm persons, equipment, or the environment. [EPALLRW] <BR><BR>

<B>Radioactive dating:</b> 
              A technique for estimating the age of an object by measuring the amounts of various radioisotopes in it. [LBNL]
<BR><BR>
<B>Radioactive equilibrium</b>
In a decay chain if the half-life of a daughter product is much shorter than that of its parent, the daughter is continuously replaced by the
decay of the parent. So, unless it is separated out and measured independently, the daughter appears to decay with the same half-life as
the parent.[AT]  <BR><BR>

<B>Radioactivity: </B>  The spontaneous emission of radiation from the nucleus of an atom. 
Radionuclides lose particles and energy through the process of radioactive decay. [DOE/EM-0466]
  This is usually 
in the form of beta or alpha radiation,  together with gamma radiation. Beta or alpha emission results 
in transformation  of the atom into a different element, changing the atomic number by  +1 or -2 respectively.     [IEER]  
The property possessed by certain
nuclides of spontaneously emitting alpha or beta
particles and, sometimes, gamma radiation by the
disintegration of atomic nuclei. The units for the rate of
decay of radioactive nuclides are the curie, Ci
(3.7 x 10<sup>10</sup> disintegrations per second exactly), or, in SI
units, the becquerel, Bq (1 disintegration per second).  [DOE-IDB97]
<BR><BR>

<B>Texas Compact:</b>  The Texas Compact is an agreement between the states of Maine, Texas and Vermont regarding the disposal of commercial low-level radioactive waste. As a
compact, these States require only one disposal facility for the compact region (rather than one in each State) and have the authority to deny out-of-compact
wastes access to regional disposal facilities.  (However, a 1993 Alabama Supreme Court ruling found that radioactive waste legally counts as resource in interstate commerce.
  In the case a disposal site is privately owned, the site may not deny recieving waste from any party under the commerce and supremacy clauses of the US Constitution, 
  nullifying an guarantee the compact makes in this instance).
    The formation of each Compact requires the approval of the federal government through Congressional consent
legislation. Thus far ten Compacts have received the approval of Congress. The Texas Compact has been approved by all three party states and has received
Congressional approval.  States of Maine and Vermont each contribute $25 million to the State of Texas, in exchange for 50 years of
access to the proposed Texas low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. Maine and Vermont benefit under this arrangement by being ensured access to a
low-level radioactive waste disposal facility, avoiding a far more expensive in-state siting process. <BR><BR>

<b>Vela Satellites:  </B> Vela was a series of 12 satellites developed for the U.S. Defense Advanced Projects Agency to detect nuclear detonations in the Earth's atmosphere. The satellites were launched (1963-70) in pairs from a single vehicle and placed 180 degrees apart, in circular orbits of about 111,000 km (69,000 mi) altitude.  
On Sept. 22, 1979, a Vela reported a brilliant flash between Africa and Antarctica. Some analysts have suggested the possibility of a clandestine nuclear test by South Africa or some other country; the satellite may have been hit by a micrometeoroid, however.

<B>Very high radiation area:</b>  An area in which radiation levels exceed 500 rad (5 gray) in one hour at 1 meter from the source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates (see 10 CFR
 20.1003). [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Viability assessment:  </b> A Department of Energy decision making process to judge the prospects for geologic disposal of high-level radioactive wastes at Yucca Mountain based on (1)
 specific design work on the critical elements of the repository and waste package, (2) a total system performance assessment that will describe the probable
 behavior of the repository, (3) a plan and cost estimate for the work required to complete a license application, and (4) an estimate of the costs to construct and
 operate the repository (see 10 CFR Part 60). [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Vicinity properties:</b>	 Locations away from inactive mill sites where uranium mill tailings were used for construction or were transported by wind or water erosion.    [DOE/EM-0319]  <BR><BR>


<B>Vitrification:</b>	 A process that stabilizes nuclear waste by mixing it
with molten glass. 
This process does not reduce radioactivity. Waste is transformed from a liquid
or sludge into an immobile solid that traps radionuclides and prevents waste from
contaminating soil, groundwater, and surface water. The glass mixture is poured into cylindrical metal canisters,
where it hardens into logs. The DOE will use
borosilicate glass to immobilize its high level radioactive waste.
Plants for vitrifying high-level waste have been
built in the United States at West Valley, New York, and the Savannah River Site,
South Carolina.    [DOE/EM-0319, DOE/EM-0466]  The conversion of high-level waste
materials into a glassy or noncrystalline solid for
subsequent disposal. [DOE-IDB97]
<BR><BR>

The process of converting materials
into a glass-like substance, typically through a thermal process. Radionuclides
and other inorganics are chemically bonded in the glass matrix. Consequently
vitrified materials generally perform very well in leach tests. EPA has
specified, under the land disposal restrictions, vitrification to be the
treatment technology for high-level waste (55 FR 22627, June 1, 1990).   [EPA-MW]

 <B>Void coefficient of reactivity: </b> The change in reactivity per percent change in void content due to an increase in the neutron leakage as the density of the moderator decreases with
 an increasing void content. [NRC]<BR><BR>

<B>Volume reduction:  </B> A variety of techniques that reduce the overall disposal volume of
low-level waste. Volume reduction uses technologies, including incineration, com-paction
or supercompaction, size reduction, and evaporation or concentration.  [EPALLRW]<BR><BR>

The rapid but temporary "poisoning" of a reactor by the build-up of Xenon-135 from the radioactive decay of the fission product
Iodine-135. Xenon-135 is a strong absorber of neutrons and until it (and its parent) have largely decayed away, reactor start-up can be
difficult.  [AT] <BR><BR>

<B>X-rays</b>
Electromagnetic radiation's having wavelengths much shorter (i.e. energy much higher) than those of visible light. X-rays with clearly
defined energies are produced by atomic orbital electron transitions, and are akin to gamma-rays but usually of lower energy. X-rays
produced by the interaction of high energy electrons with matter have a continuous energy spectrum, and it is these that are generally
used in medical X-ray machines.  In nuclear reactions, it is customary to refer to photons originating in the nucleus as x-rays.  [AT]    
Penetrating electromagnetic radiation (photon) having a wavelength that is much shorter than that of visible light. These rays are usually
 produced by excitation of the electron field around certain nuclei. In nuclear reactions, it is customary to refer to photons originating in
 the nucleus as gamma rays, and to those originating in the electron field of the atom as X-rays. These rays are sometimes called
 roentgen rays after their discoverer, W.K. Roentgen. [TDHBRC]

<B>X-ray Fluorescence</b>
An element may be identified and measured by the characteristic discrete X-rays emitted when it is irradiated by radiation of a slightly
higher energy. The effect, due to transitions in the energy status of the orbital electrons, forms the basis of a useful analytical technique.  [AT] <BR><BR>

<B>Y-12:</b>	A plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, built for the Manhattan Project to enrich uranium using calutrons. Today, this plant produces and stores components made of enriched and depleted   [DOE/EM-0266]
<BR><BR>

<B>Yellowcake:</b>	 Uranium is sent from the uranium mill to the refinery in this form.  Yellowcake is the product of the uranium extraction (milling) process; early production methods resulted in a bright yellow compound, hence the name
 yellowcake. The material is a mixture of uranium oxides that can vary in proportion and in color from yellow to orange to dark green (blackish) depending at
 which temperature the material was dried (level of hydration and impurities). The higher drying temperatures produce a darker, less soluble material. Yellowcake
 is commonly referred to as U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> and is assayed as pounds U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> equivalent. This fine powder is packaged in drums and sent to a conversion plant that
 produces uranium hexafluoride (UF<SUB>6</SUB>) as the next step in the manufacture of nuclear fuel.   
  This uranium oxide concentrate results
from milling (concentrating) uranium ore and typically
contains 80 to 90 wt % U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>.

<B>yield: </B>  Measurement of the energy released by a nuclear explosion.     [IEER]   The total effective energy released, usually expressed in
 terms of the equivalent tonnage of TNT required to produce the same energy release.[ATARC]<BR><BR>

<B>Yucca Mountain : </b>  A site on, and adjacent to, the Nevada Test Site that
is being examined to determine whether it is suitable for use as a geologic
repository for the DOE's High Level Waste, Spent
Nuclear Fuel, and possibly for waste that is defined as Greater-than-Class-C
(GTCC). A key element of permanent disposal is that it must be able to isolate
highly radioactive waste for thousands of years because its radioactivity can
harm people and the environment. According to
the 1992 Energy Policy Act, EPA is to set generally applicable standards based
upon public health and safety standards and be consistent with the findings and
recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences for the protection of the
public from releases from radioactive materials stored or disposed of in the
repository at the Yucca Mountain site.    [EPA-MW]
