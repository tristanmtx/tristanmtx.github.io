<B>Waste Types and Classifications</b>
<BR>
<table border=1><TR><td><img src="drums.jpg"></td></tr></table></center>

<BR><BR>

<p class="indentpara">In the United States, it is the process from which the 
 waste was produced, and not the characteristics or radioactivity of the waste itself, 
 which determines the waste's classification.  This is the fundamental problem with radioactive waste 
 classification in the United States.  Radioactive waste is divided into 5 legal 
categories for classification purposes:

</p><BR>




 <p class="indentpara"><b>The Five Waste Types:</b></p>
<BR>

<B>High-level Waste (HLW)</b> 

<p class="indentpara">Primarily composed of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF), but also waste 
produced while reprocessing this reactor byproduct.
<BR>
Spent fuel is made up of fuel rods that have been withdrawn from a reactor after undergoing fission. 
Fuel rods last from 1-3 years before being "spent."
Reprocessing waste is generated by
chemical reprocessing of SNF and irradiated targets, including liquid
waste produced directly from reprocessing and any solid waste derived from the
liquid that contains a combination of transuranic and fission product nuclides
in quantities that require permanent isolation. 

High-level waste contains highly concentrated radioactive fission products, 
hazardous chemicals, and toxic heavy metals. 
It is also a mixed waste because it has highly corrosive
components or has organics or heavy metals that are regulated under RCRA.
It is usually found in the form of a liquid, a solid saltcake, a
sludge, or a dry powdery calcine.  HLW is primarily in the form of spent fuel
discharged from commercial nuclear power reactors.  The DOE's plans are to ship HLW to 
the geologic repository at Yucca Mountain.  Interim storage is also planned in 
Skull Valley, Utah by a consortium of 8 
utility companies named Private Fuel Storage.
</p>

<BR>

<b>Transuranic Waste (TRU)</B>

<p class="indentpara">
The TRU classification is used almost exclusively by the DOE.  Waste 
generated outside of DOE facilities which meets the definition of TRU is generally 
classified as LLW in either the "Class C" or 
"Greater than Class-C"  categories.  The reason for this is that the NRC categories of LLW
had not yet been implemented or developed when the DOE required an intermediate level of waste, 
which were not high-level waste, or what they had defined as low-level waste at the time.
Thus, the "low-level" waste category may consist of waste which qualifies as TRU waste under DOE rules,
but TRU waste must always meet the exact definition to be called transuranic waste.
</p> <BR>
 
<p class="indentpara">Transuranic waste is not 
simply made up of materials that appear after uranium on the periodic table, as the name implies.
TRU waste contains more than 100 nanocuries (3700 becquerels) of alpha-emitting
transuranic isotopes, with half-lives greater than twenty years, per gram of
waste, except for (1) high-level radioactive waste; (2) wastes that the
Secretary of Energy has determined, with the concurrence of the EPA,
 do not need the degree of isolation
required by EPA's high level waste rule (40 CFR 191); or (3) has approved for
disposal on a case-by-case basis in accordance with NRC's radioactive land
disposal regulation. TRU is mainly produced from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel,
reactor fuel assembly, and the use of plutonium to fabricate nuclear weapons.
TRU waste is categorized as either Contact Handled (CH) or Remote Handled (RH).
RH-TRU is any  transuranic waste with a surface dose rate of 200 millirem per hour or greater,
and CH-TRU is any TRU waste with levels which are lower.

DOE is currently
proceeding with plans for TRU waste disposal at the geologic repository called
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.
</p>


<BR>


<B>"Low-Level" Waste (LLW or LLRW)</B>


<p class="indentpara">A catch-all category of waste defined by U.S. law as all wastes that
are not in other categories.  DOE Order 435.1 defines low-level waste as waste that contains radioactivity and is
not classified as high-level waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or 11(e)(2) byproduct material (as defined
in section 11(e)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended), or naturally occurring radioactive material. Test
specimens of fissionable material irradiated for research and development only, and not for the production of power
or plutonium, may be classified as low-level waste.  If the material 
originated from a DOE facility, the transuranic material should be less radioactive than
100 nanocuries per gram and have a halflife of less than 20 years to be LLW. </P>

<BR>

<p class="indentpara">Radioactivity of the "low-level" waste category varies widely and includes both short- and 
long-lived isotopes.  It encompasses materials that are slightly radioactive trash (such as mops, gloves, and booties) 
to <B>highly</b>
radioactive materials which require extreme caution and handling by remote control, 
yet do not meet the exact definition of high-level
 waste, such as control rods from the core of a reactor which regulate and stop nuclear reactions.  
 <B>The "low-level"
classification has absolutely nothing to do with the degree of radioactivity or the length of halflife.</b> 
Additionally, over 90% of LLW that is generated is from nuclear power plants, and
includes everything except the spent fuel. </p>

<BR>

<p class="indentpara">"Low-level" waste is defined by what it is not and consequently is the most broad category of waste. 
In fact, it was been said that LLW as a bulk category contains more radioactivity than high-level waste, because the
amount of material by it's sheer volume has a greater amount of radioactivity in curies.
Industries, hospitals and medical, educational, or research institutions; private or government laboratories; and 
nuclear fuel cycle facilities 
(e.g., nuclear power
reactors and fuel fabrication plants) using radioactive materials generate "low-level" wastes as part of their
 normal operations.  These wastes are generated in many physical and chemical forms and levels of contamination.
</p>

<BR>

 LLW has four subcategories: Classes A, B, C, and Greater-Than Class-C
(GTCC), described below. <BR>
On average, Class A is the least radioactive while GTCC
is the most radioactive.

<BR>
Sec. 2021b. - Definitions <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (9) Low-level radioactive waste<BR>
The term ''low-level radioactive waste'' means radioactive material that - 
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A)  is not high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or <BR>
byproduct material (as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title); and

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (B) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, consistent with existing law <BR>
and in accordance with paragraph (A), classifies as low-level radioactive waste.

<BR>
<BR>

<B>"Low-Level" Radioactive Waste: Examples</B>
<BR>
 <p class="indentpara"> &bull; Irradiated Components and Piping  --
 reactor hardware and pipes that are in continual contact with highly radioactive water for the lifetime of the plant.
 The metal becomes activated, or radioactive, by the bombardment of neutrons in the reactor area.  Also refered to as 
 "irradiated primary system components." </p>

 <p class="indentpara"> &bull; Control Rods -- from the core of nuclear power plants, these rods
 regulate and/or stop fission chain-reactions in the reactor by absorbing neutrons.</p>
 

 <p class="indentpara"> &bull; Poison Curtains --  also absorb neutrons, but from the water in the 
 reactor core and the irradiated fuel pool</p>
 

 <p class="indentpara"> &bull; Resins, Sludges, Filters, and Evaporator Bottoms --  
residues and cleaning wastes from the water that circulates around the irradiated fuel in the reactor vessel and in the fuel pool, which
which holds the irradiated fuel when it is removed from the core.


 <p class="indentpara"> &bull; Entire Nuclear Power Plants --  When decommissioned, everything from the entire 
 reactor vessel (minus the spent fuel rods) to the concrete floor is considered "low-level" waste.
 A typical 1000 megawatt reactor building floor contains 13,000 cubic feet of contaminated concrete, and 1,400 cubic feet of 
 contaminated reinforcing steel bar.   </p>
 
 <BR>
 
 Industry and government generally refer to radioactive waste in terms of volume, even though there can be 
 tremendous concentrations of radioactivity in a small volume, and small concentrations in a larger package.
 All of the medical waste from diagnosis and treatment shipped in a year from most states usually gives off 
 a fraction of one curie in radiation.  The average pressurized water reactor produces 1,900 curies per year, and the 
 average boiling water reactor produces 4,000 curies in "low level" waste every year.  
 The nuclear reactor waste is much more concentrated:

<B>11(e)(2) Byproduct Wastes</b>

 <p class="indentpara">
  11(e)(2) is generated during uranium milling, where
wastes known as tailings are left behind, and in the extraction or concentration of uranium or thorium from 
ore.   Tailings related to DOE operations are slated for cleanup under a program called 
the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Program (UMTRAP).
Much of the 11(e)(2) byproduct wastes also originates from Cold War bomb development projects
 which were conducted at sites across the country. </p>
 
 <BR>
 <p class="indentpara">Uranium mill tailings are the earthen residues
that remain after the extraction of uranium from ores.
Tailings are generated in very large volumes and
contain low concentrations of naturally occurring
radioactive materials. These materials comprise a
potential health hazard; the isotopes of major concern
are Radium-226 and its daughter, Radon-222.
</p>

 <BR>
<p class="indentpara">In 1978, the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Act (UMTRA) was passed, which created a 
legal definition 
  (section 11(e)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act) of waste generated from extracting uranium or thorium from ore.  
  It did not cover waste from uranium mining, which falls under the NORM category (see below).  The reason for this
  is that uranium mining is not formally considered part of the uranium fuel chain.  Interestingly, however, it does
   cover some waste from uranium conversion (pre-enrichment).
   
 Natural ores that are processed for rare-earth or other metals
have significant concentrations of radioactive elements.  The tailings
produced (which consist of the crushed depleted ore and the depleted
solution after recovery of metals and rare earths) are not 11(e)(2)
material.  This is because the ore was not processed primarily for its
source material content but for the rare earth or other metal. 
</p><BR>

 <p class="indentpara">
DOE created the Formerly Utilized Site Remedial
Action Program (FUSRAP) to address radiological contamination at sites used
by DOE's predecessor agencies, the Manhattan Engineer District (MED) and the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from the 1940s through the 1960s.
The FUSRAP program was transferred from
the DOE to the Army Corps of Engineers by the Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY98 (P.L. 105-62). </p>
<BR>

<p class="indentpara">When UMTRA passed, DOE sites which qualified were placed into two categories, either UMTRA Title I or Title II.
Title I were sites operated prior to 1978, and Title II were sites operated afterward.  Waste from FUSRAP sites 
is mostly considered 11(e)(2) waste, which may sometimes be an exception to the rules on the waste being related 
to extraction from ore.  At milling sites, contaminated materials such as cattle fencing are classified as 11(e)(2)
 due to the activities designated at the property.  As in other waste categorizations, it is the process from which the 
 waste was produced, and not the characteristics of the waste itself, which determines the classification.
</p>


<BR>


<B>Naturally Occuring or Accelerator Produced Radioactive Materials (NARM/NORM/TENORM)</B>
<p class="indentpara">
These are radioactive materials not covered under the AEA that are naturally
occurring or produced by an accelerator. These materials have been traditionally regulated by
States. 

Natural occuring NORM contains radionuclides (e.g., Ra-226, Rn-222, Th-232,   
U-238) existing throughout the earth’s crust.  NORM waste with more than 2 nCi/g of 226Ra or
equivalent is commonly referred to as discrete NORM waste; below this
threshold, the waste is referred to as diffuse NORM waste. NORM waste is not
covered under the AEA, not a form of LLW, and is not regulated by NRC.   
Accelerator wastes include accelerator targets, wastes from
accelerator maintenance or D&D, and wastes from
radiopharmaceutical manufacture. </p><BR>


<p class="indentpara">Discrete NORM wastes have a

relatively small volume but large radioactivity and
include industrial gauges, old radium watch and
industrial dials, radium needles in medical equipment,
resins (filters) that remove radioactive radium from
public drinking water, and some radiopharmaceutical
waste.

Diffuse NORM wastes are characterized by a
relatively large volume with small radioactivity.
These materials result from industrial processes and
include: coal ash and slag from utility electrical generation;
 solid wastes from geothermal energy production;
 slag, leachate, and tailings from the mining and
processing of metals other than uranium or thorium
(e.g., copper);
 sludge from drinking water treatment;
 scale, sludge, produced water, and equipment from
oil and natural-gas production containing NORM;
and
  wastes (phosphogypsum and slag) from mining
phosphate ores for fertilizer (ammonium
phosphate) production. 
</p><BR>
<p class="indentpara">
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) is a subset of
NARM and refers to materials whose radioactivity has
been enhanced (radionuclide concentrations are either increased or
redistributed where they are more likely to cause exposure to humans) usually by
mineral extraction or processing activities. Examples are exploration and
production wastes from the oil and natural gas industry and phosphate slag
piles from the phosphate mining industry. This term is not used to describe or
discuss the natural radioactivity of rocks and soils, or background radiation,
but instead refers to materials whose radioactivity is technologically enhanced
by controllable practices such as extraction from underground.  
Sometimes it is referred to as TENORM.

 <p class="indentpara"><b>Other Waste Types:</b></p>
<BR>

<B>Mixed Waste (MW)</B>
<p class="indentpara">Mixed waste contains both hazardous waste
(as defined by RCRA and its amendments-see below) and any type of radioactive waste (as defined by
AEA and its amendments). It is jointly regulated by NRC and EPA (or State-level equivalent agencies).
 The fundamental and most
comprehensive statutory definition is found in the Federal Facilities
Compliance Act (FFCA) where Section 1004(41) was added to RCRA: "The term
'mixed waste' means waste that contains both hazardous waste and source,
special nuclear, or byproduct material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of
1954."  Mixed Low-Level Waste (MLLW) is just mixed waste with a radioactive component consisting
 of "low-level" radioactive waste.
</p>

  <BR>
  <B>Exempted Radioactive Materials - "Below Regulatory Concern"</b>
<p class="indentpara">
  This is not a waste type category, but should be explained as one would.
  Some materials which emit low levels of radiation can be petitioned to be classified as 
  exempted from being classified as radioactive waste.  This is a legal way of stating that the material
  is no longer considered radioactive, and can be disposed of as hazardous waste in a RCRA landfill.
  There is no State or Federal amount stated for what is to be considered as exempted in this manner, 
  and the oversight of regulatory authorities deems what is appropriate in a particular case
 as defined in 10 CFR 40.13(a) [for Texas see 25 TAC Section 285.251(c)(1)]
  Some people in the regulatory field mistakenly refer to a figure originating from the
   US Department of Transportation of 200 mrem/hr, which is an irrelevant limit for freight 
   containers.  Not only does the NRC disapprove of this practice, but it is also scoffed at by
   experienced regulators.
Due to the high costs of low-level radioactive waste disposal, exempting material is a fairly common
method of handling waste.  In many cases, waste is diluted or "cut" with 
non-radioactive materials by a generator to lower radioactivity to a level 
which can be deemed as "below regulatory concern" for disposal.
</p>
<BR>
  
  
  <B>Special Nuclear Material (SNM)</b>
<p class="indentpara">
SNM has considerable percentages of fissionable material to be a special concern to management.  
Includes plutonium, uranium-233, or uranium enriched in the isotopes uranium-233 or uranium-235.  SNM is
defined in 10 CFR 20.1003 as "(1) Plutonium, uranium-233, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in isotope 235, and
any other material that the NRC, pursuant to the provisions of section 51 of the AEA, determines to be SNM, but does
not include source material; (2) or any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing but does not include
source material." SNM is important in the fabrication of weapons grade materials and as such has strict licensing
and handling controls.  
Management at LLW dumps must demonstrate to have had training and experience handling 
fissionable materials before the site can be allowed to handle SNM.
SNM is obviously a national security issue.
</p>
<BR>
  
  
  <B>Source Material</b>
  <p class="indentpara"> Source Material is the uranium or thorium ores mined from the earth. Source material is
  defined in 10 CFR 20.1003 as "(1) Uranium, or thorium or any combination of uranium and thorium in any physical or
  chemical form; or (2) Ores that contain, by weight, one-twentieth of 1 percent (0.05 percent), or more, of
  uranium, thorium, or any combination or uranium and thorium."  Source material does not include special nuclear
  material or byproduct material.
</p>
<BR>
  
  <B>Special Case Waste</b>
<p class="indentpara">
Waste that is not high-level or transuranic waste, but requires greater confinement than of
 standard radioactive waste disposal methods.
</p>
<BR>
  

<B>Depleted Uranium</b><BR>
<p class="indentpara">Depleted uranium (DU) is in such surplus that massive amounts sit stored in corroding tanks at the enrichment plants in gaseous form 
(uranium hexaflouride- UF<sub>6</sub>).  The primary use of depleted uranium is by the military, which use its 
characteristics as one of the densest elements known for armor and for aircraft wing counterweights.  
They also make armor-peircing missles which
use a chemical characteristic of DU.  When DU weaponry is fired at a tank, it superheats upon impact and burns up, 
drilling a hole through the target, and dispersing powdered DU throughout the immediate area.  When this material is airborne, 
such as in conditions like Desert Storm in Iraq, it has been found to go downwind anywhere in a 60-mile radius.
DU is an alpha emitter, and has an extremely long halflife.  As a solid metal, it is not dangerous aside from minor exposure to the skin 
on contact.  Risk is raised considerably when it is in a gas or airborne powder as produced when burned up.  The risk of lung cancer is raised,
 but microscopic particles can also pass through to many parts of the body through the bloodstream.
</p>
<BR>

 <p class="indentpara">Veterans and their families have amassed enormous amounts of information on the 
 toxic effects of DU.  
 Many of them have had personal experiences where
  either themselves or a loved one had contracted medical complications after the Gulf War. 
    Often they had been given nonfunctional treatments based on misdiagnosis by VA doctors, and turned away.
    They found that they were not alone, 
  and pooled their research with nongovernmental Veterans groups. The main reason the US military denies the effects of DU is simple- if DU is considered 
  a chemical weapon, the US would be harshly criticized for violating the Geneva Convention.  
  (DU is not a "nuclear weapon", since its use does not involve triggering a fission chain-reaction)
Many veterans have died, some of them had posed for pictures next to tanks covered in white DU dust in the Middle East.  Often,
veterans recall that their commanding officers sometimes had worn protective clothing while GI's were not briefed or informed that 
they were handling a toxic substance.
</p>
<BR>
  
  <B>Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Substances</B>
  <BR>
 <p class="indentpara"> Hazardous waste is waste which is defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and does not 
 contain materials which are considered radioactive from a regulatory standpoint.  
 It can be waste which a generator has declared to be hazardous, or contains any of a wide variety of organic and 
 inorganic material, heavy metals, and/or other hazardous constituents.
 </p><BR>
<p class="indentpara"> Some materials are not regulated under RCRA, but are hazardous.  These materials are generally considered
 hazardous under either the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) or the Comprehensive Environmental 
 Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, widely known as Superfund), and include contaminants such as 
 PCB's, asbestos, and petroleum products.  These materials are not considered hazardous waste, and are called "hazardous
  substances."
