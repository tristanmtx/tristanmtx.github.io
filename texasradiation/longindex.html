<B>Historical Overview Of 
Texas Nuclear Power Plants</b>
<BR>
 Both Comanche Peak and South Texas
Project plants not only have a long history of 
accidents, internal corruption, and harassment
of staff who raise safety concerns, but also 
problems which revealed a subculture of 
corruption at the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission.  Cost overruns in tens of billions 
of dollars for each plant has forced the rates
of City utility partners to skyrocket.

<B>The Legacy Of South Texas
Uranium Mining</B> 
<BR>
 Between 1955 and 1995, companies 
drilled throughout South Texas extracting
 uranium.  These vast activities have greatly 
increased the groundwater concentrations 
of toxic material. Although the DOE has 
been "remediating" a few of the dozens 
of these sites, they have openly  declared
cleanup of the aquifers impossible due to
the massive contamination.

<B>The Sustainable Alternatives to Nuclear Power:<BR>
Wind, Solar, and Fuel Cells</B>
<BR>

 Texas is already a world leader in producing 
energy from wind power, with 1,103 megawatts
capacity.  Developing more wind farms and 
installing the wiring to deliver this kind of
power to major cities can free our state from nuclear power.  The clean 
alternatives to nuclear power are not only 
environmentally responsible, but also exponentially 
less expensive and provide a means of  
upgrading from the bloated outdated 
technology of the nuclear fuel cycle to 
move into the 21st century.

<B>Nuclear Power Air Pollution:
Large Percentages of 
<BR>
Carbon Dioxide and Ozone Depleting CFC Emissions</B>
<BR>

88% of US CFC emissions result from 
uranium enrichment in addition to 
1,300,000 tons in CO2 emissions per year
 per nuclear plant during uranium mining 
and plant construction.    Reprocessing 
spent fuel is cost-prohibitive, and use of 
plutonium or mixed oxide (MOx) fuel in 
reactors has not only proved to be extremely
dangerous, but is also seen to encourage the
proliferation of plutonium.

<B>History Of Texas Waste Dumps</B> <BR>
The earliest waste dumps in Texas were located 
at two uranium mills: Conoco's Conquista and 
Chevron's Panna Maria.  The University of Texas
System later built it's own warehouse at 
Ft Stockton for it's waste.  In the 1980's, the 
formation of the Texas Low-level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority set in motion a search
for a disposal site which was consistently met 
with citizen opposition: 1983-'84 Hudspeth County
in Dell City, in 1985-'87 in McMullen County, in 
1987-'91 in Ft Hancock, and in 1991-'98 in Sierra
Blanca.  Texas joined theTexas Compact as host 
state to dispose of waste from Maine and Vermont.
Sierra Blanca was to be the disposal facility for the
compact prior to international opposition from the 
Mexican government.  Another compact dump has 
not been sited, but is considered for placement 
at WCS in Andrews County.

<B>Waste Control Specialists<bR>
Low-Level Waste Facility In Andrews, Tx</b>
<BR>
 Waste Control Specialist LLC owns a low-level
radioactive waste processing and storage facility
which has dumped several hundred thousand
cubic feet of "exempted" low-level waste into an 
onsite hazardous waste landfill.  It resides on the 
Ogallala aquifer, is near seismic activity, and has 
a floodplain running through the facility.  WCS's 
goal is to obtain a disposal license and become
a full DOE disposal contractor, but Texas law currently
requires that only a state agency be granted a 
full disposal license.  WCS sells the Andrews dump
primarily by enticing DOD and DOE offices that 
obtaining an exemption on waste and disposing 
of it at Andrews is cheaper than disposing
at a licensed low-level waste dump.  Diluting waste
to qualify for an exemption is not uncommon.  
Surprisingly, regulators are not maintaining any 
inventory or data on the exempted low-level waste
dumped at Andrews.

<B>The Gamble of Assured Isolation:<BR>
Differing Disposition and Playing With Garbage
</b>

<BR>
Assured isolation is a plan for a deregulated waste dump- with a public relations twist.
Since placing a nuclear waste dumps in our State has received such opposition, 
lawmakers are employing a concept touted as an alternative, yet which reveals itself as
a means to evade public criticism by simply postponing calling the place a disposal site.
This proposal also makes claims that environmental monitoring and siting criteria should be weakened
due to the presence of radiation counters and cameras inside of the building.
Not only is there no clear definition of assured isolation by federal authorities, but the same 
federal authorities have announced that they do not endorse the idea.
Our overview includes a top-10 list on why this idea stinks.

<B>The Texas Compact:<BR>
Leftover Contract from a Broken System
</b>

<BR>
 The Texas Compact is an agreement ratified by US Congress which dictates that Texas 
 should be responsible for disposing of waste from Maine and Vermont.  Since Texas has not yet 
 built a dump for this purpose, the preliminary motions which financially obligate Texas to do so
 have not yet occurred.  Several similar state compacts have dissolved and the compact system has been
 determined to be a failure by chairpersons of the NRC and others.  
 The Texas Compact must be renewed by the US Congress this year, and Maine already voted to drop 
 out of the agreement.   Texas can still say no, and save itself from the imposed penalties which 
 are promised by the agreement.  Will lawmakers stand up and say no?

<B>National "Low-Level" RadWaste Dumps: <BR>
Every Single One Has Leaked
</b>
<BR>
From Maxey Flats to Barnwell to Envirocare's site in Utah,
 every single "low-level" waste dump ever built has leaked.
 This is a short overview of some of these dumps, and provides a glimpse
 of what's in store for us if we allow a dump to be built.
 We are told that an assured isolation site won't leak, but it has never been attempted.
Texas has a long history, illustrated in the mining 
sections, of coping with the problems of radioactive contaminants in our groundwater.
If a Texas waste dump is built, whether called "assured isolation" or not,
it will likely remind us that the lessons of the past are valuable wisdom 
to be respected.  What is the meaning of national security if we allow our 
groundwater to be contaminated?

<B>Dump for Texas Waste is Unjustified. <BR>
Comparing DOE, Compact, and Texas Amounts
</b>
<BR>
Out of 64 existing Texas radioactive material licenses, 45 generate waste and 52 store waste.
Nearly 80% of waste stored is brought in from outside the State by WCS in Andrews,
and 96% of the waste generated comes from the 2 nuclear power plants.
Waste from other sources generally decay rapidly and are never destined for a licensed radioactive waste dump.
The US Dept of Energy amounts are exponentially larger- for the decade of 2000-2010,
the DOE says it will have 249 million cubic feet for disposal-
a whopping 92 times the 35-year total 
from the Texas Compact and 441 times a 10-year estimate of waste from Texas!
WCS lobbys hard to be a disposal site for DOE waste, and says they won't profit
 enough from waste from just the Texas Compact- this shows the risk involved.

<B>Texas High-Level Waste Issues:<BR>
Transports To Yucca Mountain</b>
<BR>
 By now everybody has heard of the plan to 
dispose of high-level waste including spent fuel
at Yucca Mountain.  By the DOE's plan, more
spent fuel will be sitting at our power plants
when Yucca Mountain is closed than is currently
stored.   Trucks with out-of-state high-level 
waste shipments will be coming through Texas
 over I-20, I-40, and I-35, and as accident 
projections appear grim, concern is coupled 
with vulnerability of the shipments to 
terrorist attack.

<B>WIPP: Transuranic Waste Shipped Through<BR>
Texas To Be Dumped Underground in Carlsbad</b>
<BR>
 Waste Isolation Pilot Project near Carlsbad is
a DOE facility to actually dispose of transuranic
waste deep underground in unshielded carved 
rooms underneath an aquifer which feeds the 
Pecos River.  Below this dump are pressurized 
saltwater lakes which  threaten to flood the 
storage rooms and corrode the 55-gallon 
drums.  Amazingly, it has been considered the 
alternate location for the high-level waste dump
sited at Yucca Mountain.  This waste comes 
through Texas on I-20.

<B>Pantex Nuclear Weapons Plant: Assembly, Disassembly, and 
Plutonium Storage</b>
<BR>
Pantex has served as the assembly plant for the entire US nuclear
 weapons stockpile since the beginning of the Cold War.  All 
 components of the weapons were brought to Pantex and bombs were 
 shipped out to either the silos or the test sites.  When the Cold War 
 was over, Pantex's mission was switched to that of dismantelling of weapons 
 and the storage of surplus plutonium.  This, however, is changing as the 
 Bush administration has presented plans to build more bombs, and in addition,
 produce more plutonium and tritium for this new nuclear weapons buildup.
