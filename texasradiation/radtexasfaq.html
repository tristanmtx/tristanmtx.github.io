<!-- Much belated updates have been added, and more should be to come prior and during the 79th Texas State Legislative session.   -->
<!-- The "Action" section has been more appropriately named "News."  Earlier in the year, open records and geological materials relating to WCS's  -->
<!-- Andrews County site were brought over from the now defunct "Stop Andrews Nuclear Waste Dump!" website.  The first new addition to come up will be -->
<!-- an updated regional map and the long-promised section "What is D.O.E. Waste?"  Other projects which were started before Jan 2004  -->
<!-- (when focus had to shift to making a living at an unrelated day-job) that were then put on hold will probably follow slowly as I  -->
<!-- pick up where they were left off. -->

<!-- <BR><BR> -->
<!-- The author's excruciatingly stressful day job which prevented resources  -->
<!-- to be devoted to this issue this year is now a thing of the past.  This is a positive move for the website, and housing has been  -->
<!-- provided to the continue work despite unemployment, but more than ever, financial assistance is needed greatly.  Money is needed to maintain  -->
<!-- items such as the paying the phone bill, distributing printed material, and similar items.  In July, day-job wages were saved up, and a replacement  -->
<!-- computer was bought for the project, which raised the author's financial investment in the project to just over $4000 since it began in 2001. -->
<!-- Meanwhile, not one donation has been made to assist the project through the PO Box, or the PayPal  account which were set up for this purpose.  -->

<B>About this site</b><BR>
<span class="sans13"><I>
This site has basically been put on mothballs since 2006 or so- however- it still serves as the only 
source of an omnibus historical overview of the nuclear history of Texas.  In 2008, Waste Control 
Specialists in Andrews County recieved the license to dump waste that we discuss here, and the uranium 
mining operations have continued to start up again.  Alot of people put alot of work during the 
legislature over the years trying to fight this stuff, which is an uphill battle as the powerful corporate interests have our state in their grasp, influencing lawmakers and the regulatory process.
This site should prove valuable to all who take up the fight, and want to have a solid foundation of the background has they begin to work on these subjects.
Thanks you for using it, and I hope that it functions as one of the most important resources in your toolbox toward promoting safe, renewable, and sustainable 
alternatives to nuclear fuel. <BR>

<BR><BR>

This site was created to address the lack of readily available information on
the nuclear history of Texas, and to provide educational materials on the basic 
principles behind radioactivity for the novice.  There are also legal issues 
about radioactive waste to cover, and some reference material has been added
on all of these areas and more.  

 What started as a means to gather all of the
 information in one place for myself was branching off
into another entity, and so I began to incorporate small lessons to supplement it
into becoming a standalone curriculum for native Texans. 
<BR><BR>
The concept for Texas Radiation Online was created during the 77th Texas State Legislature in 
2001, developed in the following year and a half, and opened to the public in December 2002.
During the 78th regular State legislative session, it reported the
news on radioactive waste legislation, released many factsheets, and issued contact 
information to the public to contact thier senators and representatives.  
We visited with the staff of the related House and Senate Committees, reporting the geological,
legal, and public safety problems with licensing a radioactive waste dump in Texas.

<BR><BR>
Texas Radiation *purposely* does not have a membership, nor a board of directors, 
which have been deemed as counterproductive to the effort at hand.
This project operates efficiently with as few cooks as possible, although we do have our informal advisors.

It does not have a 501(c)(3) status, and it is not formally affiliated with
 any major Texas environmentalist group or organization, nor does it receive financial aid or funding from such sources.
There have been, however, a very small list of people have allowed access 
to their files to use in the project, and without that sort of intellectual contribution
it probably would not have been completed in time for the 78th 
Texas State Legislature.  
<BR><BR>

Organizing is primariliy left to individuals and existing organizations, and is somewhat necessary considering the project's very limited 
budget and personnel, but is mostly due to the size of Texas.  I am currently advising and encouraging the development of a group in Austin which 
will be a separate entity, so that that community will be given proper credit for their work.  

The travel and time expense to visit with regional groups across the state is cost-prohibitive and inefficient 
when the basic content can be broadcast and repeated very easily as it is.  The
 <a  target="_blank"  class="redlink12" href="action.html">legislative action and news page</a> directs readers to contact House and Senate members when appropriate, and 
 offers our factsheets and fliers for download and distribution in other regions.

<B>Fundraising and Finances</B><BR>
One of the reasons that the site has been allowed to develop has ironically been
the economic recession.  I have been underemployed as a programmer and network technician 
since layoffs at my previous workplace
in February 2001.  

Along with the lack of job opportunities and endless hiring freezes in effect,
 the opportunity to devote more time to the wider scope of nukes in Texas 
  was a task which I felt my responsibility to undertake. 
When the project began, I had a small office at my home to devote to my work, but was soon later 
forced to vacate.   For the remainder of the project, the office was forced to go portable while 
reference materials and personal belongings 
 were kept in a rented storage room (interim storage).  

<BR><BR>
It was determined early that seeking out grants for the project would be futile if 
there was nothing substantial already in place, and there have also been time constraints in doing so, but 
financial needs have arisen for which I am 
unable to provide myself until this economy improves. 



Again, please either click on the "donate" button on the main index, 
or click  <a  target="_blank"  class="redlink12" href="donate.html">here</a>
 for directions on how to donate.
 Money will be used for server space, printing factsheets and other teaching materials, fliers, advertising, 
 paying off open records fees, and other expenses of keeping the ship afloat and getting the word out.

<B>Q:</B>  I have heard stuff about military and academic disposal in Texas, but don't see it mentioned much at the site.  Plus, 
what's up with the campus reactors at A&M and UT Austin? 
<BR><BR>
<B>A:</B>  Excellent question.  I wanted to devote more to these subjects, but haven't had enough material to do so.  Here's a bit:
<BR><BR>

There are two TRIGA research reactors at A&M and one at UT Austin. The UT Austin TRIGA  can operate
 at power 
levels up to 1 MW or in the pulsing mode where powers as high as 1500 MW can be
achieved for about 10 msec.  It used to be in the basement of Taylor Hall, right in the middle of campus.
  It was moved to Pickle Research Center  after contaminants were found leaking into Waller Creek.
  (that facility was formerly named the "Balcones" Research Center, a name adopted from the regional
  geologic faultline).   Waste for 
UT System is stored at Fort Stockton.
<BR><BR>


[Much of this is taken from <a target="_blank" class="redlink12" href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/~netl/index.html">UT's page</a>] 
The TRIGA Mark II is a research reactor developed by General Atomics for education and research.  The word TRIGA is an acronym for 
Training, Research, Isotope Production, General Atomics.
It is used for reactor physics experiments, reactor power training, and the study of reactor kinetics and control.  
"The above-ground fixed uranium core is located at the bottom of a 27-foot deep water-filled tank surrounded by a concrete shield structure.  
The highly purified water in the tank serves as the reactor coolant, a neutron moderator, and a transparent radiation shield.  
Cylindrical voids in the concrete shield structure, called neutron beam ports, allow neutrons to stream out away from the core,
and are used for isotope activation and production.  It utilizes four control rods.  Three of these rods, one regulating and two shim, 
are sealed stainless steel tubes containing powdered boron carbide followed by uranium zirconium hydride (UZrH).  As these rods are withdrawn, boron
(a neutron absorber) leaves the core and UZrH (the fuel) enters the core, increasing power.  The fourth control rod, the transient rod, is
a solid cylinder of borated graphite clad in aluminum operated by pneumatic pressure to permit pulse operation.  The sudden ejection of
the transient rod produces an immediate burst of power."  So, thanks UT for that description.

As far as military disposal and stuff is concerned, we know that bases all over Texas have dumped waste, and naturally for national
security, this is mostly classified.  Bergstrom AFB dumped radwaste in the southwest side of the base, and of course was later converted into
an international airport.  Another concern is the use of depleted uranium ammunition (DU) in training exercises.  Airborne DU dust
particles have a range of 60 miles in conditions such as in Iraq and Kuwait, and are seen as the culprit of Gulf War Syndrome.  
When the testing range in Vieques was to be moved to 
Texas, this was a primary concern, as well as other toxic material from explosives.  
Fort Hood is the most likely place for DU to be tested, in Texas, but not exclusively.
Pantex has a station which still explodes "conventional explosives" in a containment, yet DU escapes from 
the containment and have been detected in the surrounding properties.

<B>Q:</B>  I have heard about a Texas group called Beyond Nuclear Power.  Is that Texas Radiation Online?


<BR><BR>
<B>A:</B>  
No, that is a project of the
Sierra Club's Lone Star Chapter.  They have an area at the 
<a target="_blank"  class="redlink12" href="http://lonestar.sierraclub.org/">Lone Star Chapter's website</a>, (when the page loads, 
click on "radioactive waste").  
  This site is not directly affiliated with the Beyond Nuclear Power group or 
  the Sierra Club.  We can back most of the Beyond group's points, but do not see them as critical of any aspect of the assured 
  isolation concept.  Demands they make of assured isolation are already offered to us traditionally, and are thus not demands at all.    
We can also support some points of another related coalition, the
<a target="_blank"  class="redlink12" href="http://www.allianceforcleantexas.org/">Alliance For Clean Texas</a>.  SEED Coalition 
and Public Citizen are also active partners in Alliance for Clean Texas, and bring it credit with the excellent insight they have 
in the great potential of wind power generation and hydrogen fuel cells to the Texas economy.  The Beyond group is centered on 
waste specifically.  ACT's platform is broader and covers more of the big picture energy-wise, such as alternatives to waste generation.

<B>Q:</B>  I have heard about a Texas group called Nuclear-Free Texas.  Is that Texas Radiation Online?


<BR><BR>
<B>A:</B>  
No, that is a small grassroots project which I advise.    
I imagine that they will remain active in the future, especially with 
the latest developments of this past legislative session.
<BR>
Update: They just got a website up: <a target="_blank"  class="redlink12" href="http://www.NuclearFreeTexas.org/">www.NuclearFreeTexas.org</a>

  <B>Terms of Usage</B><BR>
  Eventually, each section of the website will be available in PDF format, so that the reader can obtain printer-friendly
  chapters.  People are encouraged to print out parts of the website for educational purposes, but it is asked that no 
  content be modified, and that it remain as intact as reasonably possible.  There have been incidents where individuals have taken 
  work which had been fact-checked, and had incorporated large chunks into thier fliers, but unfortunately added significant 
  misinformation into them in the process, and made it appear that it was still our official publication (matching typeface, 
  similar layout, etc.).  In this instance, the person also intended and 
  began to send this material to the press, which could have seriously affected our public relations.
    We can not be held responsible for such actions, so we have to say "all rights reserved" and ask that the 
  material not be altered in the dissemination process- but at the same time want to encourage duplication 
  for educational purposes.

<B>Thank You's and Credit Due</B><BR>
I would like to thank Tom "Smitty" Smith for contributing his personal 
collection of material for me to xerox.  Without his contribution, the material on uranium mining and our
power plants would be seriously lacking historical narrarative and substance.
The older Texas Energy Alliance mining collection which he had copies of
were nearly impossible to locate in their entirety.  I would also like to thank Karen Hadden
for her support, and for being real.  I also want to thank Bill Addington of the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund.
Whereas we don't get to see eachother as often as I would like, and I didn't get to dig into his archives, 
he was an additional source of inspiration. 
There were some particularly discouraging events which occured during early project development, but honest people like 
these and others kept me from becoming entirely cynical during that difficult beginning, and it's also  
nice to know who you can trust.  A big thanks also goes to Diane, Michael, and the rest of the team at 
<a target="_blank" class="redlink12" href="http://www.nirs.org">NIRS</a>, as well as the CMEP folks at 
<a target="_blank" class="redlink12" href="http://www.citizen.org">Public Citizen</a> in Washington.  
Also thanks to Don at 
<a target="_blank" class="redlink12" href="http://www.sric.org">SRIC</a>, and Geoff at

  I want to thank the members of the RadWaste Four, 
who got arrested protesting the 77th Legislative Session's radwaste bills, and are to be penalized for some time for 
speaking out.  This prompted Associated Press to give the Texas waste story some brief national coverage.
The trial lasted almost 2 years, raised spirits and kept the waste issue alive 
locally while the legislature was not in session.  Although the media attention had later fizzled out,
it ended up serving a crucial purpose.
The defense attorneys on the case did an excellent job, pro bono -
and even put up with me asking hypothetical project-related legal questions that were unrelated to the case.
There are a couple of others who I would like to thank, but I believe they would 
prefer that they not be mentioned by name on the internet.

Last, but certainly not least- part of the inspiration of this project was the work of Susan Lee Solar,
who had to leave the planet last year due to complications of pneumonia.  During her life, she had devoted herself to 
this cause, and one of the contributions she made to the movement was a touring museum of nuclear history and issues- 
a school bus which was converted into a mobile nuclear museum.
A website can not replace such a physical entity which does not just inspire awe and wonder in younger generations,
but also performs the crucial task of taking the information to the people on the street, who may not be privileged
with access to computers or the internet.  This project was based on the idea of the providing factsheets
overviewing all aspects of nukes for printed distribution, which will not sufficiently fill the void either, but 
it sounds like friends and family of Susan Lee have been discussing reviving the museum.
Check out the <a target="_blank" class="redlink12" href="http://www.aimproductions.com/SusanLee/">Susan Lee Solar Memorial website</a>
for any available details like this.  Hopefully, someone will bless our demonstrations this legislature with a visit 
from Susan Lee's Energy Dragon!
