UT System may house nuclear reactor in 2012
Site could reprocess waste from plants, perform research

By Yashoda Sampath 

The University of Texas System will host the first
high-temperature nuclear reactor in the country by
2012.

UT-Permian Basin in Odessa is working with the
nuclear consulting company General Atomics to
build the test reactor in Andrews County in West
Texas. Andrews County recently became home to all
of the nation's low-level radioactive waste.

"That helps us because we already have facilities
for waste storage treatment and disposal," said
Jim Wright, project coordinator at UT-Permian
Basin

Generation IV, a consortium of international
governments, power companies and researchers
formed by the U.S. Department of Energy, made a
rule that the United States must update all
nuclear reactors by 2030. The proposed reactor
would be the first in the United States.

The Andrews reactor would be used to test and
conduct research for a proposed commercial reactor
in Idaho.

"We believe that this country is in a position
where all the nuclear technology is being
developed in other places," said Wright.

Japan and China have already constructed reactors
with the new high-temperature technology, which
would go up to 1,000 degrees Celsius.

The new reactor will have three primary
experimental uses: nuclear research on the fuel
cycle, which follows uranium usage from start
until finish; hydrogen production; and
high-temperature research.

Until now, waste was not reprocessed, as the
reprocessing produces plutonium, and the United
States didn't want plutonium to proliferate during
the Cold War, Wright said. Now, the plutonium and
uranium would be used together to fuel the
reactor. Experiments will also be conducted with
an element called thorium, which is
self-generating - when burned it creates more fuel
to use. This decreases the initial amount needed
for a reaction. Wright added that thorium is a
much more abundant mineral than uranium.

The facility will also research hydrogen fuel
production. The high temperatures of the test
reactor can convert water directly to hydrogen
without using a catalyst, said Wright. This won't
create any waste product and will be the most
efficient way to get hydro-powered cars and houses
on the market, he said.

Karen Hadden, co-director of the environmental
advocacy group SEED Coalition, said that the idea
of using a nuclear reactor to create clean energy
is a contradiction.

"I don't think it's a good idea for UT to be
involved in this," she said. "We already are
bidding for Los Alamos and already manage Sandia,
in addition to the reactor at the Pickle Campus. I
would characterize this as nuclear madness."

The reactor will not be involved in weapons
production, but will be used to research the best
methods of recycling disused nuclear weapon
elements from the Cold War.

To counteract any attempts at theft, the reactor
will be fully underground. Additionally, the fuel
for the reactor will be deeply encased within
three layers of ceramic, making up spheres .8
millimeters in diameter. The ceramic spheres are
then encased in blocks of graphite.

"Terrorists would have to separate literally
millions of the spheres in order to get enough
fuel," Wright said.

Wright said the reactor shuts itself down
automatically when it reaches 1,500 degrees
Celsius. The ceramic coating withstands
temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. Together, these
safety measures would eliminate the possibility of
nuclear meltdowns, Wright said. The ceramic
coatings would also function as safe storage.

The disasters of Chernobyl in Russia and Three
Mile Island in Pennsylvania were caused by using
water coolant, which overflowed and led to
overheating and meltdown. The test reactor would
instead use gas coolant.

The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club questions
using nuclear research, regardless of the
benefits. Spokeswoman Donna Hoffman cited nuclear
waste as a pressing issue.

"Los Alamos radioactivity is already migrating
underground to the Rio Grande River," she said.
"We should have learned our lesson by now."

Wright said with the new technology, waste would
be reduced by half. Efficiency, currently
estimated at 33 percent, will increase to more
than 50 percent.

Researchers from the UT System and Sandia and Los
Alamos National Laboratories will collaborate with
UTPB's project.

Estimates put the reactor's final price tag at
around $400 million, Wright said. The federal
government will pay for 90 percent, and UTPB would
look for private sources for the remainder.
Already, $3 million has been raised to fund
preliminary designs, which will be shown to
potential investors.

Andrews eyes nuclear test reactor
UTPB, General Atomics, Andrews officials discuss building next-generation plant

By David J. Lee
Odessa American

UTPB and General Atomics are looking at a new type
of nuclear technology Ñ one that could fuel both
electricity and transportation Ñ and they'd like
to put a reactor here in West Texas.

University of Texas of the Permian Basin President
David Watts said San Diego-based General Atomics
has developed the nuclear program based on
technology used overseas.

"It uses technology that has been adopted in
China, Japan and is under consideration for
adoption in South Africa," Watts said. "The point
is that the technology is inherently safe. It is a
new development in nuclear reactor technology."

While still only in the discussion stage, Watts
said UTPB and General Atomics would like to
develop a Very High Temperature Test Nuclear
Reactor.

"Since this technology has not been used anywhere
in the United States, we believe that the
opportunity is ripe for the design and
construction of this Very High Temperature Test
Reactor," Watts said. "We hope it will be sited in
Andrews County."

Andrews City Manager Glen Hackler said it doesn't
appear the city or county is averse to that.

On Tuesday, UTPB officials presented the idea of
the reactor, as well as the possibility of putting
it in Andrews, to the city, county, economic
development board and industrial base of the West
Texas community.

"After the meeting, I milled around with quite a
few of the people there, and the reaction I got
was constantly favorable of people from Andrews,"
Hackler said. "I think it's got a real appeal from
a conceptual standpoint."

The concept of the Very High Temperature Test
Nuclear Reactor is one that could provide both
electric energy and hydrogen fuel. The reactor
process also creates the sulfur-iodine technology
for hydrogen production.

"This technology, because of the high heat it
generates, promises to bring a variety of new
economically powerful applications here, such as
production of cheap hydrogen," Watts said. "This
technology may be the answer to the question of
how do you have a cheap and reliable source of
hydrogen for a hydrogen-based economy."

Even more, the technology Ñ which has been tested
in Asian countries Ñ is inherently safe, Watts
said.

"There is no risk of any kind of nuclear
meltdown," he said. "It is a new technology,
presently unlike anything used in the United
States for nuclear reactors."

In a letter General Atomics Senior Vice President
David Baldwin wrote to Watts, Baldwin said a
concept design, which is needed to apply for
grants, would cost about $3 million. The money
would be raised through grants and outside
donations, he said. The cost of the reactor would
run about $100 million.

"It is anticipated that, once these facilities are
built, they would be operated by UTPB and/or its
designees," Baldwin wrote. "The research faculty
at UTPB will use this facility to not only support
the development of the (Next Generation Nuclear
Plant) but also energy research in cooperation
with other national and international
organizations."

Dr. James "Jim" Wright, project director for the
nuclear proposal, said a test plant in Andrews
would pave the way for a full-scale Next
Generation Nuclear Plant elsewhere.

"The Very High Temperature Test Reactor to be
built by UTPB and General Atomics, we believe it
is a logical technology stepping stone to the Very
High Temperature Reactor," Wright said. "It will
be used to (a) test and verify many of the
required technologies, and (b) refine the nuclear
fuel cycle, before they are tried in the much more
expensive Next Generation Nuclear Plant."

Meanwhile, Watts and Hackler both said the
possibility of a project is a long way off Ñ
Tuesday's meeting was solely an informational talk
to get community reaction of the idea.

"They're talking about trying a feasibility study
in a year," Hackler said. "If that's successful
and there's a general receptiveness in our
community, the timeline for the reactor is five or
six years."

Watts said the university has long been interested
in finding alternative energy sources, which led
to its relationship with General Atomics.

"UTPB has been involved in energy research for
some time and began to explore the nuclear area
and formed a partnership with General Atomics,
which has developed the technology we're
interested in seeing applied in a test nuclear
reactor," Watts said.

Hackler said Andrews officials were impressed with
the presentation Tuesday.

"For Andrews, having the UT system involved gives
it great credibility," Hackler said. "General
Atomics and their 50-year history in nuclear
technology and the nuclear research field gives it
great credibility."

Watts said Andrews seemed like a logical choice.

"We believe that the city and county of Andrews Ñ
which has had a substantial discussion over
decades regarding the operation of nuclear
faculties such as Water Control Systems and
Louisiana Exploration Services, directly adjacent
to Waste Control Systems Ñ would consider allowing
this project to be sited in their county," Watts
said.

Hackler said he would hope a test reactor would
actually eliminate some of the stigma Andrews has
gotten with the nuclear waste sites.

"We get the stigma that goes with being a nuclear
waste landfill site or waste disposal site," he
said. "It'd be nice to have the prestige that
comes with a major research-development,
world-class facility for nuclear energy right here
in the Permian Basin in our county."

Andrews looking to build nuclear reactor

n 'Next generation' reactor would only be used for 
research and testing, would not generate energy.

By Ruth Campbell

Staff Writer

Andrews residents do their homework. That's one
reason city and county officials say they're
willing to take risks that might send other
communities running for the hills.

During the past 10 to 15 years, the city and
county have obtained Waste Control Specialists, a
low-level radioactive waste depository on the Lea
County, N.M., border, and next door to that is the
proposed site of Louisiana Energy Services uranium
enrichment facility.

Now the University of Texas of the Permian Basin
and the city and county of Andrews is working with
General Atomics of San Diego, Calif., on a very
high-temperature test reactor, considered the next
generation of nuclear reactor.

Construction of the test reactor, which wouldn't
generate electrical power, would cost about $100
million and engineering cost would be $3 million,
said James Wright, technical project director for
the nuclear proposal at UTPB.

The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club and
Sustainable Energy and Economic Development (SEED)
Coalition, both in Austin, have to do research
into the test reactor but are against anything
nuclear.

Andrews residents are reacting positively, so far,
to the proposal, city and county officials said. A
couple of years ago, the community participated in
a strategic plan to boost the local economy and
improve quality of life.

"We're just forward thinking a little bit," County
Judge Richard Dolgener said. "We're able to
negotiate different things for public policy that
work for us."

Nuclear energy will likely be the primary source
of energy for the world in the future with fossil
fuel supply on the decline, Andrews City Manager
Glen Hackler said. The proposed facility would do
one-of-a-kind research if safety and security
issues can be addressed, he said.

"There is a stigma that goes with having a nuclear
waste landfill, but you get prestige with a
nuclear research facility affiliated with the UT
system and one of the renowned firms, General
Atomics," he said.

He said the city and county still have a "great
deal" of due diligence to do before approving the
test reactor, but it isn't as much of a "mountain
to climb" as bringing in WCS.

Dolgener said more public meetings will be
conducted and civic groups can invite Wright and
UTPB President David Watts to speak about the
project. Hopefully, he said the matter can be
brought to the public so they know what it is and
can feel it and touch it.

"I think it's good for the region. It's good for
the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. We
need to stretch our wings here and show what a
major four-year university can do," Dolgener said.

Wright, who worked for the director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory and was one of three people in
charge of internal research and development, said
this technology is the next generation of nuclear
reactor. It can operate at least 1,000 degrees
centigrade (approximately 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit). The reactor cannot have a core
meltdown because it is supposed to automatically
shut down when it reaches 1,500 degrees
centigrade.

The Andrews County reactor would act as a
technological demonstration for one at Idaho
National Lab outside Idaho Falls. Design would
generate electricity at twice the efficiency of
regular electric plants.

The powder-like spent fuel is encased in three
layers of ceramic to be safe for up to 500 years,
Wright said. The pellets can withstand
temperatures of 2,000 centigrade. It would also
deter proliferation as it would cost billions to
remove the uranium from the pinhead-sized pellets.

He said General Atomics, with which UTPB has a
letter of agreement on the project, will supply
the technology and help the university through the
funding process with the federal government and
other sources. General Atomics would operate the
reactor when it's done, he said.

The permitting process will probably cost $60
million and whole project including engineering
and construction, will take six years.

"It would open up a whole new realm of industrial
processes that will help us create new
technologies," Wright said.

If developed, the facility would bring more than
$400 million in direct investment to the state to
be provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. UTPB
is now raising $3 million for preconceptual design
to attract government funding -- half to be spent
by the university and half by General Atomics.
Utilities also won't buy into the reactor without
seeing a prototype.

Wright said he expects at least $40 million a year
in operating funds from the government until at
least 2040 and with that money coming in, he said
visiting scientists would be doing plenty of
research there.

"This project actually fits the national
laboratory model and we've designed it that way,"
he said.

Along with boosting scientific endeavors in the
area, Wright said having the reactor here would
enhance UTPB and help build other non-scientific
programs. The school would likely add an
engineering program and increase the number of
people in physics and chemistry.

"This facility will be unique in the world. It
will help ensure Texas leads development of new
nuclear and hydrogen technology," Wright said.

Sierra Club Communications Director Donna Hoffman
said the organization needs to research the
reactor, but basically doesn't support any new
nuclear facility or nuclear power as a viable
source of energy because of the threat to the
public health and the waste it creates.

"There's no known safe method of storage," Hoffman
said.

SEED Executive Director Karen Hadden said the very
high-temperature reactor sounds like an "extremely
bad idea."

She said there aren't any built in the United
States sand she doesn't see "any good reason for
it to be considered for the region."

"We don't need any more nuclear energy in the
country. We need more renewable energy like wind
and solar. Wind has been productive for West
Texas," having augmented tax bases around the
basin.

Radioactive materials always carry a risk to
workers and the environment, Hadden said, adding
that some nuclear plants in the nation are
leaking.
