<B><font color="black">National Uranium Enrichment Facility = Waste to WCS</B></font><BR>
A proposed $1.3 billion National Uranium Enrichment Facility is still being pushed through to be located in Eunice, NM 
(right next to <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</A>) and operated by Louisiana 
Energy Services (LES), a multinational consortium led by URENCO, including the 
large nuclear companies Westinghouse, Duke Power, Entergy and Exelon.
According to an LES spokesperson, 70 percent of the plant's first 10 years of
production has already been sold, and that the plant would operate for 30 years.  On 02-16-2005, a L.E.S. press release announced that they 
had signed a contract to provide uranium fuel to South Texas Project for the remaining duration of the reactors' license.

These facilities historically leak great amounts 
of both chemical and radioactive pollution into the local region, polluting 
the soil and groundwater, as well as contaminating plant and animal life.

The enrichment plant is projected to generate 133,000 metric tons of
depleted uranium (197,000 metric tons of DUF<sub>6</sub>), which is not allowed to be 
disposed of until undergoing a process called 'deconversion.'  [the depleted uranium hexaflouride (UF<sub>6</sub>) gas must be solidified into 
uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and remaining toxic flouride compound prior to disposal].  
On Feb. 3, intending to quiet concerns that waste would accumulate onsite in New Mexico, 
LES announced a Memorandum of Understanding with the company Areva 
(parent company of Framatome and Cogema), 
to prepare the waste for ultimate disposal, generally presumed to be at <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS's site 
in Andrews County</a>.  Six days after the announcement, LES chief engineer Rod Krich told the
NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the planned 
deconversion facility won't be built in New Mexico after all, and that "the only other site currently being discussed for the waste-treatment
facility is in Texas."  Thus, processing and disposal of this waste could both occur at 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS's Andrews County site</a>. A current trend  in the reclassification of this
and another type of waste called "11e2" (see below on Fernald), could also fast-track disposal at 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wcsandrews.html">WCS</a>.

    Recently Rod Critch, who is LES's VP of nuclear engineering, has said that the waste generated at the plant would be more radioactive 
    than waste at the WIPP site in New Mexico.
  
In February 2005, IEER and NIRS released the report, <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.ieer.org">Costs and Risks of Management and Disposal of 
Depleted Uranium from the National Enrichment Facility Proposed to be Built in Lea County New Mexico by LES</a>.
Relates that depleted uranium is radiologically comparable to transuranic waste, 
and that 
"the health risks of depleted uranium may be far more varied than is recognized in federal regulations today ...
 may be mutagenic, tumorigenic, teratogenic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic, including in a manner analogous to exposure to lead.
    It may also cross the placenta and harm the embryo/fetus. There is also research that indicates that the chemical and 
    radiological toxicities of uranium may, in some cases, be acting in a synergistic manner."

This clustering of many nuclear sites 
in this small region (from Carlsbad to Andrews County) reinforces the view that this area is seen by the nuclear and hazardous waste
industry as a nuclear sacrifice region, with a majority of poor hispanic neighbors not allowed representation in the process.
Indeed, even the New Mexico state government has been denied voicing its health and safety concerns to the federal government, 
very similar to the previous licensing of the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wipp.html">WIPP</A> dump.  A number of other groups
are protesting the NRC blatantly turning a blind eye to the public's concerns, including 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/">Public Citizen</a> and 
<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.nirs.org/">Nuclear Information Resource Service</a>.
