<BR><BR>

<B>More News (from October 2003)</B><BR>
WCS has been up to thier old tricks again- false advertising to generate 
demand and pressure from clients upon regulators. 
Vice-president of program management Michael Lauer wrote a 
5-page advertisement (masquerading as an article) for the July-August 2003
issue of Radwaste Solutions magazine.
<BR><BR>

In the article, the new Texas law is discussed, not surprisingly presented in the
usual confidence which WCS always declares that it has been 
 approved to do things it hasn't yet.  And this time at issue, several 
 things they aren't  yet allowed to do are brought up.
  <BR><BR>
 No company in the United States can 
 currently dispose of the most dangerous type of low-level waste called 
 "greater-than-class C" waste (or GTCC).  This type of waste is so radioactive that
 it is slated to be disposed of with irradiated (spent) fuel by the federal government 
 at a site such as the proposed Yucca Mountain dump.  A bill is currently in U.S. Congress that proposes to allow private corporations like WCS 
to open a dump for this stuff, claiming again (like Texas' HB1567) that doing so is 
in the interest of Homeland Security.   As a partner in GTCC operations, WCS presents 
Nuclear Fuel Services, and confidently comes across as if they will get the bid if 
the bill gets passed.  <BR>

<B>Fallout From 2003 Texas Legislature: TWO New Huge Nuclear Dumps</B><BR>
This years State legislative session moves most of the content on 
this page into a context of historical background.  The new changes to Texas law made 
this year deliver to WCS exactly what they have been wanting for years on a silver platter: 
the ability to dump hundreds of millions of feet of waste in Texas.
<BR><BR>

The new changes to Texas law allow a private company to not only become licensed for the 
disposal of radioactive waste, but to operate two huge dumps at the same site.
Supporters of the bill maintained that other companies could fill this role, but this was 
widely regarded as a joke, since it is understood that WCS is the beneficiary.


<BR><BR>

<table border=1 bgcolor="444400"><TR><TD bgcolor="000000"><img src="imgs/aerial3.jpg"></td></tr></table>
</center>

<BR>


<B>One dump</b> will be dedicated to disposing waste from the Texas Compact.  
This deal includes waste from Texas, Maine and Vermont, but also lets 
waste from anywhere in the United States through a loophole in the Compact law.
Over 95% of all of this waste comes from commercial nuclear power plants.

<BR><BR>

The <B>second</B> dump is exactly what WCS has wanted all along.  This dump is to recieve federal waste, 
which primarily comes from the Department of Energy (DOE), but can also include waste from decommissioned 
Naval vessels.  The rest of what is defined as federal waste actually makes up the majority of whats 
included in DOE waste, that is, waste from "any research, development, testing, or production of 
any atomic weapon."  This nuclear weapons waste from the DOE consists of everything from decommissioned reactor 
vessels used in the production of plutonium, to highly contaminated soils and building materials 
from these all of these facilities.  As discussed in the section on waste amounts, the DOE is going to have hundreds of millions of cubic
feet of waste per decade for many years before these sites will be cleaned up. 
<BR><BR>

With the bill that just 
passed, WCS would be able to take a total of 162 million cubic 
feet of waste at the federal dump, and this is about what could be realistically transported and dumped at 
a facility in the given time.  This was called a waste "cap", but clearly leaves the company unfettered in the short term.
This number may also be raised later if future legislative sessions do so, so in addition to repealing this bill, 
Texas must be very careful that things dont get even worse.  
<BR><BR>

Folks, we are in serious trouble, so please spread the word!
If the public does not act, the dumpsites could later end up taking commercial power plant waste 
from all over the country in unlimited amounts!  Texas must not be allowed 
to be turned into a dumpsite for the DOE or the nuclear industry.

<BR><BR>
This process is going to be drawn out of the next few years, so we still have time to act.
We will be paying close attention to what happens at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ),
the oversight agency, but also elsewhere.  There will be public hearings, and we will also be able to send in 
written testimony and petitions.
<BR><BR>
The Dallas Morning News reported that WCS officials told them that they "hope 
to begin receiving the material as early as 2005."  On the current schedule, the dump can't open until 2008.
This tells us that they will seek to expand the law even further during the next Legislative session,
so that the larger federal dump will be open long before waste from the Compact ever arrives in Texas.
They may also try to increase the sites "capacity" or add more dumps!

The site is at a ranch known as Windmill
Hill in  Andrews County, Texas.  Not only is this disposal site located above two
aquifers, (the Ogallala and the Dockum), but there are also aquifer recharge
features on the property. The Ogallala aquifer ranges under 7 other states: New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota; demonstrating that
opposing the WCS facility is not just a "not-in-my-backyard" stance.  

<BR>
<BR>


Thier hazardous waste pit, where they have dumped several million cubic feet of 
toxic waste and low-radioactivity trash, is actually <B>dug into</B> 
the Ogallala which is around 35 feet below the surface.  It has a plastic 
lining, which historically have been found to leak. The company bought 16,000 acres in it's earlier days
and has licensed 1,600 acres for its hazardous waste disposal area.

<BR>


The presence of the Ogallala, and a 100-year floodplain
which extends through the facility boundary, have been denied by WCS.
  The site is also located within 10 miles of the feedwaters of the Lower Colorado River,
  which flow through Austin 12 blocks from the State Capitol.  This subject has never been raised in any
  discussion on site suitability.

<BR><BR>
The area is also seismically active
with 18 seismic events counted
within a 30 mile radius (48 km). 
Of these, the latest
occurred on June 2, 2001 at a depth of
5 km, with a 3.3 magnitude, and the
largest occurred on January 2, 1992
approximately 15 miles from the site
with a 5.5 magnitude. Eight of these
events happened in 1976 alone.

<BR><BR>

The TDH never conducted an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the WCS Andrews facility.
What was used instead was a report which WCS submitted and which contains some serious flaws.  
It denies the presence of the 
Ogallala aquifer on the property, claiming that each of the other geological
studies done on the site have confused the Ogallala Formation with "Antler's Sandstone."  
The 
Antler aquifer, of which Antler's Sandstone is indigenous to, is in southeastern Oklahoma
and northeast Texas over 350 miles away.

<BR>

A detailed geological survey was conducted of the site in 1993 as part of it's
 application with the TCEQ (then called the TNRCC).  This study is included with the rest of WCS's file at the TDH.
It not only proves 
 the presence of the aquifers at the WCS, but also the 100-year floodplain.  
 The report WCS submitted as an site assessment makes references to this report, yet 
 unscientifically attempts to debunk 
 its most important findings by scratching out the word Ogallala and 
 replacing it with Antlers Sandstone.  
They gave no evidence to support this claim, and the 
State's Bureau of Radiation Control (TxBRC) produced no documented review of the submitted 
site geology.  Later, geological suitability of WCS was criticized by the University of Texas 
Bureau of Economic Geology for not providing sufficient evidence of its claims for suitability as 
a radioactive waste dump.  In response 
WCS changed their story, and developed a second geological survey which showed that the Ogallala 
was <italics>partially there</italics>, yet maintained the presence of the Antler formation.

Waste Control
Specialists is owned by a larger company called Valhi.  Valhi is controlled by a
man named Harold Simmons, who has been known as the second richest man in Texas.
Since Valhi also owns National
Lead Industries, one of the worst polluters in the US, Simmons has also been called 
 the 'king of superfund sites'.

<BR><BR>

Valhi and Simmons give millions in campaign contributions to Texas
representatives.  Simmons was 2nd biggest donor ($90,000) and #1 fundraiser in
the Bush for governor campaign.   He also was a large donor in  two of Jeb Bush's
Florida campaigns.  Through Contran, another company in the Simmons' empire, millions more is also
funneled to GOPAC and the GOP in soft money contributions to influence the political 
process on a national level.  The Houston Chronicle
stated Simmons personally was one of the primary contributors to the Bush
presidential campaign.  Campaign contributions for the year 2000 
include $70,000 for Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, 
$350,000 for Sen. Phil Gramm, and $211,000 for Gov Rick Perry. Just prior to the 2001 
legislature, he gave $10,000 to Sen. Buster Brown, Chairman of the Senate Natural
Resources Committee.

By this November, Simmons contributions to the 2002 Texas election cycle

Not only has Simmons been in court by the US government several times for
violating campaign contribution laws, but he also has been taken to court by his
daughters for making illegal contributions in the names of his own family members
without their consent.  (He settled that lawsuit for $50 million)

<BR><BR>

Both Gayle Norton (Secretary of the Interior), and Dick Cheney (the
Vice-President) were previously employed by Valhi.  Norton was an attorney and
lobbyist for Valhi, defending Natl Lead Industries in lawsuits involving lead paint 
poisoning and schoolchildren. Cheney,
who is well-known as having been the former CEO of Halliburton when primarily
owned by Valhi, presented President Bush's energy plan. (Halliburton's subsidiary
Brown and Root has been heavily involved in Comanche Peak and STNP in Texas, but 
is nationally is quite involved in nukes, including nuclear submarine
manufacturing.)

<B>WCS's License for the Andrews County facility</b><BR>
WCS has a radioactive materials license to process and store radioactive
waste as well as a separate facility with a hazardous materials disposal license. WCS can
receive LLRW for processing and/or storage, and can dispose of  "exempted" LLRW.  Material can be
labeled as "exempted" if found to radiate particles at a small enough amount to
be deemed "below regulatory concern."     
 Once LLRW has been exempted it is outside the regulatory restrictions
placed upon radioactive materials, and can be
transferred to the onsite hazardous waste landfill pit for disposal.
  
[The requirements for exempt
material are defined in 25 TAC &sect; 285.251(c)
(1), which is the Texas counterpart
to 10 CFR 40.13(a)]

<BR><BR>

<B> ----> <a  class="redlink12" href="andrews/openrec.html">View TDH/ TNRCC Open Records 
 Documents about WCS, 1997-2001</a>  </B>


<BR><BR>


For disposal, WCS has been receiving quite a bit of exempted waste over
the years, and it is one of the sites biggest selling points to waste
generators, including the Department of Defense. This is because it is
cheaper to dilute waste and dump it into a landfill than to pay the high
prices of a licensed radioactive waste disposal facility. This material
is not placed in a separate area of the hazardous waste dump, and to
date, neither the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (formerly
TNRCC) or the Texas Bureau of Radiation Control has been keeping track
of the amounts of exempted radioactive waste which are disposed of at
WCS.  Several hundred-thousand cubic feet of this waste
 has been dumped at Andrews.

<BR><BR>

<table border=1 bgcolor="444400"><TR><TD bgcolor="000000"><img src="imgs/wcsaer4pit.jpg"></td></tr></table>

<BR>


One of the things WCS does is store waste onsite. During 2001-2002, WCS
succeeded in obtaining NRC permission for increased volumes of Special
Nuclear Material, which is the most volatile subcategory of low-level
radioactive wastes, including materials containing fissionable
plutonium and uranium which aren't source materials themselves. (the NRC
can designate any material as Special Nuclear Material under certain
provisions, such as in the interest of National Security) (USC 42 &sect;&sect; 
2014, 2071, NRC.)


<BR><BR>
WCS has been trying to obtain a license for radioactive material disposal for years, but until 2003 
Texas law
has prohibited a private company from operating a dump.  WCS uses a strategy of inching it's 
way as close as possible by attempting to obtaining license amendments and intensely lobbying the 
Texas legislature.  Some feel that the buildup of disposed exempted wastes may be a ploy to 
charge that radioactive waste is already disposed of there, as an excuse for future conversion 
to a full disposal license.  In addition, WCS is also seeking a separate type of radioactive 
disposal license for what is called 11e2 byproduct waste. 

<BR><BR>
Byproduct wastes is generated under conditions of uranium ore milling,
where wastes known as tailings are produced, and in the refinement of
uranium from that ore. Tailings are slated for cleanup under a program
called the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project (UMTRA). In
addition, 11e2 byproduct waste also originates from Cold War bomb
development projects known as the Manhattan Project, which were
conducted at sites across the country. A project to clean up this waste
is called the Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Program, which is
run by the Army Corp of Engineers, who has even been known to send this
material to municipal landfills when authorized to do so.

<B>WCS's Reputation around the Texas Capitol Nothing New</B><BR>
 


Andrews County has a long history in the oil business.  In 1929, when oil was discovered, Andrews became the largest
oil producer in the US.  In 1966, the Chamber of Commerce formed the Andrews Industrial Foundation (AIF), a small group of wealthy
business leaders, which would control economic development in the County to present day.
During the OPEC embargo of 1973, the sharp rise in oil prices stimulated oil production and profit in Andrews.  
After the oil boom, prices dropped, and the AIF began to look to other means to attract new business.  Throughout the 1980s, 
the Foundation began lobby for nuclear industry projects.  When the DOE was investigating the suitability of Deaf Smith 
County for high level waste disposal (later sited at Yucca Mountain), Andrews had actively sought to also be a candidate.
Andrews was also runner-up in the bid for the Superconducting Super-Collider project.  None of these proposals met suitability 
requirements, primarily due to the presence of the Ogallala aquifer in the county.
By 1986, oil prices hit bottom, and Andrews' economy was drooping from it's previous heights.  
<BR><BR>

June 1987, the TLLRWDA had been contacted about 
siting a disposal facility owned by the University of Texas about 20 miles east 
of the town of Andrews.  When the TLLRWDA visited the proposed site and noted that the site was 
probably not suitable due to the proximity of the Ogallala,  the Andrews Board asked to begin
 drilling test holes to demonstrate this wasn't the case, which they did, and found the Ogallala 
 40 feet just below the site.  The TLLRWDA newsletter said, "protection of the State's waters is 
 perhaps the most important siting criteria that the authority must meet.  With the presence of 
 the country's largest aquifer located a mere 40 feet below the surface, the Andrews County site was
  immediately disqualified."  (as a sidenote, it should be pointed out here that water issues were never a concern of the 
  TLLRWDA when it came to the Sierra Blanca dump, and this had contributed to a feud between the Andrews Industrial Foundation
   (including WCS) and the TLLRWDA).
<BR><BR>
Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) was formed in 1989 by Houston Industrialist Ken Bigham, with the goal of building 
 a hazardous waste dump.  Bigham bought 16,000 acres in Andrews on the Texas-New Mexico State Line 
and planned a 11,274,000 cubic yard landfill on the property.  In March of 1993, WCS applied to the TNRCC for a RCRA Part B 
permit, which allows disposal of all hazardous chemical waste (over 2,000 toxic substances), and were granted a license in
record time by August 1994.  Less than one year later, WCS cited a declining market for hazardous waste disposal, and with the
blessing of the Andrews Industrial Foundation, began to bid for the disposal of "low-level" and mixed radioactive wastes.

<BR><BR>

In 1995, WCS lobbied the Texas Legislature, and caused quite a stir-up when two of their lobbyists, 
John Birdwell and former congressman Kent Hance, were exposed trying to get an outspoken 
republican opponent of their radioactive
 waste bill to change his mind by promising $60,000 in campaign contributions in the next elections.
 Reps Robert Talton (R-Pasadena) and Ray Allen (R-Grand Prarie) reported the incident to the executive 
 assistant to House Speaker Pete Laney, and the District Attorneys office.  
 Allen stated that he had been approached by Birdwell who said of Talton,"why, they would put $60,000
 in his campaign in a heartbeat if he would back off."  Allen stated that "it certainly sounded like 
 a bribe using campaign contributions... 
 There was clearly a linkage between the campaign contributions and Robert dropping his opposition."
Tarlton mentioned that Hance had also approached him concerning a possible opening in his law firm 
(Hance, Scarborough, Woodward, and Weisbart) 
becoming available if he dropped opposition to the bill.  "He implied that he needed another lawyer
 in Houston," Talton said. "And I said I made over $1 million last year, and I don't need this."

 <BR><BR>
Hance denied everything.  He stated that it was a "cheap trick" 
to kill the bill, and went on to say "it is an absolute lie... I don't know what he is smoking.  
This guy is out of control.  The bill comes up tomorrow, and he hates my client."
Hance was refering to the fact that Talton knew Ken Bigham, then-president of WCS, and had some disagreement 
over 20 years before when Talton was on the Pasadena police force, and Bigham had worked for the Harris County
Sheriffs Office.  
Hance claimed that Talton had said he still hates Bigham and
said of Talton, "he's going to do whatever he can to get rid of him."  Talton explained that he and 
Bigham had a disagreement, but that it was 20-25 years ago, and that he hadn't seen Bigham since.
Addressing the entire situation, including Hance's suggestion that opposing the bill was some sort of 
vindictive move by Talton, Rep Allen pretty much summed it up saying, "this is a stinky deal, and the public needs 
to get a whiff of this"
<BR><BR>
This bill was introduced by Senator Teel Bivins, and would have allowed a private company to obtain a radioactive
 waste disposal license.  WCS could then bring in and dump enormous portions of waste without hinderance.
The bill was killed, revived, and killed again during the closing days of the Session.  In future legislatures, 
 Senator Bivins would continue to introduce bills which would enable WCS to become a national radioactive waste dump.
 
 <BR><BR>
This episode was obviously a huge embarrassment to WCS, but they were soon rescued in November, when
 50% of WCS was bought by Dallas-based Valhi Inc., run by billionaire Harold Simmons, 
who is a personal friend of George W. Bush and major contributor to his campaigns.  Simmons had a reputation for
funnelling massive campaign contributions to state and federal candidates, and had an team of 
high paid Washington lobbyists to orchestrate these Congressional allies when elected.

   Between 1994 and June of 1996, according to the Dallas Morning News, Simmons, Bigham and Hance
donated over $170,000 to Governor Bush and Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock. 
Simmons had also discussed the issue with Bush when Governor. "I basically told George that I was involved 
in the company as a major investor," Simmons told the Morning News, "and I wanted him to be aware of 
it in case the issue ever came up."

Billy Clayton, and Carl Parker</td></tr></table>
</center>

<BR>

 
The lobbying team for WCS has been made up almost exclusively of ex-state officials and congressmen.
Leading up the team was Kent Hance, former Railroad Commissioner, who represented Andrews County when he was a
Congressman in the 1980s.  Hance was a WCS major stockholder and Chairman with an option to buy 25% of the company.  Carl Parker is
 a former state senator (D-Port Arthur); Chet Brooks, a former state senator; Cliff Johnson, former state
 representative from Palestine who served as commissioner of the Texas Water Board; Jim Rudd, 
 former state rep from Brownfield; Daryl Owen, former top aide to the senate energy committee.


<BR><BR>
 
 
WCS was in hostile competition with the State of Texas LLRWDA, who was busy attempting to build a dump of their own.
 At a
legislative agenda meeting of El Paso city, county, and state officials held December 1996, a
resolution opposing the Sierra Blanca site was unanimously approved. According to those present, only
one official wanted to request specifically that the compact dump be moved to Andrews County: El Paso state
representative Pat Haggerty. Ethics Commission filings show that Haggerty received campaign donations
from Ken Bigham, and WCS lobbyists Chet Brooks and Carl Parker - all on the same
day, and only a few weeks prior to the El Paso meeting. 


<BR><BR>

  By early 1997, WCS had submitted an application and soon afterward was granted a license
   to process and store, but not dispose radioactive
  waste at Andrews.  This and the 75th legislature occured in the midst of a 
  20-month lawsuit between WCS and the DOE.
  
The Dallas Morning News obtained court documents after
the dismissal of the WCS vs DOE lawsuit in 1998 which
revealed a number of things about WCS's character.  

In line with the Simmons-Valhi reputation, WCS had been hiring well-connected lobbyists in Washington, for example,
former top Senate Energy Committee aide Daryl Owen had been lobbying for WCS since October 1995, and 
was promised a huge $18.4 million award if successful.  By this time, Simmons, Bigham and others connected to WCS had
 already donated over $90,000 to key senators and House members.  
 <BR><BR>


Also revealed was that Kent Hance had asked three senators who had recieved large WCS contributions
to block the nomination of Mary Anne Sullivan for DOE General Counsel, which succeeded
 [the three were Shelby (R-Alaska), Hutchison (R-Texas) and Gramm (R-Texas)]. 
WCS was even getting its congressional allies to assist in things like letterwriting campaigns.
One targeted at Energy Secretary Federico Pena asked him why his department was still doing business with Envirocare,
and urging him to reconsider WCS proposals during the WCS vs DOE lawsuit.  Gramm, Hutchison, and Shelby were among the 
letterwriters, which included one letter signed by 18 of the 30 Texas House members, nine of whom had received 
donations from top WCS supporters.
<BR><BR>

Wright Andrews, past president of the American League of Lobbyists, said WCS's lobbying has been hard-edged, 
even for Washington.
"It sounds as thought this has been an exceptionally aggressive and very political lobbying effort."  He continued
that he had lobbied Congress on nuclear waste issues before, "but it sounds like it is high-stakes"



<BR><BR>

Repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, WCS would introduce bills into every Texas Legislature which would allow a private 
company to be granted a disposal license, thus allowing them to dump waste in unrestricted amounts from all over the nation.
Not unlike a child who repeatedly asks the same question over and over until the targeted adult, exasperated,
 gives in with the desired answer, WCS continues to harrass our elected officials and regulatory agencies to have 
 its way with changing Texas Law to obtain the hundreds of billions in profits it seeks.  When the vast
 campaign contributions and other breaches of ethics reaches critical mass, it becomes clear 
 that the adults are forced to discipline the child, meaning that at some point the abuse of corporate accountability
 will reach a point where  State and Federal governments will have to say "enough's enough."

In 2003, after the site was legislatively-enabled to become a dumpsite for the nations waste,
the Dallas Morning News printed an article attempting to demonstrate local support for the dump, 
with interviews from the Andrews Chamber of Commerce, which houses the Andrews Industrial Foundation.  
It also interviewed manager who previously worked for a hazardous waste incinerator, assuring that 
everything was safe in the neighborhood.  

<BR><BR>

Most notably, WCS is practicing a public relations campaign which has been seen before
in Sierra Blanca.  Recruiting and inventing poster children from local high schools. 
 The Morning News article quoted a Andrews High School graduate "who admits to not
knowing much about the science of the plan" saying "the company's community
involvement influenced her opinions.<BR>

"...She noticed Waste Control Specialists' presence after the facility opened in 1997 and new
faces starting showing up at school and the company logo began appearing on
softball and Little League uniforms.  Then this year, the company gave her a $1,000 scholarship- 
for which she never applied- to defray tuition at the University of North Texas, where
she plans in the fall to study marketing or public relations. Several
classmates received the same gift, she said.
<BR><BR>
"It was pretty cool that they picked me", working behind
the counter at her job inside Ribbons and Bows, a gift shop on Andrews'
central street. "I don't really know how [the site] affects us. But it
doesn't affect my daily life."
</span></td></TR></table>
</center>
<BR>
Notice that this means WCS has been doing this heavy saturation marketing onto children
in Andrews since she herself was approximately in the 6th grade (1997- 6 years previous).   
The fact that WCS has been indoctrinating the local 
stakeholder population for years must be a considered factor in this case.
<BR>
This is such a familiar story, repeated elsewhere innumerous times by different hazardous chemical and nuclear 
industries.<BR>

  <B>The DOE v.s WCS Lawsuit (Sept 1996-May 1998) : Bypassing State Law</B><BR>
  Envirocare's Utah site is the nation's only state-licensed
private low-level waste dump, and has been the source of much aggressive
rivalry with WCS.   During a lawsuit with the DOE, WCS claimed that Envirocare had 
monopoly status on dumping DOE waste, and that WCS should also be able to open a DOE dump in Texas and reap the 
promised billions in profits.   Before WCS  delivered its proposal to the DOE or the TNRCC in the case, Envirocare
 Chief Executive Khosrow Semnani 
  bought up 880 acres near the WCS site and notified the TNRCC of an intent to license a federal DOE dump
  which served as a pre-emptive strike against WCS, forcing a TNRCC
  policy decision before WCS could act. 
<BR><BR>
 Since WCS was unable to change Texas law in 1995 to allow a private company a 
license for a dump, they prepared a method to bypass state law.
In September 1996, WCS submitted a bid in response to a DOE open call for proposals to take waste from it's plant in 
Fernald, Ohio.  Part of the deal was that the company must take title to the waste, and be able to get the proper 
disposal permits.  The DOE did not see WCS as qualifying, and just about the same time on 
October 18, TNRCC denied Envirocare's request for a license, 
saying it didnt have the legal authority to grant such a permit under state law.  
TNRCC executive director Dan Pearson sent a letter to WCS saying the same thing, and
emphasized that as a matter of policy the agency was opposed to "any scenario or arrangement" that 
involved state oversight of a private disposal
  facility. 
<BR><BR>
In a second letter, Pearson suggested that a federally regulated DOE site was a legal feasibility,
and if such a proposal were formally made it would merely require a policy decision by the TNRCC's three
commissioners, who were all Bush appointees.  
WCS's response was to submit another proposal to the DOE which outlined how they could operate a dump legally
 under DOE contract without obtaining a state or NRC license.  This also involved a research 
 partnership with Texas Tech University.
 They had hoped that if the DOE opened a site 
 with them at Andrews, that this would 
exclude the State of Texas from having any say in the process, for they claimed that as a DOE contracted site, 
they should be exempted from State regulation. 
 Citing internal policy, the DOE said they couldn't do it, so WCS filed a complaint saying its proposal could be lawfully
  implemented and that DOE unfairly rejected the proposal.  DOE responded that they did see what WCS proposed
  as being lawful, but that alternative regulatory agreements such as suggested were not covered under a poilicy decicion.  
  <BR><BR>

On October 3, 1997, Judge Joe Kendall of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Wichita Falls 
Division, heard WCS' case against DOE, and issued a preliminary injunction against DOE.
He determines that a state and/or NRC permit is not necessary for DOE radioactive waste disposal at a
privately-owned site under contract with DOE. The injunction barred DOE from awarding contracts for the disposal of
low-level and/or mixed radioactive wastes without considering bids from WCS.


  <BR><BR>


 By February 1998 the lawsuit sped up when it came to the attention of the National Governors' Association, who weren't too pleased 
 that the DOE considered the WCS proposal as legal (since it infringed on state rights).  WCS started asking for injunctive reliefs such as:
preventing the DOE from using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contracts to ship their low-level wastes to
 Envirocare's private dump in Utah; and, keeping the DOE from shipping low-level wastes to states unless an agreement
  existed with a particular state.  Two days later, sixteen states responded very concerned, with an amicus brief
  of a full statement condemning WCS's arguments.  
  
  <BR><BR>
  Among other things they said, 
"if a privately owned and operated facility that seeks to profit from disposing 
radioactive waste generated by DOE is exempt from external regulation, public health
 and the environment may be severely compromised. Radiation protection regulations 
 must not be rendered ineffective merely because a private facility agrees to dispose
  DOE waste."  They continued that "the WCS proposal cannot be implemented under the Atomic Energy Act. 
  WCS is not exempt from State regulation simply because it disposes DOE waste at its privately owned and 
  operated facility. Further, disposal of DOE waste at the WCS facility in the absence of State regulation
   is inconsistent with the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985."
    <BR><BR>

U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the preliminary injunctions placed upon the
DOE and dismissed the case in May 1998.  However, the court not only denied entering the amicus brief the states had filed
 but also found that the district court was correct 
in determining that a state or NRC license is not required for a private site to dispose of 
low-level or mixed radioactive waste from the DOE, but that the DOE has the discretion to require a state or 
NRC license before granting a contract.

  <BR><BR>
<B>"The DOE has identified this case for what it really is, an effort to dictate waste 
<BR>
management policy to 
the agency (and the nation) that, not coincidentally, 
would<BR> offer WCS a way to evade Texas state law
and serve the firm's economic interests."
