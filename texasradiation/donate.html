First off, thank you for your interest in donating to Texas Radiation Online.  
You may either use your credit card or send a wire transfer using PayPal.  
There has been a PO Box provided for 
people to send in material through snail mail, but due to a lack of a budget, we can no longer 
provide this option.

<BR><BR>

Before proceeding, it is really 
important to emphasize that Texas Radiation Online does not have a 501(c)(3) status.
This means that donations which are provided are not currently tax deductable.

Sometime in the future, we will obtain 501(c)(3) status.  We feel that the decision to operate 
under another organization's non-profit filing status is one which must not be 
taken lightly, and might imply more of an affiliation symbolically or in 
project responsibility than exists in reality.  Under careful consideration, 
a decision in regards to providing 501(c)(3) will be made in the future.

&bull;  <B>Getting factsheets and fliers printed.</b><BR>
These materials are necessary for tabling at 
events and for getting information in the hands of those without internet access.  
<BR><BR>

&bull;  <B>Keeping the project going.</b><BR>
This is a project with a shoestring budget and without an office.  Occassional 
long-distance calls must be made around Texas to make it function. 
The project also needs a PO Box for people who are scared of donating with online 
transactions.  [I won't give out my family's address for this- too risky].
Much of the books and office equipment which support the project 
have to be kept in a storage room, which has a monthly fee.  
<BR><BR>

&bull;  <B>Covering the basics.</b><BR>
Unemployment is bad in Austin Texas.  There is little or no income for 
the author to maintain the project on.  Occassionally, a bit of contract work employs the author,
but is very rare and not enough to get back into an apartment.  Currently, he is staying on his 
family's couch, so any money helps to cover basic necessities.  [this is a mixed blessing- 
this project would have never developed if unemployment wasn't so bad the last two years!]
<BR>
10-2003 Update: the author now has a part time office job till December

&bull;
Future: Web hosting is currently donated,
and the computer equipment currently in use was purchased when the author 
was employed as a programmer.  Things such as office space or 
replacing broken computer equipment are currently seen as a long-term goals, 
which would have to wait until we have an underwriting sponsor who would be 
willing to come forth and assist us with such items.  Unfortunately, project development 
prior to the 78th Texas State Legislature took all time which would have been
utilized to write for grants to support the project.  It is hoped that after the 
Legislature is finished, these sorts of activities may be pursued.
