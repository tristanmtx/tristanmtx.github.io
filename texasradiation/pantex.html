The
Pantex Plant's current functions include
the fabrication of chemical high
explosives; high-explosives development
work in support of the design laboratories;
and nuclear weapons assembly,
disassembly, testing, quality assurance,
repair, retirement, and disposal.
  The most significant aspect of Pantex's current operation is its role as
the primary site for storage of weapons plutonium 
in the United States.  Capacity was increased in the mid-90's,
and by 1999 the number had doubled to 12,067 plutonium pits onsite (about 60 tons).  
The site is currently allowed to store up to 20,000 pits.

<b>Pantex Nuclear Weapons Plant</b>
<br>

The Department of Energy's Pantex plant occupies 16,000 acres (25 square miles), 
17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas, just outside of the small town Panhandle, 
 north of U. S. Highway 60 in Carson County.

The Pantex site was established in 1942 after forcing residents off of the land by power of eminent domain, and started 
by loading TNT and other explosives into conventional
shells.   In 1950, the site was selected for nuclear weapons work, and soon after granted 
a concurrent  partnership with Texas Tech University. 
After extensive renovations were 
completed in 1952, the first assembly of nuclear bombs (Mk-6) soon occurred. 
Throughout the Cold War, components which had been fabricated across the nation at
DOE labs were brought to Pantex to be assembled into the US stockpile of nuclear weapons.   

With the end of the Cold War, the DOE nuclear weapons complex shifted from weapons
 production to weapons dismantling and disarmament.  The Department has said that the
last new nuclear weapon (a W88 warhead) was assembled at the site on July 31, 1990. 
However, B-61 "bunker busters" for hardened targets, and other nuclear weapons have since been made 
out of the old as research and development continues for those weapons sought
by the military and the Bush Administration.  There is more on what that vision is 
later toward the end when we discuss the future of Pantex.

<BR><BR>


Plutonium pits, the spherical metal cores of 
thermonuclear weapons, are removed from the warheads and placed in 
stainless steel containers that resemble 55-gallon drums.  These drums are stored in protective bunkers
officially called "Modified Richmond Magazines" but also called "igloos."
Other bunkers, called "gravel gerties," are used as work areas where the weapons
 are armed or disarmed with the plutonium pit.
Before the mid 1990's, there were 18 bunkers at Pantex storing
6000 plutonium pits.  In addition, over 33 tons of 
plutonium in other forms was stored, including processing residues and metal scrap.  
Under stakeholder protest, capacity was increased in the mid-90's,
and by 1999 the number had doubled to 12,067 plutonium pits onsite (about 60 tons).  The site is currently allowed to store up to 20,000 pits.

B61-11 "bunker busters." The B61-11's major difference is that it adjusts to different altitudes and 
impact heights.   Pantex also has assembled 8 weapon designs after 1995- 
cruise missles and W88 first designs to be reproduced.

<b>Faulty Environmental Assessment</b>
<br>
The decision to expand Pantex raised very serious concerns about excess plutonium at the 
site, and a 1993 proposal for a national research lab to study new uses of plutonium.  When the 
DOE released its 1992 <I>Environmental Assessment on Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at the 
Pantex Nuclear Weapons facility</i>, it met strong criticism from State agencies and officials, 
who called the study "fundamentally flawed", "deficient", and incomplete 
(Gov Richards, AG Morales).  Roger Mulder, the governor's special projects director for 
environmental policy stated "We think they did not do their homework. I don't know
anyone who realistically thinks we'll have a solution 10 years from now, and then the question 
becomes 'does Pantex become a de facto (storage) site'?"
<BR><BR>

Thomas Griffy, UT Austin physics professor, said "the environmental 
impacts of this decision need to be carefully assessed.  One cannot 
judge from the document provided whether or not this has been done.  
(It) creates the impression of providing a detailed analysis while at 
the same time withholding some of the essential data on which those 
calculations are based. The report as it stands appears to be a full and 
open discussion of the problem when in fact it is not."
 
Auburn L. Mitchell, Acting Associate Director for UT's Bureau of Economic Geology, responded
to part of the EA concerning potential impacts upon the Ogallala aquifer.  
Addressing a hypothetical accident in which plutonium is released into the atmosphere, dispersed
by wind, and deposited on the land, he questioned whether surface soils could be decontaminated 
to the level stated in the report considering the length of cleanup time. 
"The potential for soil and 
groundwater contamination at initial post accident levels during the cleanup period cannot be 
summarily excluded."
<BR><BR>

<b>Site Contamination and Health Problems</b>
<br>
Pantex has a history of contamination on and outside of the property.
Until recently, the found contaminants were primarily chemical, not radioactive, since Pantex did nuclear assembly later on.
With increased emphasis placed on handling plutonium and tritium, 
the possibility of radioactive contamination rose.  

When manufacturing conventional weapons, workers had used water lathes to shape blocks of explosive. The chemical wastewater 
drained into ditches or shallow lakes creating sludge with high concentrations of explosives. During the five decades 
since the plant was built, the EPA has documented gasoline spills, burning of explosives, and disposal of heavy
 metals in treated wastewater such as lead, arsenic, mercury and barium.  This wastewater was used by farmers for irrigation.  
Uranium and tritium  have also been found in low
  levels within a half mile of the plant.  
(a plutonium pit's design includes a small tube to insert the tritium/deuterium inside- seals break at this 
point and create a pathway out).
  
  Waste oils and solvents contaminated with high explosives were disposed of
  and allowed to percolate and evaporate in an unlined waste pit for 26 years.  The total liquid waste
   disposed of in this pit was never recorded, and ranges between from 90,000 to 350,000 gallons of chemicals.
   For example, 3,000 gallons of the carcinogen toluene were disposed of in this manner in 1978.

Boyd Deaver of the TNRCC stated, "It was a common practice for a long time to just burn things in the burn pits.  They didn't
know what they burned... what they released into the air.  The bottom line was getting the bomb out, not the environment."


<BR><BR>

In May of 1994, the Pantex site was designated as a Superfund site.  
The governors office had opposed the move stating that another federal 
environmental law (RCRA) requiring 
sufficient
cleanup standards was already enforced by DOE, EPA, and the State of Texas;
that not only would superfund increase 
procedural requirements and drive up the cost to taxpayers, but the move "would threaten the state's ability to
oversee and participate in the remediation."  Tom Walton, Energy Department spokesman, spoke on behalf of the plant,
saying "this could put a stigma on us... an undeserved stigma."     
Federal officials explained that since depleted uranium had been found 
near the site in trace amounts, RCRA, which does not regulate radioactive materials, would be insufficient, and that
invoking CERCLA, the Superfund law, would be required to handle the situation.
Beverly Gattis of STAND agreed.  "The point is it is not a judgement call; it's based on evidence, and if evidence 
supports the (hazard ranking) scores, then sure I think it's fair and right that people should know that this is 
an important cleanup that needs to be done," she said.  Don Hancock of the Southwest Research Institute added that 
"at a superfund site, there is regulatory authority over radionuclides, and there are cleanup standards that have to be met in terms
of remediation or cleanup-type activities."

<BR><BR>




Also in 1994,  unpublished Health Department statistics revealed that the
rate of leukemia deaths in Carson County was more than twice the
statewide average for the decade of 1981-1991.  Death rates from brain
cancer were slightly elevated in neighboring Potter and Randall Counties,
and thyroid cancer death rates among Potter County women were higher
than the rest of the state. 

 Previously, the Health Department had conducted a small survey and concluded in 1992 that there was an overall 
  lower rate of cancer in the area.  However, after independent research done by Susan Lee using figures from the 
  Texas Cancer Registry demonstrated the limited scope of the survey, the Health Department was 
  forced to revisit the study and ended up confirming Susan Lee's findings.

Dr. Steven Galson, chief medical officer in the DOE's Office of Environment, Safety, and Health, stated the 
numbers were "clearly alarming... They are high enough to raise anyone's eyebrows. 
 Elevated cancer rates of that order of magnitude warrant further investigation as to the cause"
<BR><BR>

When the study was released, Jim and Jeri Osborne, who had been keeping track of their neighbor's
 cancer deaths, stated that
5 of the 7 farmers who irrigated their crops with treated sewage water from the plant had died of 
cancer, mostly with lymphomas. A sixth farmer had been battling cancer for the past five years.  
They also noted that five farmers who cultivated or harvested crops on the grounds of the plant 
had also died with cancers.  "I am not trying to scare anyone", said Osborne, 56, who then chaired
 the county's republican party, "All I want to do is make them aware of what is going on."  

 The Osborne's have kept a map of Carson County marked with colored pins, each representing the
 death of a cancer victim.  At the time of this interview, the count was 235.    They decided to start the project when
 two of their neighbors had died of cancer within the same week.  Later, they noticed a pattern, with 
 pins tending toward the north by northeast of the Pantex property. 

 <BR><BR>

 Dorothy Bell, who resides in Armstrong
 County maintains a similar map for her own county, and shows 71 cancer victims. Her husband worked at
 Pantex from 1959 to 1989.  He said he did not question plant operations until 1987, when he was
 directed to drill a uranium slug out of a vessel and was exposed to radioactive dust and fumes.
 Toxicologists were still treating him for a series of ailments which led to his retirement.  
Bell won a workers compensation award,  which the plant had appealled. The couple has also 
filed a negligence suit against Pantex.  
<BR><BR>

Later, in November of 1994, UT Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology announced that it had found
traces of high explosive and nitrate contamination in the Ogallala aquifer 2 to 3 miles from 
the Amarillo water field, Amarillo's water supply.  This included traces of TNT (trinitrotoluene), RDX (research developed explosives) 
and HMX (high-melting explosives).  RDX is used as a rat poison and can damage the central nervous system.
 TNRCC officials stated that there was no readily available data of the health effects of 
these explosives in groundwater.

State officials had speculated that an existing layer of clay would prevent seepage into the Ogallala.
Mavis Belisle, director of the organization Peace Farm which monitors activity at Pantex, stated "Theres a forty
 to fifty year backlog of stuff that is not in the aquifer but is somewhere in between.  We now know that it takes
 50 years to get through that hard clay." 

<BR><BR>
A year later in 1995, officials reported that several neighboring 
farms tested showed 
much higher concentrations of explosives in the water, as much as 57 parts per billion, about 
10 times what is considered safe by drinking water standards.
  A well on the site perimeter showed levels of 
high explosives at 5000 parts per billion, or 1000 times higher than safe drinking water
 standards allow.
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>

<b>Plant Safety and Incidents</b><BR>
Just prior to the superfund designation, Pantex was forced to shutdown for several months to address safety concerns due to several 
incidents which had occured over the past few months.

On February 2, warning lights on a radiation warning system failed due to previous software modifications to the fail-safe system.  
It was discovered that no records of the revisions to the software were ever required or maintained, so the direct cause 
of the malfunction was unclear.

On February 24, an inspector found that a valve on an automatic water-deluge system, functional only when open, was left closed
by a preventative maintenance team working on the fire-protection system.

On March 19, a tritium gas alarm went off due to a malfunction.  No radioactivity was found, but investigators recommended a 
full cause analysis because of "repetitive" alarm system deficiencies.

On March 29, weapons technicians were locked in a disassembly bay when the automatic door system malfunctioned.  One technician
managed to escape through a cargo door. 

On April 4, failures in the air filtration system were discovered by a weekend maintenance crew.  The crew failed to notify the 
technicians and work started normally the following Monday.  It was later that afternoon that the failure was reported to plant 
personnel.  During the subsequent investigation, it became clear that three months of preventative maintenance records had been 
wiped out in a "computer glitch".  The problem with the air filtration systems was similar to an occurence in February,
when an investigator for the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB)
observed workers taking apart an 8-inch artillery-fired nuclear warhead in a building
with an inoperatable filtration system.  John Conway, chairman of the DNFSB, stated that "particularly disturbing is 
the observation that operating personnel were not trained or
knowledgeable of the safety envelope or the critical systems."
  
<BR><BR>

A congressional source involved in oversight at Pantex said that one of the major problems is
the preventative maintenance program and a lack of reliable records for safety systems.  "if something like this happened at a
 commercial nuclear facility," he said, "you'd see fines and penalties immediately.  It was a serious gap here."

 <img src="pantexgerties.jpg"></td>
<td class="tddkbrown">


  "Gravel gerties" is a name for circular rooms 33 feet in diameter capped with 
17 feet of sand and gravel.  This gravel is held up with a lattice of cabling and chain-link fence.  Supposedly, this is to be
 sufficient to absorb the power of an accidental detonation of the conventional explosive components.  
 The logic is that the roof would collapse and trap gasified 
 plutonium in the rubble.  A study by the DOE Plutonium Vulnerability Working Group concluded that the storage containers 
 used to store pits do not provide an effective containment barrier, and that the effects of aging on the pits, such as 
 corrosion and cracking, are unknown.  
  </td></tr></table>
 
 
<BR><BR>



In July 1994, Dallas Morning News reported that the gravel gerties had gaps measuring up to 3/4 of an inch on 
the steel doors that could lead to radioactive releases, and that they were first identified as a safety concern in 
a "secret appendix" to a 1983 Environmental Impact Statement. 

It was found that these gaps occured due to repeated opening and closing of the doors, and that negative pressurization
 did not help sufficiently since the gaps were too large.
As strange as not having already fixed the problem, it was after a 1996 
 environmental survey team report restated the problem that Pantex finally started filling these leaks, 12 years later.  
 "It's like having a hole, a square-foot in the wall, through which some of the airborne plutonium would blow," said physicist
 Frank von Hippel, former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
 Airborne plutonium spreading within a 1.6 kilometer radius would increase the risk of cancer death by 25%, he said.
   
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that a written statement from Mason & Hanger claimed the
 leaks "were not sealed sooner  because the plant chose to stress accident prevention
 instead."
 
 <BR><BR>
 As of 2005, the gravel gerties made news again when it was reported that the sealant around the doors was peeling.  
 AP reported that according 
 to a July 21 report by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, a 6-year-old work order to repair the 
 faulty door welds  was never completed, and that it would cost another  $20 million to address the problem.
 During Pantex's  safety review, other structural cracks were also found which would also have to be addressed.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <BR><BR>


 Other questions about the safety of the gravel gerties and bunkers were raised.
Pantex and the DOE often referred to the bunkers as high-tech, failsafe chambers which keep airborne radiation from scattering
 in an accidental explosion.  The leaks around the blast doors were not only a concern over releases during plant procedures, but
 also the containment concern in the event of an explosion.
 Chances of an explosion of a gravel gertie are claimed by federal officials to be remote, but as 
 Beverly Gattis explains, "you are always caught in the boggle that 'this isn't likely to happen,'
 
  still, 12 years is a long time to 
 ignore something that has the potential for harm.  It seems astonishing that 12 years and millions of dollars later that this 
 still is not fixed."

A majority of plutonium pits were stored in Zone 4 "bunkers" which are about 35-50 years old, and weren't 
designed for long-term storage or to withstand an airplane crash.  The DOE promised that interim storage in these 
buildings would last only 6-10 years, and interim storage at Pantex was projected to be at least 50 years.
Zone 4 was also in a flightpath, posing the risk of an 
severe accident.  Based on an assumption that two new bunkers would be available in Zone 12,
the DOE promised to move the pits to the improved bunkers.
</font></td></tr></table>
</center>























<BR><BR>




The bunkers in Zone 12 proved to be less than suitable for the task.  During the construction and upgrading of the buildings,
cost cutting had gone so far as remove environmental/humidity control equipment from the plans.  This equipment is particularly 
crucial considering that the pit containers require a strict humidity controlled environment.  The DNFSB concluded, "this
decision was made at some risk, because strategic pits are unlikely to be repackaged soon in sealed containers."

<BR><BR>
One of the Zone 12 buildings, 12-116, was to hold 4000 "strategic" pits.  These pits were scheduled to remain in 
long-term storage at Pantex even if DOE had another disposition for surplus plutonium.  The other 12,546 surplus
plutonium pits were destined for Building 12-66, which was soon later assessed to not be able to stand a crash from a small 
commercial helicopter.  The DOE decided to instead to increase the number of Zone 4 magazines with active cooling. 
 There was no mention of adding humidity controls for the AL-R8 containers.
 
 Pantex is 8.5 miles from the Amarillo National Airport, where in addition, the Department of Defense continues to conduct Air Force 
 training flights over the bunkers.
 



<BR><BR>

In 1996, whistleblower complaints had led to an investigation by the Government Accountability Project, who interviewed
several dozen Pantex employees about safety concerns and found that
"the kinds of things we are hearing is that it's not ok for a worker at Pantex to raise a safety and health or environmental 
allegation- or talk to anybody- to talk to the DOE or to GAP...  is going to be career-threatening, 
that there will be reprisal against you."  A DOE investigation into a previous complaint noted that two workers were reluctant to 
raise safety issues with supervisors.

<br><br>
Dan Fairfax, a 44-year-old former Pantex employee, had charged in a 1993 complaint that plant officials retaliated
against him for reporting alleged nuclear safety violations.  Along with other safety concerns, he reported that in March 1993, he was present in an assembly cell where weapons work was being done; that workers were not wearing 
required protective clothing while removing high explosives from a plutonium pit.  He was not properly informed by his escort that a 
radiation work permit (required posted guidelines for working in a radiologically-controlled area) was posted for the cell, and stood by 
a plutonium pit  for about five minutes before he was told that it was special nuclear material.
  The DOE Office of Nuclear Safety Enforcement investigated, and 
reported that the "problems he raise either lacked safety significance or were ongoing issues known to the DOE."  The report refuted
nearly all of the allegations reported by Fairfax, yet recommended corrective measures for some of the safety issues he had raised.
Fairfax said investigators detailed his concerns, but downplayed his allegations.  Fairfax was soon afterward given an unsatisfactory 
job review for reporting safety hazards, was threatened with firing, and offered a transfer to another job at Pantex.  "If you read the
executive summary, it just whitewashes everything," said Fairfax, "I got screwed and tattooed because I raised nuclear safety issues."

<br><BR>



<B>Plutonium Storage and National Security</b>
<BR>
The largest issue with storing plutonium is security.  It is virtually impossible to "immobilize" plutonium, (to place it in an
unrecoverable state), to ensure that disarmament is permanent, and that the plutonium is not reused by 
"rogue governments" or terrorists.  For the atomic bomb at Nagasaki, only 14 pounds of plutonium was utilized.  Just 6 to 10
pounds is enough to build a nuclear weapon. 
<BR><BR>









<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" background="dkbrownteevee.jpg" bgcolor="#002200">
<tr><td width=250><img src="PlutoniumPuck.jpg"></td>
<td width=350>
<span class="newstdtext10"><font color="#000000">
The prefered method of immobilizing plutonium is a process called vitrification.  This involves placing plutonium 
(which is in puck form) in a downward 
spiral arrangement, and surrounding the material in radioactive glass (often cesium-137 based).  The spiral arrangement ensures that the plutonium pucks 
 have some distance from each other and do not form a critical mass.  Smaller canisters like this are placed
 in a similar spiral arrangement and "glassified" in the same manner, creating large logs.  Vitrification has also been seen as a 
 means of mobilizing uranium-235.  Unfortunately, vitrification is sometimes seen as too expensive despite its security
 advantages, although no alternative exists at this time.</font></td></tr></table>
</center>





 
<BR><BR>
Plutonium at Pantex is not handled in a such a responsibly elaborate manner as vitrification promises.  
Plutonium pits are already clad in either beryllium or stainless-steel, which keeps the plutonium from being exposed to air, oxidizing into a 
powder, and becoming a very dangerous inhalation hazard.  However, this cladding is deteriorating, and in 1994, 
DOE's Plutonium Vulnerability Assessment Team cited reliance upon cladding as the
 most significant vulnerability at Pantex.
 
 <BR><BR>
 
Pantex also came under fire for storing 
plutonium in deteriorating substandard
cases called AL-R8 containers, which are known to "contribute to rather than mitigate" pit corrosion.  These unsealed
 containers themselves are corroded and failing- procured without "required corrosion-resistant coating on the inner surface."  
Over 2,000 containers had corroded according to a Sandia Labs memo.  
The Nat'l Academy of Sciences had stated in 1994 that storage at pantex "could be continued for the next few decades without undue risk,
provided that an adequate program to monitor the pits' status and respond to any problems was maintained."

Pantex inspected its 10,000+ pits at a rate of 30 pits a year, and the DNFSB recommends 100% inspection every five years for AL-R8 packaged pits.
This demonstrates that the DOE can't state with any confidence whether or not the pits are safe.
<BR><BR>
  
The solution the DOE promised was to utilize another container, the AT-400A,
but due to repeated technical difficulties and cost it was determined to be ineffective.  Internal memos on the topic emphasize that "cheap prevails,"
and the program to replace the AL-R8 was labeled by DOE the "cheap container" program.
<BR><BR>

<B>Mixed-Oxide Fuel Production (MOx)</B><BR>
Plutonium is also seen as a component element of Mixed Oxide (MOx) fuel fabrication.  The plutonium metal is converted to plutonium 
oxide powder, which is mixed with uranuim oxide powder, refined, and then pressed into MOx pellets.  


MOx fuel burns much faster and hotter than uranium fuel, and is extremely dangerous to use in a reactor.  Fast-flux
reactors designed for the use of MOx fuels have been in the experimental phases, and have not proved to be economically viable
 or safe from fires.  It has been estimated that if Pantex becomes involved in MOx fuel fabrication, it will annually produce over 300 cubic meters 
of transuranic waste, 
over 150 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste, and over 80 cubic meters of mixed low-level radioactive waste, 
in addition to releasing 1,000 micrograms of plutonium in air emmissions.
Ingestion or inhalation of as little as 30-60
micrograms of these dusts is an enormous cancer risk  (a packet of sugar or sugar substitute contains about 
one million micrograms).  

<BR><BR>


<b>The Future of Nuclear Weapons and Pantex</b>
<br>

It is unclear how long plutonium will remain stored at Pantex.  Several actions have taken place since 2001 which have
 turned back the clock, literally, on nuclear weapons disarmament in the United States. 


<BR><BR>
 - Commercial Reactors Producing Tritium
<BR>
Within a month of the attacks on September 11th, the Bush Administration advanced a Clinton plan to use
one or more commercial nuclear plant reactors in Tennessee to produce tritium.   Watts Bar is designated as the first to begin.  
It would be the  first time that the US has made civilian nuclear plants part of the
vast complex that produces and maintains the nuclear arsenal.  Previously, the United States encouraged other 
countries to follow the American example and not combine civilian nuclear energy and nuclear weapons
programs.  
<BR><BR>
"They might just say that if the United States is doing this, then the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty is history," stated physicist Kenneth Bergeron, who spent
25 years at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.,
researching reactor safety and tritium production.
Tritium in existing nuclear weapons decays and becomes ineffective to multiply the fission reaction of the plutonium in the weapon.
However, DOE officials have previously stated that the US nuclear stockpile would not need another tritium boost until 2011
<BR><BR>


 - The Nuclear Posture Review
<BR>
In 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act had been passed, and by February 2002, The Nuclear 
Posture Review which it mandated was submitted to congress, outlining a 12 year strategy with regard to the 
nuclear weapons stockpile.  It states that an increase in the US nuclear weapons stockpile is imminent, and
plans the specific development of subkiloton "mini-nukes" for deployment in addition to modernization of 
larger yield weapons.  This also ensures that Pantex will be going back into production mode.


<BR><BR>

 - "Doomsday Clock" Updated To Indicate More Serious Threat of Nuclear War
<BR>
February 27, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moves the minute hand
 of the "Doomsday Clock," the symbol of nuclear danger, from nine to seven minutes to midnight, the same setting 
 at which the clock had its debut 55 years ago.  Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, this is the third time the 
 hand has moved forward.  Reasons cited for the current change include the US abandoning the ABM treaty and 
 planning to manufacture more nuclear weapons, and the tensions between India and Pakistan.


<BR><BR>
 - 2002 US-Russia Disarmament Treaty Fails to Mandate Plutonium Immobilization
<BR>
In 2002, President Bush signed a disarmament treaty with Russia which actually enabled the US to not have to destroy weapons, 
but to merely store them ensuring that nuclear stockpiling would not be hindered.  This does NOT mean that the plutonium will be 
immobilized or vitrified, and DOES mean that plutonium storage at Pantex will continue.


<BR><BR>
 - US Restarting Plutonium Pit Production  
<BR>
In June 2002, DOE announced plans to resume production of plutonium pits.  This decision was made after reviewing
a Bush Administration study declaring the US stockpile insufficient to pose a nuclear deterrent.
The department halted production of pits in 1989.  The National Nuclear Security Administration
stated that a new facility costing between $2.2- $4.4 billion would be built at an existing DOE 
site.  It was not stated which site would host the facility, but it is strongly being currently considered for either Pantex, WIPP,
or Savannah River.
 <BR><BR>
 
 Refering to the refurbishing of existing pits which are in storage at Pantex, the department had stated that
 the tons already in storage "cannot meet long-term needs."
 What this means for Pantex is obviously more weapons production operations, with or without it becoming a pit production site.
The current US nuclear weapons policy guarantees a reverse in Pantex's mission from decommissioning back to 
 building thermonuclear bombs as during the cold war.
