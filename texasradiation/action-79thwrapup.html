<BR>"Relating to transferring certain responsibilities of the Department of State Health Services concerning radioactive materials to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality; imposing fees and surcharges."
<BR>[This bill was passed by the Senate on 05-04-2005]
<BR> Our take: Regulatory authority should be given to the TCEQ as the introduced bill lays out.  
As far as taxation on waste goes, while we agree that there are ethical arguments and supply-and-demand dynamics to consider 
concerning the use of waste importation as a source of State revenue, CSSB1567 already created revenue streams from nuclear waste (LLW), so we think 
the way to resolve that issue is to repeal last session's CSSB1567.  If the TDSHS licensed a site, which they can already do (and probably will), 
there would be no revenue from the 11(e)(2) dump at all, and regulation would be lax.  This fixes both problems by establishing fees and 
giving oversight to a more competent agency.  We approve of this bill, though it could use some amendments 
such as the propositions of HCR85 and HB1656 (below).  
Placing caps on, or repealing the Federal waste dump from last session's CSSB1567 isn't such a bad idea either, 
although it appears less than probable.  We propose that the reveune stated in this bill should go to the 
Radioactive Waste Perpetual Care Fund, rather than to the State or County General Revenue streams.
<BR>
Note: An important item was added in the committee substitute which limits public participation in the licensing of mining sites.
We do not approve of or endorse this measure and want it taken out.  
Later, the bill had a few senate floor amendments.  Two most notable was an attempt to limit waste imports to States 
within the Texas Compact, and another which would create an joint committee to study radioactive waste issues (quite similar to HCR85).
Both of these amendments by Sen. Shapleigh were not passed by the Senate.  Sen. Duncan stated that although these were good amendments, 
he felt that they may hurt the passage of the bill and should be considered as separate legislation.

<BR>[Bill has been left pending in committee]
<BR>"Requesting the lieutenant governor and speaker to appoint a joint interim committee to study issues relating to the importation of radioactive waste into Texas."
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/committees/cmtembrs.d2w/report?LEG=79&SESS=R&CMTECODE=C250&CHAMBER=H&CTYPE=House">Contact Information: House Energy Resources Committee Members</a>
<BR> Our take: Why not? This should have at least been passed as an amendment to last session's CSSB1567, if not prior.  <BR>
During the committee hearing April  28, 
Cmte Chairman Rep. "Buddy" West tried to hurry up testimony, interrupting and questioning the relevance of discussing L.E.S. activities, 
despite its obvious relevancy plus being specifically mentioned 
in the preamble to the bill as a very notable waste stream.  This waste is already stated to be destined for WCS, which is right next door.
Proponents for waste disposal continue to testify 
that transporting nuclear waste across our freeways and metro areas is good for national security, the County of Andrews, and that the WCS site's 
"impenetrable redbed clay" 
protects our aquifers, although the Ogallala aquifer resides above this debunked supposed barrier for all radionuclides and toxins, not below it.

and see below for more evidence of "Buddy" West's convenient cluelessness on our State's nuclear waste policy.

<BR>"Relating to the transfer of the regulation of injection wells used for in situ uranium mining from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to the Railroad Commission of Texas."
<BR>[This bill was approved in Committee and has been scheduled for consideration by the Calendars Committee for the House Floor]

  <BR> Our take: This bill is absurd.  While Duncan is trying to do the right thing with SB1667 by consolidating radioactive waste, processing and disposal
 under the oversight of TCEQ, this bill would give these polluted sites with onsite mining disposal to the Railroad Commission, 
 which is unqualified with this type of waste.  (the Railroad Commission oversees oil and gas NORM waste- see the <a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="wastetypes">waste types overview</A>).

<BR>"Relating to licensing the disposal of certain low-level radioactive wastes."
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-<a class="redlink"  target="_blank" href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/committees/cmtembrs.d2w/report?LEG=79&SESS=R&CMTECODE=C260&CHAMBER=H&CTYPE=House">Contact Information: House Environmental Regulation Committee Members</a>
<BR> Our take: This bill closes the infamous Texas Compact loophole, and that is a good thing.  We're for it.
