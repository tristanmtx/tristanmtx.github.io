<B>The fall and rise of uranium prices</b>
<BR>
As
press reports claiming uranium prices
are 'exploding' appear and the number
of new uranium exploration licenses
thus increase (even in Europe: Finland,
Sweden), it is time to pay some
attention to it. Historically, the
uranium price has varied considerably
in response to supply and demand,
although an open market did not exist
in the early times since the U.S.
government was the sole purchaser. By
the end of the 1970s, the spot price had
peaked at approx. US$ 43/lb U3O8 in
response to increased U.S. government
demand; it soon leveled off to approx.
US$ 10/lb U3O8, leading bit by bit to
the shutdown of nearly all conventional
mining in the U.S.; only in-situ
leach mining continued at a low level.

With the end of the Cold War in 1989,
large amounts of secondary resources
entered the market, and the price kept
fluctuating around this level in the 
1990s, with a minor peak in mid-1996
at US$ 16.60/lb U3O8. At that time it
appeared that secondary supplies
would come to an end, but the price
dropped again, until it reached a low
of approx. US$ 7/lb U3O8 by the end of
the year 2000. Since then it has been
rising, currently with increasing speed,
and has more than quadrupled.

<BR><BR>
The first conventional mines in the
U.S. have restarted after decades of
inactivity and the uranium exploration
business attracts all kinds of
venturesome investors now; the list of
uranium mining and exploration
companies maintained at the WISE
Uranium home page shows more than
250 entries now. The rise in prices even
induced a new business model. In
anticipation of a further rise in market
prices, a company named Uranium
Participation Corp., managed by
uranium miner Denison Mines Inc.,
was established in March 2005, its sole
purpose "to invest in, hold and sell
uranium oxides in concentrates
(U3O8)". Taking inflation into account,
current price levels are still far below
those at the end of the 1970s. In
addition, the spot market price does
not necessarily reflect the prices
actually paid, since only a small
fraction of the uranium is traded on
the spot market; it is more a
hypersensitive indicator of the shortterm
supply and demand situation.
